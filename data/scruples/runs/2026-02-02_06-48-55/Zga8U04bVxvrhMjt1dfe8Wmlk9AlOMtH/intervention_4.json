He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends after the guy rejected her because she was \"too fat.\" I need to analyze this step by step.\n\nFirst, the guy was initially attracted to her personality and even called her \"refreshing,\" which suggests a strong connection. The author was upfront about her weight gain by sending full body and nude pictures, which is honest and responsible. Then, during a face-time, he wanted her to show herself again. She did, but left abruptly due to anxiety. His response was to say, \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl,\" which is a pretty direct and dismissive comment. That's not nice, and it's hurtful because it reduces her insecurity to her size, which she already shared with him.\n\nAfter that, he ignored her for hours when she asked if he wanted to continue talking. Ignoring someone after a rejection isn't respectful. It leaves her hanging and can cause emotional distress. The author then sends a message taking his silence as an answer, which is a reasonable way to handle the situation when someone is clearly not responding. The guy later texts her saying he was into looks and that she's too fat for him, which is the actual rejection. The author then decides not to stay friends, which the user is considering whether it's wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the guy's lack of respect in his communication. First, he rejected her in a hurtful way, then ignored her instead of being direct. The author's decision to not continue the friendship is a personal choice based on the way she was treated. She's allowed to set boundaries and prioritize her self-esteem. The guy's behavior\u2014being rude, ignoring, and then expressing his physical preferences after initial connection\u2014was not respectful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for distancing herself from someone who treated her poorly. So the answer should be B.\n"
