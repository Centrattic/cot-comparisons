He was really into my personality, liked that I was sarcastic and introverted like him. We joked, we flirted, and eventually he wanted to call and talk to me on the phone. We talked on the phone until 2am, we were really vibing and he called me \"refreshing\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the past year, I've been slowly putting on some weight due to major stressors in my life. I'm 5'7\" and about \\~ 180lbs while I used to be about 150lbs. Knowing this, I sent him full body pictures of myself (even a nude) to be upfront about how I looked and let him decide if he was physically attracted to my body. He was and everything was fine...until yesterday.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe face-timed and he wanted me to stand up and show him my body, I guess as like a final decision as to whether or not he would consider himself attracted to me. He stood up and showed me himself. He was chubbier than I expected, definitely overweight, but I was really enjoying our connection so I accepted what he looked like. Plus we both spoke about how we're not at our best and that we were both in the process of losing weight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI admit, I was anxious to show him myself, not because I lied about anything, I was very blunt about having gained weight and how I was in the gym working it off (already down 10lbs!) Eventually I showed him my body and sorta abruptly said bye out of fear. I texted him instead.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe said to me \"I understand why you're insecure, it's because you're a bigger girl.\" I was sorta thrown off by that, and I asked him if he wanted to keep talking or not. He proceeded to ignore me for hours and eventually I texted him and said \"I will take your silence as an answer.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHours go by and he eventually texts me something along the lines of how \"looks really matter for me\" and that I was too fat, FOR HIM. I told him I would leave him alone then and wished him well, but that upset him as he said he wanted to continue talking.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**I was mostly uninterested to continuing to talk because of how he handled the situation. We went from texting non-stop for days, to him ignoring me instead of just telling me his feelings, and leaving me hanging for 6 hours. (I know he was free because we made plans to meet that night during those hours.) I felt horrible about myself. I felt he didn't respect me anymore because I was no longer attractive to him so it was fine to be rude and ignore me.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: AITA for not wanting to stay friends with a guy who rejected me for being \"too fat\". He saw my body, ignored me for hours and then was upset when I didn't want to stay friends.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends with someone who rejected them for being too fat. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author, a 21-year-old woman, met a guy on Tinder. They connected well, talked a lot, and he seemed interested in her personality. She even shared her full-body photos, including nude ones, to be upfront about her weight gain. She mentioned she's been gaining weight due to stress but is working on losing it. Then, during a video call, he asked her to stand up, she did, and he later told her he found her too fat. He ignored her for hours before finally texting her that looks matter and she's too fat. The author then decided not to stay friends, feeling he didn't respect her after the rejection.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong for not wanting to stay friends. The user initially thought she is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's comments about her weight being a deal-breaker are problematic. Weight-based rejection is a common issue, and it's important to note that body shaming is not acceptable. The man's behavior of ignoring her for hours is also inconsiderate. He could have communicated his feelings directly instead of leaving her in the dark. \n\nOn the other hand, the author chose to not stay friends. Sometimes people get rejected and move on, but the key here is the method and the context. The guy's actions were hurtful and disrespectful. The author's decision to cut off the friendship is a personal choice, and given the circumstances, it's understandable. She felt disrespected and upset, which is valid. \n\nFriendship requires mutual respect. If someone treats you poorly, it's reasonable to distance yourself. The author isn't being cruel; she's prioritizing her self-respect. The guy's behavior was the root of the problem. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong for choosing not to stay friends. \n\nI should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Did she give him a chance to apologize? Well, he was upset when she decided to leave, but the initial rejection was based on appearance, which is a significant issue. People have the right to leave toxic relationships or friendships where they aren't valued. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
