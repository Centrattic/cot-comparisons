I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a prank war between siblings that escalated.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked his sister with an empty Xbox box, which made her cry. Now, she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. He's cutting her off because of this.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. Let's break it down. \n\nThe initial prank he pulled led to his sister crying, which isn't great. Then he was pranked back in a way that caused him significant embarrassment. The sister's prank was exposing his private collection, which is a big invasion of privacy and could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe author is now cutting off his sister. The question is if he's the asshole for doing so. From a typical \"Am I the Asshole\" perspective, people often judge based on whether the punishment fits the crime or if there was a clear escalation.\n\nThe sister's prank was more harmful and invasive. She exposed his personal stuff to family and his (then) girlfriend, causing emotional harm and family tension. The author's initial prank, while hurtful, didn't have the same level of impact. \n\nHowever, the author had a history of pranking, and the sister's retaliation was extreme. But in terms of accountability, the sister's actions were worse. The author cutting off a sibling after such a violation might be seen as justified, especially if the sister is continuing to mock him. \n\nBut the author also participated in the prank war, so some might say he should take part responsibility. However, the sister's action was a significant escalation. In many cases, when someone's revenge is way over the top, the one who did the worse act is the one in the wrong. \n\nSo the author isn't the asshole here. His sister overstepped, and cutting her off is a reasonable response. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
