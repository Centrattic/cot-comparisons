I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank war. The situation involves two pranks: the author initially gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Later, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family during a visit from a girl.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the pranks and their impacts. The first prank (Xbox box with a brick) caused the sister to cry, which is pretty harsh. The author might have thought it was a joke, but causing emotional distress is a problem. The sister's retaliation involved exposing private, personal items in front of family and a potential romantic interest. This is a significant violation of privacy and trust.\n\nNow, the author is cutting off their sister, claiming it's because she went too far. The key question is whether the author's actions (pranking first, then cutting off) make them the asshole. \n\nThe initial prank likely upset the sister, leading to her retaliation. However, the sister's action was more harmful, as it involved exposing something personal and causing long-term family tension. The author's response to cut off the sister could be seen as justified given the severe impact of the retaliation. But the author also initiated the prank that led to this conflict. \n\nHowever, the sister escalated the situation by using a more damaging prank. The author might feel justified in cutting off someone who betrayed their trust, especially after the initial prank. But the author also contributed to the conflict with their first prank. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some fault. The author started the prank war, but the sister's retaliation was more harmful. The author's decision to cut off the sister might be a reaction to the final straw, but it's important to consider if there's a way to address the issue without cutting off a family member. However, the sister's action was a major betrayal, so the author's decision could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nIn summary, while the author initiated the conflict with the prank, the sister's retaliation was significantly worse. The author's response to cut off the sister could be seen as a result of the sister's actions, so the author might not be the asshole here. The answer is B (not in the wrong), but with consideration that both have some responsibility.\n"
