I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a prank war between the siblings.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox filled with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to their family during a visit. The author is now cutting off the sister and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the pranks and the escalation. The author's initial prank was pretty harsh, leading to the sister crying. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing the author's private collection, causing significant embarrassment. The author is saying that the sister overstepped, but they're also acknowledging they started the prank war.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were justified. Pranks can be a form of light-hearted teasing, but when they cause emotional harm, they cross a line. The initial prank made the sister cry, which suggests it was too far. Then the sister's prank was even more severe. The author is cutting off their sister, which is a significant consequence. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, both sides did something wrong, but the sister's prank had more severe consequences. However, the author's initial prank started the conflict. The author is now cutting off the sister, which might be excessive. But since the sister escalated the situation, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The original prank was bad, but the sister's prank was worse. The author is cutting off the sister as a response. In terms of accountability, both are at fault, but the sister's action was more hurtful. The author's response might be seen as justified given the sister's overstep. However, cutting someone off completely for a prank might be too harsh. \n\nBut since the user is asking for A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (No, they aren't), the answer would likely be B. The sister's prank was worse, so the author isn't the asshole for cutting her off. The initial prank was their fault, but the sister's retaliation was more severe, so the author's response is understandable, even if not perfect. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
