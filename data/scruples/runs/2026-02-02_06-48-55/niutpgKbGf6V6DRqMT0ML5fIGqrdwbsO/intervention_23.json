I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The original situation involved the author pranking their sister by giving her an Xbox that was just a box with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga to the family in front of a girl he had over. The author is upset and cut off the sister, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The author's initial prank led to his sister crying, which is a strong reaction. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which caused significant embarrassment. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the pranks and the escalation. The first prank by the author was harmful (causing emotional distress), and the sister's response, while also harmful, was a direct retaliation. However, exposing someone's private items in front of family and a guest is a serious invasion of privacy and could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of prior pranks.\n\nThe author is now cutting off the sister. The question is whether this is justified. The author might believe it's a fair response to the sister's actions, but the sister's prank had real consequences (humiliation, family disapproval, etc.). However, the author's initial prank also was problematic. The sister's action was a response to the author's prior prank, but that doesn't necessarily justify her action. Both parties escalated the situation.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the sister's action was more harmful and invasive, but the author's initial prank contributed to the conflict. Cutting someone off can be a reaction, but if the sister's action was a clear violation, then the author's response might be seen as self-defense. However, the author's initial prank was also an issue. The question is whether the author's response (cutting off the sister) is justified given the sister's action.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong here. The sister's action was worse, but the author's prior prank set the stage. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the sister's action was more severe, and cutting her off is a reasonable response to protect his reputation and privacy. However, the author's initial prank was also a problem, which complicates things. But in the context of the final prank, the sister's action was the straw that broke the camel's back, so cutting her off could be justified.\n"
