I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is the asshole (AITA) after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves two pranks: one where the author gave their sister a fake Xbox (a box with a brick), which made her cry, and then the sister retaliating by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his friend.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: the author gave a fake Xbox. The sister was upset and it led to her crying. That seems harsh. But then the sister sought revenge. Now, her revenge was exposing his private collection. The author is now cutting her off. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. The author started the prank war with a prank that caused emotional harm. The sister retaliated with a prank that caused significant embarrassment and family conflict. \n\n2. The sister's prank was more severe because it involved exposing private, sensitive material in front of family and his girlfriend, leading to lasting damage in family relations and his reputation.\n\n3. The author is cutting off the sister, which is a significant action. But is that justified? \n\nThe question is whether the sister's prank was disproportionate to the original prank. The author's prank caused emotional distress, but the sister's prank caused public humiliation and potential damage to relationships. \n\nHowever, the author is also taking revenge by cutting off the sister. Is that a reasonable response? The sister's prank was worse, but the author's initial prank started the cycle. \n\nBut in terms of current actions, the author is cutting off the sister because she crossed a line. The sister's action was worse, so the author might feel justified. However, cutting off a sibling is a big step. But if the sister's prank was so severe, maybe it's understandable. \n\nAlternatively, the author's initial prank was the catalyst. But if the sister's prank was worse, then the author isn't entirely the asshole. The key is whether the author's reaction is disproportionate. The sister's prank had more severe consequences. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the sister escalated the situation with a more harmful prank, and the author reacted to protect himself from further harm.\n"
