I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about two siblings pranking each other. The author previously gave his sister an Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Now she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection in front of his family and a girl he's interested in. The author is cutting her off and asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial prank. Giving a sister an empty box with a brick, making her cry\u2014this seems harsh. Pranks are common, but when they cause emotional harm, they might be crossing a line. The author might have thought it was funny, but if it upset her, that's a problem.\n\nNow, the sister's revenge. She took the adult manga and showed it to the family. The author is upset because this is very embarrassing. But was her action justified? The author had a secret collection, and the sister exposed it. But does that equal the prank he did? The key here is proportionality. The initial prank caused emotional distress, and the sister's retaliation caused public humiliation. Both are serious, but maybe the sister's action was worse because it had lasting consequences on the author's family relationships.\n\nBut then, the author is cutting off his sister. Is that a reasonable response? If someone wrongs you, cutting off communication is a strong step. However, if both sides were at fault, the author might be overreacting. The sister's prank was extreme, but was it warranted because of the prior prank? Retaliation can escalate conflicts. The author might be in the wrong for continuing the cycle of pranks and then cutting off his sister. \n\nAlso, the author's initial prank led to the sister's revenge. Maybe both are responsible. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off. The sister's action was worse, but the author's prior prank might have contributed. However, cutting off a sibling over this might be too harsh. The author could address the issue without cutting her off, like discussing the problem instead of mutual retaliation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions (prank leading to cutting off) might not be entirely his fault, but the sister's prank was also extreme. However, the author's initial prank started the conflict. The sister's response was more harmful, but the author's retaliation (cutting off) might be justified given the harm caused. But maybe the author should have handled it differently instead of cutting off communication. So, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
