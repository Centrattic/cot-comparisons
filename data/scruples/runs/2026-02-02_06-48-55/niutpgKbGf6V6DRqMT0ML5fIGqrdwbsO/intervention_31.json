I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a prank where the author gave their sister a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection in front of his family and a girl he's seeing. The author now refuses to talk to his sister and wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial prank: the author gave his sister an Xbox box with a brick. This made her cry, which is pretty harsh. Pranks can be harmless, but when they cause emotional harm like crying, they cross a line. So the author's initial prank was probably mean-spirited and not good.\n\nNow the sister's retaliation. She took his adult manga and showed them to the family and the girl. The author is upset because it's embarrassing, and his family is upset too. But the sister's action was a direct response to his prank. The author's prank caused her emotional pain, so her retaliation, while also inappropriate, might be seen as a reaction to that.\n\nThe key here is mutual escalation. The author started the prank war with something that hurt his sister, and she responded in kind. The author is now cutting off his sister, but both sides have done something wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong now for cutting her off. If the sister's prank was an overreaction, maybe the author shouldn't retaliate. But if the sister's prank was a justified response to the initial harm, then the author cutting her off might be the real issue.\n\nAlso, the author is now facing the consequences of his actions. His sister's prank led to his family being upset and the girl mocking him. But was that entirely his sister's fault, or did he set the stage by being the first to do a harmful prank? The sister's action was more public and damaging, but the author's initial prank was also hurtful.\n\nSo, while both are at fault, the author's decision to cut off his sister might be the asshole move because he's escalating the conflict instead of taking responsibility for his initial prank. The sister's prank, while bad, was a reaction. The author's cutting her off is a harsher punishment. Therefore, the author might be the asshole here.\n"
