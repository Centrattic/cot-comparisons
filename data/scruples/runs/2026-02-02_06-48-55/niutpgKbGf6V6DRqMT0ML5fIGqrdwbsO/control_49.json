I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. The sister cried because of that. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family during a visit from a potential girlfriend. The author feels humiliated and has cut off the sister, asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nI need to analyze both sides. The author's prank involved deception and made the sister cry, which is pretty harsh. However, the sister's retaliation was revealing private, potentially embarrassing material to the family in front of the author's guest. The author is now cut off from the sister and is asking if that's justified.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks and the consequences. The initial prank was hurtful, but the sister's response was even more severe. The author's reaction of cutting off the sister is understandable given the humiliation, but does that make them the asshole? Or does the initial prank (Xbox with a brick) contribute to the problem?\n\nMoral judgments can be tricky. The sister's action was a direct attack on the author's privacy and social standing within the family. The author's response of cutting ties might be seen as self-defense after the sister overstepped. However, the author's own prank was also harmful, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of Reddit's AITA standards, typically, if someone escalates a conflict in a way that causes significant harm, they might be called out. Here, the sister's action was more harmful and public. The author's retaliation (cutting off) might be seen as a justified response to a serious transgression, especially after the sister broke trust by exposing private things. The initial prank's severity is notable, but the sister's revenge was worse. \n\nSo, considering both pranks and the consequences, the sister's actions were more damaging. The author might not be the asshole here because the sister's action was a severe breach, and cutting off after that is a reasonable boundary. The answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
