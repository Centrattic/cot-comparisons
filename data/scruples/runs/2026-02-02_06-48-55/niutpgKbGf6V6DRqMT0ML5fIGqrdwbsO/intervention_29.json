I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a cycle of pranks leading to a severe consequence.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: The author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. The sister was upset and cried, which the author admitted was wrong. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of a friend. The author now feels justified in cutting off the sister.\n\nThe key points to consider are the proportionality of the pranks and the escalation. The first prank (the brick Xbox) caused emotional harm, which is one thing. But the sister's response was much more invasive and damaging. Exposing someone's private collection in front of family and a friend is a significant violation of privacy and trust. It likely caused lasting embarrassment and strained family relationships.\n\nThe author's prior prank (the brick Xbox) led to crying, which the author already felt bad about. The sister's prank, however, was more malicious and had broader consequences. The author is now cutting off the sister, but is that justified? The sister crossed a line by invading the author's privacy and sharing sensitive material. However, the author's initial prank also hurt the sister emotionally.\n\nBut the question is about the author cutting off the sister. The author's action (cutting off) is a reaction to the sister's prank. The sister's prank was worse in terms of impact. However, the author's cycle of pranks started with them. The sister's retaliation escalated things. However, the author's final action is to cut off the sister, which is a personal choice. The sister's prank was clearly worse, so the author's cutting off might be justified. But the author's initial prank wasn't entirely innocent either. However, the sister's response was far more harmful. So, the author's reaction to cut off the sister is in response to a more severe violation. Therefore, the author might not be the asshole here. \n\nBut considering the sister's actions were worse, maybe the author is justified. But the initial prank (the brick Xbox) was also cruel. The sister's response was worse, but the author's cutting off is a personal choice. The sister's prank was worse, so the author isn't in the wrong for cutting her off. Therefore, answer B.\n"
