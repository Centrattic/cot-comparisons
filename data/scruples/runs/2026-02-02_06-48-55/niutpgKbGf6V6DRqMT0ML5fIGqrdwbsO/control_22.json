I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank war between siblings that escalated.\n\nFirst, the author had previously pranked his sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick inside, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to his family and a girl he was seeing. The author is now cutting off his sister and is asking if he's the asshole for doing so.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial prank and the sister's revenge. The author thinks that because he was pranked first, the sister's actions are worse, but he's cutting her off. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, pranks that cause emotional harm can be problematic. The first prank made his sister cry, which is pretty harsh. Then, the sister's revenge was exposing something personal and potentially embarrassing. The author's response is to cut off his sister, which is a significant consequence.\n\nBut is the author the asshole? Well, he initiated the prank that led to her crying. The sister's revenge was more invasive, but maybe proportionality matters. The author might feel justified, but cutting off a sibling is a big step. However, the sister's action was more about public humiliation and invading privacy, which could be seen as worse. \n\nBut the author also has to consider that he started it. However, the sister's actions had a bigger impact. The author's response is cutting off contact, which is a personal choice, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn some perspectives, both are at fault. The author for starting the prank war, and the sister for escalating it. But the Reddit community often looks at who did the more harmful action. The sister's exposure of private items in front of family and a guest is more severe. So maybe the author isn't the asshole. \n\nBut maybe the author is the asshole because he started the prank war and then was pranked. But since the sister escalated it, perhaps the author is justified in cutting her off. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. The initial prank (Xbox) was harmful, leading to the sister's revenge. The sister's action was worse, so the author's response of cutting her off might be seen as not being the asshole. But maybe the author should have handled it differently. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because the sister's action was more harmful and invasive, and cutting her off is a reasonable response after her betrayal. Plus, the prank war was initiated by the author, but the sister's actions were worse. So the author isn't the asshole.\n"
