I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The user previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox that was actually just a brick. That prank made her cry, as mentioned. Now, the sister has retaliated by exposing the user's adult manga collection to the family and a girl who was visiting. The user is upset and has cut off their sister, but they're questioning if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics of the prank war. The user started the initial prank, which was harsh enough to make their sister cry. Then the sister took revenge by exposing something personal and sensitive. The user is now cutting off their sister, but they're wondering if that's justified.\n\nThe key points here are about the escalating pranks and the harm caused. The first prank involved deception (giving a brick instead of an Xbox) leading to emotional distress. The sister's response was to reveal the user's private collection, which is a more serious invasion of privacy and could cause significant embarrassment. \n\nThe user's argument is that the sister's prank was worse than the initial one, so they're justified in cutting her off. However, the sister acted out of revenge, which might not be a good excuse, but the exposure of private materials is a big deal. The user, on the other hand, had a history of pranking, which is part of the problem. The sister's action crossed a line into public humiliation and privacy violation, which is more severe than a prank that might be considered a joke, even if it was cruel. \n\nBut is cutting off the sister an appropriate response? The user is now the one taking the offensive action, so maybe their response is also inconsiderate. However, the sister's act was intentional and harmful. The user might feel that their privacy was violated, leading to family disapproval and personal embarrassment. \n\nOn the other hand, the user's initial prank was also harmful, so there's a cycle of retaliation. The sister's prank was a direct response to the user's previous actions. Even if the user's act of cutting off their sister is a harsh measure, the sister's prank was a significant breach. \n\nBut family relationships are important, and cutting someone off is a serious step. The user might be holding onto their anger from the initial prank, which they shouldn't have done in the first place. The sister's prank, while hurtful, might be the result of the user's prior provocation. \n\nSo, the user's initial prank was wrong, which started the cycle. The sister's retaliation was also wrong, but perhaps even more so. The user is now cutting off their sister, which could be seen as a defensive measure or as adding to the conflict. The question is whether the user is the asshole for cutting off their sister. \n\nConsidering that the user initiated the first prank, which was harmful, and the sister's response was worse, but the user is now taking the step to end contact. The sister's action is more severe, but the user's initial prank was also problematic. The user might be in the wrong for continuing the cycle of pranks and then cutting off their sister, but the sister's prank was worse. \n\nThe Reddit context suggests that pranks can be okay if they don't cause harm, but making someone cry is definitely on the wrong side. Then the sister escalated it by exposing private items. The user's response is cutting off, which is their choice, but whether they are the asshole depends on if cutting off is a reasonable reaction after both sides have acted poorly. \n\nIn the end, while the sister's action was worse, the user's initial prank was also harmful, and the cycle of retaliation is part of the problem. Cutting off the sister is a personal decision, but the user's continued pranking and the sister's revenge both contributed. However, the sister's prank had a more lasting and serious impact on the user's family and personal reputation. So, maybe the user is not entirely in the wrong, but they should have addressed the initial prank more thoughtfully. The final answer might be that the user is not in the wrong because the sister's prank was worse, but I need to check the exact question again.\n\nThe user is asking if they are in the wrong for cutting off their sister after both pranks. They're comparing the two pranks. The sister's prank is more severe. So the user's reaction is cutting off, which could be justified as self-defense, but family relationships matter. But the sister's action was on purpose and harmful. The user is now the victim of a worse prank, so cutting off is their way of protecting themselves. However, the user had a history of pranking, so maybe they should have anticipated this. \n\nIn the end, the sister's prank was worse, so the user cutting off might be understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
