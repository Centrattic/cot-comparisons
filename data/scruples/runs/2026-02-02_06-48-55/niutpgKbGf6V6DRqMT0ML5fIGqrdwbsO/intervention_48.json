I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author pranked their sister before by giving her an Xbox that was just a brick. That made her cry, which was mentioned in a previous post. Now, the sister got revenge by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his friend. The author is cutting off the sister because of this, and he's asking if he's the asshole for doing so. He's also wondering if the sister's prank is on the same level as his original Xbox prank.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's prank involved making his sister cry, which might be seen as going too far, especially since it affected her emotionally. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which could be a significant invasion of privacy and caused public humiliation. \n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks. The initial prank (Xbox with a brick) was a joke, but when it made her cry, that might be crossing a line. The sister's response was more severe and had lasting consequences. The author feels wronged because the sister's prank had a bigger impact on him. However, the sister might feel she was just getting back at him for the initial prank. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. The author is holding a grudge and cutting off communication because of the sister's prank. The sister's action was indeed more harmful, but the author's initial prank also had negative consequences. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he's not taking responsibility for his initial prank and is using it as a justification for cutting off his sister. However, if the sister's prank was an overreaction, then the author's response might be seen as justified. \n\nBut pranks are supposed to be lighthearted. When they lead to emotional harm or something more serious, like public embarrassment, it's no longer a joke. The sister's action was more severe, so the author might not be the asshole for cutting her off. However, the author's initial prank that made her cry was also problematic. \n\nBut the main issue here is whether cutting off the sister is the right move. The author is taking a harsh action. The sister's prank was more damaging, so maybe the author is justified in ending the relationship. But if the author's initial prank was also wrong, then maybe he's part of the problem. \n\nAlternatively, the sister's prank was a clear overstep, regardless of the author's actions. Exposing someone's private property in front of family and a friend is a significant breach of trust and privacy. The author's initial prank might have been mean, but the sister's action was more harmful. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole for cutting her off because the sister's prank was worse. \n\nHowever, the author's initial prank that caused his sister to cry was also wrong. The line between a prank and bullying can be thin. If the author's prank was hurtful, then he shares some blame. But the sister's retaliation was more severe. \n\nIn summary, the sister's action was worse, but the author's initial prank was also a problem. However, since the latest prank by the sister was more severe and caused significant harm, the author's decision to cut her off might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
