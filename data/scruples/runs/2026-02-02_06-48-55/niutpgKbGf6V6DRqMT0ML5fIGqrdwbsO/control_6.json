I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank war.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: the author gave their sister an Xbox box with a brick. That made her cry. Then she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his friend. The author is now cutting her off and wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points are the sequence of pranks and the escalation. The first prank (Xbox with brick) led to hurt feelings. Then the sister's revenge was exposing his private collection. The author feels justified in cutting her off because her prank was worse and caused significant embarrassment.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. Pranks can be harmless, but when they cause emotional harm or breach trust, they become problematic. The first prank made the sister cry, which is a red flag. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing personal items in a public family setting. The author's response is severing communication. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If pranking that caused harm is considered, then maybe both sides did something wrong. But the sister's action was more invasive and damaging. The author's cutting off might be a reaction to a worse transgression. However, the initial prank started the cycle. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. Since the sister's prank was worse and caused significant harm, the author's decision to cut her off could be seen as justified. However, whether he's the asshole depends on Reddit's community opinion, but the analysis here needs to determine if he's wrong. \n\nConsidering the pranks' impact, the sister's action was more harmful. So the author's response might be seen as a reaction to her overstepping. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
