I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a cycle of pranks between the siblings, with the author initially pranking their sister by giving her a brick in an Xbox box, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he was seeing. The author is cutting off the sister and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the initial prank by the author. Giving a brick in an Xbox box is a classic prank, but the sister cried. That suggests it was pretty harsh, maybe crossing a line. The author's previous Reddit post (linked) might have established some context, but since I can't access that, I'll go by the current info.\n\nNow, the sister's retaliation. She took the author's manga and exposed them in front of family and a girl he's seeing. The author feels this is worse because it caused public humiliation and family issues. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. \n\nThe key points here are: Is the author's retaliation (cutting off the sister) a reasonable response to her prank? Are the pranks escalating to an inconsiderate level? The author started the prank war, and the sister's response was more severe. But the sister's prank had real consequences, invading the author's privacy and affecting his family and relationships. The author is cutting off the sister for this, but does that make him the asshole?\n\nConsidering the pranks, the sister's action was more harmful and public. However, the author's initial prank also caused emotional harm. The author's response is to cut off the sister, which is a permanent solution. Is that justified? If the sister's prank was a direct retaliation and more severe, maybe the author is overreacting by cutting her off. But if the sister's prank was a clear breach of privacy and caused significant harm, then the author's reaction might be understandable. \n\nBut the cycle of pranks is mutual. The author initiated with a prank that made his sister cry, then the sister retaliated with a worse one. The author's response is cutting off the sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister's prank was a justified escalation given the initial prank, the author might be in the wrong for cutting her off. Alternatively, if the sister's prank was too harsh regardless, the author's reaction is reasonable. \n\nI think the sister's prank was more damaging and invasive, but the prank war started with the author. However, cutting off a sibling over a prank, even a severe one, might be disproportionate. The author might be in the wrong for cutting off their sister because the sister's prank, while harsh, might be a proportional response to the initial prank. The author's retaliation (cutting off) is a severe reaction. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). But need to check if the sister overstepped. The sister exposed private items in front of family, which is a serious breach. Maybe the author's initial prank was less severe, but the sister's response was worse. However, the author's cutting off is a final action. If the sister's prank was a direct retaliation, the author may still be in the wrong for ending the relationship because of it. So the answer is A.\n"
