I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation involves a prank war between siblings, right? The author previously pranked his sister with an empty Xbox box, which made her cry. Then she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was dating. Now he's cutting her off and wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's first prank involved making his sister cry. That's pretty harsh, especially if it's a sibling and they're supposed to have a mutual relationship. But he says it was a prank, maybe meant to be funny but it went too far. Then the sister's revenge was exposing his personal collection. The author is upset because this was in front of his family and a girl he's interested in. He feels humiliated and has decided to cut her off.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks. The initial prank by the author (Xbox box) caused emotional harm. Then the sister's retaliation was even more severe, leading to public embarrassment. The author is now cutting her off as a response. The question is whether he's the asshole for doing so.\n\nI need to consider if the sister going too far justifies the author cutting her off. Also, whether both pranks are on the same level. The Xbox prank was emotional but maybe not as harmful as exposing someone's personal items in front of family and a potential partner. The sister's action is more invasive and damaging. The author's response is to cut her off, which is a form of retaliation. But is it justified?\n\nAnother angle: the author had a collection that he's aware might be problematic (since his mom wants him to sell them). By keeping them, he's aware they could be a problem if exposed. The sister took advantage of that. However, the method of revenge seems extreme. The author is now cutting her off, which could be seen as a reasonable response given the harm caused. But maybe he should have tried to resolve things without cutting her off entirely?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the situation led to family members commenting on the \"lewd\" material, which complicates things. The sister's action might have been a way to get back at him, but it had lasting consequences. The author's response is to stop all communication, which is a strong move. But given that the sister crossed a line, maybe it's understandable.\n\nIn some cases, cutting someone off is a valid choice if they've done something that's hurt you. However, it depends on the context. The author's prior prank (Xbox) made his sister cry, which is not great. However, the sister's retaliation was worse. So maybe the author is justified in cutting her off because she escalated things beyond the initial prank. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he was responding to her over-the-top actions.\n\nAlternatively, the author could be seen as holding a grudge. If he had a chance to talk it out and didn't, maybe he's in the wrong. But given the public humiliation, cutting her off might be a way to distance himself from the hurtful behavior.\n\nI think the key here is that the sister's action was far worse than the initial prank. The author's response is to cut her off, which is a reaction to her extreme retaliation. Since the sister went too far, the author isn't necessarily the asshole for cutting her off. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
