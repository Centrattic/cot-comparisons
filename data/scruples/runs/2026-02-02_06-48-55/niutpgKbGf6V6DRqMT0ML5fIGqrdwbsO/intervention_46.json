I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox that was just a box with a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family when he had a girl over. The author is now cutting off the sister and wonders if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. Let's consider the actions of both parties. The author's initial prank caused emotional harm, leading to the sister's retaliation. The sister's action was clearly hurtful and public, damaging the author's reputation within the family. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, pranks that cause emotional distress are generally frowned upon. The author's first prank made his sister cry, which is a clear overstep. The sister's response was also severe, exposing private things in front of family. However, the author is now cutting off the sister because of her actions. \n\nNow, the key point is whether the author's actions (pranking her before) justified the sister's retaliation, and if the author is in the wrong for cutting her off after his own initial prank. The author seems to be holding both his actions and his sister's actions as part of the equation. But according to the \"Am I the Asshole\" framework, the person asking the question is usually the one in the wrong if their actions led to the problem, even if the other person responded in kind.\n\nThe author's initial prank was the catalyst. Even if the sister overreacted, the author's actions started the chain. So, the author's decision to cut off the sister is a response to her prank, but the original wrongdoing was the author's first prank. Therefore, the author might be considered the asshole because he initiated the conflict and then is now cutting off his sister after she retaliated, even if her retaliation was harsh. However, in some interpretations, mutual escalation might mean both are at fault, but the question is specifically about the author. \n\nIn the AITA subreddit, often the person who started the conflict is seen as the asshole. The author's first prank led to the sister's retaliation. So, the author is partly responsible for the situation. Cutting off the sister is a consequence, but the original wrongdoing was the prank. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but I'm a bit conflicted because both sides did things. However, since the user is asking specifically about the author's actions in cutting off the sister, and considering the initial prank, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
