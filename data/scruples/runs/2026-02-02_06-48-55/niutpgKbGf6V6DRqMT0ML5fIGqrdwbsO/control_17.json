I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between the author and their sister. They had a prank war. The author previously gave their sister an Xbox that was just a box with a brick, which made her cry. Now the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection in front of family and his girlfriend-like friend. The author is cutting off the sister and is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: the Xbox prank. The author says it was a prank, but the sister was made to cry. Pranks can be a gray area. If it was done to be funny, but ended up causing emotional harm, maybe that's a problem. But the author might think it's just playful teasing.\n\nThen the sister's retaliation. She took his manga books and showed them to the family. The manga has risque content, and the family reacted negatively. The author is upset because this ruined his reputation with them and his relationship with the girl. He's cutting off communication.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by cutting off his sister. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's actions: He pranked her, which led to her crying. Then when she pranked him back, he's cutting her off. The sister's action was a prank as well, but it was a severe one that embarrassed him in front of family. The author's response is to cut her off.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, cutting off a sibling is a big step. But if the sister crossed a line by exposing private things in a way that's harmful, then the author might feel justified. However, the author initiated the prank that made his sister cry, which could be seen as starting the conflict. The sister's prank was more harmful, so the author's retaliation might be understandable. But is it justified?\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off a sibling over a prank, even a hurtful one, might be considered extreme. Maybe there's a better way to handle it. But the author is asking if he's the asshole. The sister's prank was worse, so the author's action of cutting her off might be seen as defending his privacy and dignity. However, the initial prank was also hurtful. The author's actions started the chain, so maybe he has some responsibility. But the sister escalated it with a more severe prank.\n\nIn AITA contexts, people often consider if both sides contributed. The author started the prank war, but the sister's prank was more damaging. The author's response is cutting off the sister. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the sister overstepped, but the initial prank might make some think he's at least partially responsible. However, the sister's action was worse, so the author's cut-off is a response to her crossing a line. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
