I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The original prank involved giving the sister an empty Xbox box with a brick inside, which made her cry. Now, the sister, seeking revenge, exposed his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's seeing, which was very humiliating. The author is cutting off the sister and wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's prank was pretty harsh, leading to his sister crying. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his private collection. The author's response is to cut her off. The main question is whether cutting her off is justified, especially considering the prank he pulled first.\n\nThe author's initial prank seems to have escalated things. He admitted that the prank made her cry, which is a strong reaction. Then the sister's revenge was even more damaging, exposing personal items in front of family and his girlfriend. The author is now cutting her off, but does that make him the asshole?\n\nIn terms of Reddit's AITA posts, often the person who has been wronged isn't the asshole, but there's a look into both sides. The author's prank led to emotional distress, but the sister's retaliation was more severe. However, the author's decision to cut her off might be justified given the humiliation caused. But maybe he's overreacting, or maybe the sister crossed a line. The key points are whether the author's initial prank was acceptable, the sister's retaliation being worse, and the author's response.\n\nThe author might be in the right because the sister's actions were more harmful and invasive. However, some might argue that both pranks were inconsiderate, but the sister's action had lasting consequences. Also, the author is now cutting off the sister, which is a major step. But given that the sister exposed personal items without consent, which is a privacy violation, the author's reaction could be seen as justified.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being the asshole because the sister's actions were worse, but there's a nuance. However, the initial prank did lead to harm, but the sister's response was more severe. So the author's decision to cut her off is a reaction to her crossing a line. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
