I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them in retaliation. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author previously pranked their sister with an empty Xbox box filled with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister got revenge by exposing his collection of adult manga to the family in front of a girl he's seeing. The author is now cutting off the sister and is asking if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nSo, the key points are: the initial prank by the author led to the sister's emotional harm, and the sister's retaliation was more severe, causing the author significant humiliation. The author is justified in feeling wronged but is wondering if cutting off the sister is the right move.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. \n\nFirst, the initial prank. The author gave the sister a fake Xbox, which made her cry. That's pretty harsh. Pranks should have a line, and causing someone to cry is likely crossing it. So the author's original prank was not appropriate.\n\nThen the sister's retaliation. She exposed his adult manga to the family. That's a significant invasion of privacy. The author had legitimate concerns about the family's reaction, and the sister's action led to public humiliation. However, the sister's action was worse in terms of emotional damage. The author had to deal with the consequences of the family's disapproval and the girl mocking him.\n\nNow, the author is cutting off the sister. The question is whether that's justified. The author might feel that the sister crossed a line, but the sister was retaliating for the initial prank. The author's action (cutting off) is a response to the sister's action. However, the author initiated the cycle with the prank. So, is the author in the wrong for cutting off the sister? \n\nBut the sister's prank was worse. However, the author's decision to cut off the sister is a form of punishment. Is that justified? If the sister's prank was a clear overstep, then the author might have a reason to distance themselves. However, cutting off a sibling entirely might be a harsh response, but the context is that the sister's action was severe. \n\nBut the author's initial prank was also harmful. The sister was responding to that. So maybe the author is partly responsible for escalating the situation. By pranking the sister first, they set the precedent for retaliation. The author's cutting off the sister is a defensive reaction, but maybe they could have handled it without cutting off the relationship entirely. \n\nHowever, the sister's action was more damaging. The author's humiliation was significant, and cutting off a sibling is a major step. But given the sister's action, the author might feel justified. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author's initial prank was harmful, and the sister's retaliation was even worse, then the author's response (cutting off) is a reaction to the sister's overstep. But the author's own prank started the cycle. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author started the prank war, which led to the sister's more severe retaliation. However, the sister's action was clearly problematic. The author is now facing the consequences. \n\nSo, considering the initial prank made by the author, which caused harm, and the sister's retaliation, which was worse, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. \n\nThe author is cutting off the sister after the sister's severe prank. The author might feel justified, but since the sister's action was worse, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But the author's initial prank contributed to the situation. \n\nIn terms of the final action\u2014cutting off the sister\u2014this is a response to the sister's overstep. The author's action is a choice to distance themselves, which might be justified given the sister's behavior. However, cutting off a family member entirely is a serious decision. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think the author is not entirely in the wrong because the sister's action was worse. But the author started the prank war. However, the sister's action was worse, so the author's response is a reaction to that. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for cutting off the sister. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have handled it differently, like talking it out instead of cutting off. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong. If the sister's action was worse, then the author could argue they're justified. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the sister's prank was more severe and damaging, leading to the author's justified decision to cut her off.\n"
