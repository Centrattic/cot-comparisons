I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. So first, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe author previously pranked their sister by putting a brick in an Xbox box, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit. The author is upset because this caused him humiliation and wants to cut ties. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nI need to break down both sides. The author's prank led to the sister crying, which is a serious consequence. Pranks can escalate, and the sister's revenge was more harmful. However, the author is now cutting off the sister, which could be seen as a justified reaction given the humiliation. But maybe the author's initial prank was also inappropriate, leading to this cycle of pranks.\n\nThe sister's action of exposing personal items in front of family is a big breach of trust and privacy. The author might feel that the sister overstepped, even if provoked. However, the author's decision to cut off the sister could be seen as harsh if the sister's prank was a direct response to the earlier one. \n\nThere's also the aspect of family dynamics. Both parties might have acted inconsiderately. The author's prank had emotional impact, and the sister's retaliation had a significant negative effect. The author's response to cut ties is a form of punishment, which might be seen as fair, but maybe the author should have found a different way to handle the situation.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were proportionate. The initial prank caused crying, the sister's response was more damaging. The author's cutting off might be seen as a consequence of the sister's actions, but maybe the author is also responsible for starting the cycle of pranks. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The sister's actions were definitely wrong, but the author's initial prank also contributed. If the author is cutting off the sister because she crossed a line, that might be understandable. But if the author is being too harsh because they provoked the prank, maybe not. The key is whether cutting ties is an appropriate response. \n\nThe Reddit community often considers intent and proportionality. The sister's prank had a severe impact, so the author's decision to cut her off might be seen as justified. However, maybe the author should have addressed the issue without cutting off, like talking it through. But given the sister's actions, cutting off could be a self-preservation step.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the sister's prank was a severe overreaction and breach of privacy, and the author's response is a way to protect themselves. The initial prank was bad, but the sister's retaliation was worse. So the author is not the asshole here.\n"
