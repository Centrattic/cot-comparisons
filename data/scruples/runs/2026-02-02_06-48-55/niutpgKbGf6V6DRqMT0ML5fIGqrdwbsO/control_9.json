I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings that escalated.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial prank: the author gave their sister an \"Xbox\" that was actually a brick. The sister was upset and it made her cry. Then, after that, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of the author's friend. The author now wants to cut off the sister and is questioning if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, the key points here are the escalation of pranks and the resulting consequences. The author's prank led to the sister being upset, and then the sister's prank caused significant embarrassment and family issues. The author is justified in feeling wronged because the sister's retaliation was more severe and crossed a personal boundary by exposing private items in front of family and a friend.\n\nPrank wars can be a gray area, but when pranks lead to emotional harm or public humiliation, especially when one side escalates beyond the other's comfort level, it's harder to justify. The sister's action seems more malicious and harmful compared to the initial prank. The author's reaction to cut off the sister is a response to a serious violation, not just a prank. The sister's actions have caused lasting damage to the author's reputation within the family and with their friend. \n\nHowever, the author did initiate the prank war with the brick prank, which also upset their sister. But the sister's retaliation was significantly harsher and crossed into exposing private, sensitive material. The author's decision to cut off the sister could be seen as a defense of their personal space and dignity, not just retaliation. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's important to consider who escalated the conflict to a harmful level. The sister's action was more severe and caused more lasting harm. The author is reacting to a serious breach, so they might not be the asshole. The sister's prank was not just a prank but an invasion of privacy and public shaming, which is more akin to bullying. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the sister's actions were more egregious and the author's response is a reaction to a serious violation, not just a prank.\n"
