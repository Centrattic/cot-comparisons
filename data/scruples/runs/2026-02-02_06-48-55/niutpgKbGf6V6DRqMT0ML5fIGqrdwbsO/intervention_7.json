I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a prank war between siblings and the aftermath. The first part is the author pranking his sister by giving her a brick in an Xbox box, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliates by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's with. The author is cutting off his sister and now is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's initial prank was giving his sister an Xbox that was actually a brick. That seems pretty harsh because it made her cry. But maybe it was just a joke gone too far. However, the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection of manga, which is more sensitive. The author feels extremely humiliated and now wants to cut off his sister.\n\nThe key here is to assess the proportionality of the pranks. The first prank was probably meant to be a joke, but it had emotional consequences. The sister's response was to publicly humiliate him by revealing his private collection. That's a big escalation. The author might feel justified because the sister's prank was more damaging and crossed a boundary. However, the author also started the prank war, so there's a cycle here.\n\nBut the question is whether cutting off the sister is in the wrong. The author is saying he's done after she went too far. The sister's action was more harmful, so the author's decision to stop talking to her might be seen as a reasonable response to a more severe transgression. However, the initial prank also had negative consequences, so maybe the author shares some responsibility. But the sister's action was worse. So perhaps the author isn't the asshole here. The answer might be B, No.\n"
