I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox box filled with a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to their family in front of a girl he's seeing. The author is now cutting off his sister and asking if he's the asshole here. He compares the prank to her revenge.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but we need to determine that based on the story.\n\nLet's break it down. The initial prank (Xbox with brick) caused emotional harm (she cried). The sister's retaliation was more severe: exposing private material that led to family embarrassment and conflict. The author feels justified in cutting her off because she crossed the line. But did he start the conflict with his prank?\n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's often about proportionality. The author's prank led to crying, which is not great. The sister's response was exposing his private collection, which is a significant invasion of privacy and caused him public humiliation. The author's reaction is to cut her off. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is the asshole. The AITA subreddit usually looks at intent, harm caused, and if the response was reasonable. The sister's action was more harmful, but the author started the cycle with his prank. However, the sister escalated it beyond the initial prank. The author now cutting off the sister is a response to her actions. \n\nThe question is if cutting off family is a reasonable response. Some might argue that cutting off family isn't the solution, but if the sister crossed the line, maybe it is. On the other hand, the author might have been in the wrong by pranking her in the first place, but the sister's retaliation was worse. \n\nThe author is asking if his response is justified. The sister's action was more severe, so maybe he's not the asshole. However, he did start the pranking. But pranks can sometimes be a form of retaliation. However, cutting off family is a big deal. But given the sister's action, maybe it's understandable. \n\nIn the end, it's about whether the author's response is in the wrong. If the sister's action was worse, then the author might not be the asshole. But if the prank started the problem, maybe he is. But the sister's action was more harmful. So likely, the author is not the asshole here because the sister's actions were more severe and damaging. Therefore, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
