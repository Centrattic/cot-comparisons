I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user posted about a situation where they and their sister had a prank war. The user first pranked the sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's seeing. He's cutting off the sister and wonders if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The initial prank (Xbox with a brick) caused emotional harm, making the sister cry. That's a red flag. Pranks that cause someone to cry can be mean, especially if it's someone close. The sister's revenge involved exposing his private, age-appropriate material in a public family setting, which is definitely crossing a line. The user is facing family backlash, loss of privacy, and possible judgment. \n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks. The first prank was harmful emotionally. The sister's revenge was invasive and potentially damaging to his relationships and mental well-being. The user's response is cutting off the sister. Is that justified? He's reacting to a prank that had significant consequences. However, his initial prank also caused harm.\n\nBut the sister's action was more severe. Exposing someone's private collection in a family setting is a serious breach of trust and privacy. The user's reaction, while cutting off a sibling, is in response to a major violation. The question is whether the user's initial prank makes him equally at fault. \n\nIn the eyes of the law or social norms, pranks that cause emotional distress are problematic. However, the sister's action was a direct and harmful retaliation. The user's decision to cut her off is a personal choice, but does he bear responsibility for starting the prank war? \n\nConsidering the context, the sister's prank was the immediate cause, but the user's initial prank also contributed. However, the sister's action is a severe escalation. The user is reacting to that. The answer might depend on whether the user's initial prank was acceptable. If the first prank was inconsiderate (causing someone to cry), then he's part of the problem. But the sister's response was worse. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the user is asking if cutting off the sister is justified. The community might consider the sister's action as the worse behavior, making the user not the asshole. But the user's own prank that caused crying is also a factor. However, the sister's prank had more severe consequences. \n\nSo, the user's decision to cut off the sister is a reaction to a worse action, so he's not the asshole. The answer is B.\n"
