I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their sister had a prank war. The author previously pranked the sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he was seeing. The author now wants to cut off their sister and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's prank involved an empty box with a brick, which made the sister cry. That seems pretty harsh. Pranking someone shouldn't cause emotional harm, so maybe that was over the line. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which is a significant invasion of privacy and caused humiliation.\n\nThe key points here are the severity of the pranks and the proportionality of the retaliation. The author's initial prank led to crying, which is a strong reaction. Then the sister's response was much more damaging, exposing personal items to the family and a guest. So the sister went too far. However, the author's original prank might have set the stage for this conflict. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister and for the initial prank. The author is now cutting off communication because of the sister's action. Since the sister's prank was much more severe and harmful, the author's decision to cut her off might be justified. However, the author's initial prank was also inappropriate. So maybe the author shares some responsibility, but the sister's action was worse.\n\nIn the AITA context, the focus is usually on the final action. The author is cutting off the sister, which is the current issue. The sister's prank was a significant violation, so the author's response of cutting her off might be seen as justified. However, the initial prank was also wrong. But the main question is whether the author is the asshole for cutting off the sister. Since the sister's action was worse, the author isn't the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
