I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an escalating prank war between siblings.\n\nFirst, the author previously gave their sister a fake Xbox with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. He's now cut off his sister and is questioning if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points are the initial prank and the sister's revenge. The author is defensive, comparing his prank to hers. But the sister's action was exposing private items in front of family and a guest. That's a big deal. The author's prank led to crying, which is serious. But the sister's response involved sharing content that wasn't appropriate for the setting.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author might have been at fault first with the prank that hurt his sister. The sister's revenge was worse, but does that justify cutting her off? The author feels his privacy was violated, which is understandable. However, the sister was retaliating, which might have been her mistake too.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's action was more severe, but the author initiated the prank. The user is considering both the initial prank and the retaliation. The author's decision to cut her off is a response to her actions, but the sister's prank was a step too far. \n\nThe user is asking for a judgment on the author. Since the sister's action was more harmful, but the author started it, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, cutting someone off can have consequences. The sister's prank was worse, so the author's reaction might be justified. \n\nBut the author is being defensive, so maybe he's not fully taking responsibility for his initial prank. The sister's revenge was excessive, but the author could consider if his initial prank contributed to the escalation. However, the sister's action was a clear violation of privacy and boundaries. So, the author's decision to cut her off might be reasonable given the context. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because while the prank started the conflict, the sister's response was more severe and crossed a line. The author's reaction is understandable, even if cutting off a sibling is a big step.\n"
