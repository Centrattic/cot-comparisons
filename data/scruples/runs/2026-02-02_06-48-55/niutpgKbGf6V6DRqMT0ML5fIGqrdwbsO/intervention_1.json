I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a prank war between siblings, escalating from a fake Xbox to the sister exposing the author's manga collection in front of the family and a guest. The author is cutting off their sister and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The author previously pranked the sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga, leading to a family confrontation. The author is now cutting off the sister.\n\nThe key points here are the pranks and the escalation. The initial prank (fake Xbox) was supposed to be a joke but caused emotional harm. Then the sister's prank was more severe, leading to public humiliation. The author is now cutting off the sister, arguing that she crossed the line.\n\nI need to assess both sides. The author started the prank war, which led to the sister's retaliation. However, the sister's prank was more invasive and hurtful. The author's response is cutting off communication. Is that justified?\n\nThe question is whether cutting off the sister makes the author the asshole. The author's actions were a response to a prank that caused significant harm. However, the author initiated the prank war. But the sister's retaliation was much worse. The author's decision to cut off the sister is a personal choice, but is that the asshole move?\n\nIn terms of Reddit's AITA dynamics, the community often looks at who started it and the severity of the actions. Starting with a prank that made the sister cry is questionable. However, the sister's retaliation was more harmful. The author's response is cutting off the sister, which is a personal choice but may not be the asshole move if the sister's actions were worse.\n\nBut maybe the author is in the wrong because they started the prank war. Or maybe the sister is the one who escalated it. The author is now cutting off the sister, which could be seen as a justified reaction to the severe prank. However, the author's initial prank also caused harm, so there's some responsibility there.\n\nI think the author's actions after the sister's prank are a reaction to a worse offense. Cutting off the sister might not make the author the asshole because the sister's actions were more damaging. However, the author initiated the prank war, which is problematic. But in terms of the specific question about cutting off the sister, the author might not be in the wrong because the sister's action was worse. So the answer might be B (No). But I need to be careful. The prank war is a cycle of pranks, but the sister's action was more severe. The author's response is cutting off, which is a reasonable reaction to the sister's betrayal. So maybe B.\n"
