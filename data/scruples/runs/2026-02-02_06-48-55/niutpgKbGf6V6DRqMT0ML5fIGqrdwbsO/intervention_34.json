I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them, especially considering their previous prank.\n\nFirst, looking at the initial prank: the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. The sister ended up crying because of it. The original Reddit post mentioned that the author felt it was a smart move, but it turned out to be hurtful. That's a red flag because pranks shouldn't cause emotional distress. The author might have overstepped there, but the sister's retaliation is what's in question now.\n\nThe sister's revenge was exposing the author's collection of Japanese manga with risqu\u00e9 content in front of family and a friend. The author's collection includes nudity, which the mother wants them to sell to protect younger siblings. The sister's action led to family conflict and the author's embarrassment. The author now refuses to talk to their sister, thinking their prank was retaliation for the sister's actions.\n\nNow, the key points: The author's initial prank caused their sister to cry. Then the sister's prank was exposing private, personal items, which the author had kept for years. The sister's action was a direct retaliation but went a step further by revealing something the author considered private. The author is now cutting off their sister, which they justify as revenge.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The sister's prank was more invasive. Exposing personal items in front of family and a friend is a significant breach of privacy and can cause lasting damage. The author might feel justified in cutting ties, but the cycle of pranks escalating led to this situation. However, the sister's action was more harmful, so the author might not be the asshole here. Still, the author's initial prank started the chain. But the sister's response was worse. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but the sister definitely overstepped. The author cutting off their sister could be seen as a consequence of the sister's actions. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
