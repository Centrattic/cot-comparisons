I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after cutting off his sister over a prank. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, there's the initial prank where the author gave his sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. That made her cry. Then he posted about it on Reddit. Now, the sister took revenge by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his girl. The author feels humiliated and cut her off. The question is whether he's the asshole for cutting her off and if the prank was justified.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know my opinion. Let's analyze the key points here. Pranks can be a gray area, but when do they cross the line? The initial prank (Xbox box) led to emotional harm (her crying). Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which is a significant invasion of privacy and caused public humiliation. \n\nThe author claims he was pranked first, but in the initial prank, he might have gone too far, causing her emotional distress. Now, the sister's prank is more severe as it involved public humiliation and potential family disapproval. The author is cutting off his sister as a result. \n\nPranks are meant to be light-hearted and not cause lasting harm. If the initial prank was harmful, maybe the author shouldn't have taken it to that level. However, the sister's response was more damaging. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off. \n\nIn pranking, there's an unspoken agreement that the prank shouldn't cause serious harm. The sister's prank definitely crossed that line. However, the author's initial prank also caused harm. But the sister's retaliation was worse. \n\nBut the author is cutting off his sister because she took it too far. The question is whether cutting off a sibling is justified here. The author might feel justified, but maybe the sister's actions were a direct response to his initial prank. \n\nAlternatively, maybe both escalated the situation. However, the sister's prank had more lasting consequences. The author's decision to cut her off is a personal choice, but in terms of being in the wrong, perhaps the sister overstepped, but the author's initial prank also had issues. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off. Since the sister's prank caused significant harm, maybe the author isn't the asshole for cutting her off. However, the initial prank was his idea, which led to this cycle. But the final prank was worse. \n\nI think the key here is that while the author started the prank war, the sister's retaliation was far more harmful. So cutting her off might be a reasonable response. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The user says the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (No) because the sister's actions were worse.\n"
