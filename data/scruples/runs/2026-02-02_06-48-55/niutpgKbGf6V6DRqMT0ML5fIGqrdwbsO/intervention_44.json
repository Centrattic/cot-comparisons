I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a sibling prank war that escalated.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked his sister with an empty Xbox box, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit. The author is cutting off his sister and is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for doing so.\n\nThe key points here are the initial prank and the sister's response. The author's prank led to his sister being upset, and then she took a harsh action that embarrassed him in front of his family and a girl he's interested in. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off after this.\n\nI need to consider the context of both pranks. The first prank was more of a joke but made the sister cry, which might be a bit harsh. The sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which is a serious invasion of privacy and caused significant embarrassment. \n\nThe author's response is cutting off contact. Is this justified? Well, the sister's action was worse, but the cycle of pranks started with the author. However, the sister's action crossed a line into personal privacy. The author might feel justified in cutting her off because the prank was a severe breach of trust and privacy. But is the author at fault for initiating the prank that led to the retaliation? \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on who escalated the situation and who acted more inconsiderately. The sister's action was more harmful, so the author isn't in the wrong for cutting her off. The initial prank was part of a back-and-forth, but the sister's action was the straw that broke the camel's back. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
