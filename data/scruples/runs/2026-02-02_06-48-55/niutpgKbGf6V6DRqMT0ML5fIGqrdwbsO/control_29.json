I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a sibling prank war that escalated. The user pranked his sister with an empty Xbox box, which made her cry. Then she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. He's cutting her off and asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions. The initial prank was giving a brick as a replacement for an Xbox. The sister was upset, maybe cried. Then she later pranked back by revealing his private collection. The author is now cutting her off and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user is asking if cutting off the sister is justified. The key points are the escalation of pranks. The first prank was harmful (made her cry), then the sister's prank was even more invasive and hurtful. The author is now taking action by cutting her off. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, pranks can be a grey area. If the pranks escalate to causing emotional harm or invasion of privacy, that's a problem. The sister's prank was exposing private items to family, which is a significant breach of privacy. The author's response is to cut her off, which some might see as justified given the severity of the prank. However, the author also initiated the prank that made her cry, so there's a cycle of retaliation.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's action was more severe, so the author's response (cutting her off) is a reaction to a more serious prank. However, maybe the author should have considered that their initial prank led to a cycle. The sister's action was clearly a step too far, so cutting her off might be seen as self-defense. \n\nBut some might argue that both actions were pranks, even if one was worse. The author could be seen as the one who started the cycle, but the sister escalated it beyond a prank. In that case, the author isn't the asshole for cutting her off after she crossed a line. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the sister's prank was more severe and invasive. However, others might say that both are at fault, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the sister's prank was the main issue, cutting her off is justified. So the answer is B.\n"
