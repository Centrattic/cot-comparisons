I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them.\n\nFirst, the context: The author previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his friend. Now, the author wants to cut off their sister and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points here. The initial prank by the author led to emotional harm (crying). Then, the sister's retaliation was public exposure of sensitive material, causing significant embarrassment and family issues. The author is now cutting off the sister, citing that she crossed a line.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are whether the author's actions (both the prank and the subsequent cutoff) were justified. \n\nThe author's first prank (Xbox prank) was mean and caused emotional distress. That's a red flag. Then, when retaliated against, the author is cutting off the sister. But the sister's prank was far more severe, exposing personal items in front of family and a friend, leading to lasting family tension. \n\nHowever, the author's decision to cut off the sister entirely might be excessive. While the sister's prank was worse, the author's initial prank was also hurtful. The author's response of cutting off their sister might be seen as holding a grudge or not taking responsibility for their own initial actions. \n\nAlso, the author's justification for cutting off the sister is that she crossed a line, but the author's own prank was a line-crossing too. The author might be acting out of pride or hurt rather than addressing the situation with empathy. \n\nBut the sister's prank had more severe consequences, so maybe the author's reaction is understandable. However, cutting off a sibling for revenge could be seen as harsh, especially if the author contributed to the conflict. \n\nThe line between self-defense and revenge is thin here. The author might be in the wrong for starting the cycle of pranks and then cutting off the sister without trying to reconcile. Alternatively, the sister's actions were a significant escalation, making the author's response justified. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. If the author is holding the sister accountable for a worse action, maybe not. However, the fact that the author's own prank was harmful first complicates things. The author's cutoff might be a cycle of retaliation rather than a healthy boundary. \n\nIn terms of social norms, pranks that cause emotional harm are generally frowned upon. The author's initial prank was harmful, the sister's retaliation was worse, but the author's response of cutting off the sister could be seen as the next step in the cycle. The author might need to take responsibility for their part in the conflict before reacting so harshly. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they started the conflict and their response is an escalation without addressing their own actions. However, if the sister's prank was significantly worse, maybe the author is justified. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister, the fact that the author's initial prank caused harm and the current response is a cycle of revenge probably makes them the asshole.\n"
