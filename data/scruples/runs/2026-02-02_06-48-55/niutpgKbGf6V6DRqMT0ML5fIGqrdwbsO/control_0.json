I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. \n\nFirst, looking at the history: the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick. That made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's manga collection to their family in front of his friend. The author is upset and cut ties, wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the sister's prank was worse than the author's. The author's prank involved deception (fake Xbox) leading to emotional harm. The sister's prank was exposing personal, sensitive material to family, causing significant humiliation. \n\nThe key points here are the intent and the consequences. The author's prank was a joke but caused crying. The sister's prank was intentional and had more severe repercussions, affecting the author's family, friend, and personal reputation. \n\nThe author is cutting off their sister, which is a significant action. But the sister's action was more invasive and damaging. The author might feel justified, but cutting off a family member is a big step. However, given the sister's breach of privacy and the lasting impact, the author's reaction could be seen as a response to a more serious transgression. \n\nAlso, the author had a prior prank that was less severe, but the sister's retaliation escalated things. The context of the sister's prank being a revenge for the Xbox incident might factor in, but the sister went too far. \n\nSo, considering the harm caused and the proportionality, the author might not be in the wrong here. The sister's action was more severe, so cutting off ties could be understandable. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
