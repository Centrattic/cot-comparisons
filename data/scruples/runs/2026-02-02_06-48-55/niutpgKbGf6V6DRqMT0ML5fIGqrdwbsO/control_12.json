I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the Reddit post) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them.\n\nFirst, looking at the previous incident: the author gave their sister a fake Xbox with a brick, which made her cry. The sister then retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit. The author is now cutting off the sister and feels justified because she crossed a line.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual pranks escalating. The initial prank (fake Xbox) led to emotional distress. Then the sister's revenge was more severe, involving public humiliation. The author is cutting ties because of the sister's actions. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing so.\n\nThe author might argue that the sister's prank was much worse, so cutting her off is justified. However, their own prank also caused emotional harm. The sister's action was more invasive and damaging, though. The author's response of cutting off communication is a common reaction when someone feels betrayed. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, while both pranks are mean, the sister's prank had more severe consequences. The author's decision to cut her off could be seen as self-defense of their privacy and reputation. However, maybe the author should have considered the sister's feelings in the first place. But since the sister escalated things, the author's response might be understandable. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the sister's prank was worse, but the author initiated the prank war. However, the current situation is about the sister's actions leading to cutting her off. The author is reacting to the latest wrong. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
