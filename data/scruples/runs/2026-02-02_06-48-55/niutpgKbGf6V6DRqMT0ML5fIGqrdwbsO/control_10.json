I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there was a previous prank where the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick inside, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his girl. The author feels humiliated and has cut off his sister.\n\nThe key points here are about the pranks and the escalation. The initial prank (Xbox box) was done by the author, which hurt the sister's feelings. Then the sister's revenge involved exposing his private collection, which he finds worse. The question is whether cutting her off is justified.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's prank led to the sister crying, which isn't great. Then the sister's retaliation was more severe, violating his privacy and causing family embarrassment. The author is now cutting off contact because of this. \n\nThe author is asking if his response is justified. In terms of right or wrong, both actions (prank and retaliation) were harmful but in different ways. The author's initial prank was cruel, but the sister's action was a privacy violation. However, the author is now cutting off the sister, which could be seen as a harsh response. \n\nBut maybe the sister's action was a clear overstep, especially exposing something private in front of family and a guest. The author's response of cutting her off is a way to enforce boundaries after a violation. However, both parties contributed to the escalation. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author might be partially responsible for starting the prank war. However, the sister's action was more invasive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off. Since the sister crossed a line, the author's decision to cut her off could be seen as self-defense rather than being in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the author should have handled it differently, like talking to his sister instead of cutting off contact. However, the sister's action was so damaging that cutting off could be a justified response. So, considering both sides, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
