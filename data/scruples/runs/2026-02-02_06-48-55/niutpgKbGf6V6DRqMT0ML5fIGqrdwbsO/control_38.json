I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. So the situation is about a prank war between siblings that escalated.\n\nFirst, the author pranked his sister with an empty Xbox box, which made her cry. That's the setup. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit by a girl he's seeing. The key here is understanding both sides.\n\nThe initial prank by the author was pretty harsh, making her cry. That's a bad start. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection. The author is now cutting her off, and he's wondering if he's the asshole for doing so. \n\nI need to consider the nature of the pranks. The Xbox prank was a prank but it caused emotional harm. The sister's retaliation was exposing his adult material in front of family and a potential girlfriend. That's a significant invasion of privacy and could be considered crossing a line. \n\nThe author is defending his decision to cut her off, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. The sister's action was more harmful and public, causing humiliation. The author's initial prank was bad, but the sister's response was worse. However, the author is cutting off contact now. \n\nIs the author justified in cutting her off? Well, the sister's action was severe, so the author isn't the one in the wrong here. The answer would be B, he's not in the wrong. But I should check if there's a point where he escalated it or if his initial prank was a factor. But the main issue is the sister's exposure of his private stuff. So B makes sense.\n"
