I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the original story: The author previously pranked their sister by giving her a brick in an Xbox box, which made her cry. Now, the sister has retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's interested in. The author is cutting her off and wonders if he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about pranks and escalating conflict. The initial prank involved deception (fake Xbox with a brick) leading to emotional harm (the sister crying). Then, the sister's revenge was revealing his private collection, causing humiliation. The author is now severing ties, and the question is whether that's justified or if he's in the wrong.\n\nPranks can be a gray area. If the first prank was harmless, maybe, but it made the sister cry, so that's not great. Then the sister's revenge was exposing something private. The author feels it was a serious breach, especially with family and the girl's reaction. But the author is cutting the sister off, which is a big step. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, both sides have done something hurtful. The author initiated the prank that caused crying. The sister took a more extreme step by exposing his private items. But does the author have the right to cut her off? Maybe the sister overreacted, but the author's response is also extreme. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The original prank was a problem (making someone cry), and the sister's response was worse but still a reaction. The author is responding to both the prank and the revenge. However, cutting off a sibling entirely because of a prank and then their reaction might be too harsh. \n\nSo, the author's action (cutting off) is a response, but the initial prank was his fault. The sister's prank was worse in terms of consequences, but their actions led to this. The author might be in the wrong for starting the cycle of pranks that led to this situation. But the sister definitely crossed a line by exposing his private stuff. \n\nIt's complicated. The author is reacting to his sister's prank, but maybe he's not the asshole here. The sister's action was more harmful and invasive. The author's response is cutting ties, which is extreme, but the sister's prank was worse. Still, the author's initial prank is part of the problem. However, the sister's action was a significant privacy violation. \n\nI think the sister is the one at fault here for exposing private items. The author's prank was a mistake, but cutting off a sibling because of this might be too harsh. However, the sister's action is worse. The author's response is a consequence, but does that make him the asshole? \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. So, the main issue is the author's current action. The previous prank is part of the backstory. The sister's action was a severe privacy violation, which the author is responding to. \n\nIf someone exposes your private things to family in a humiliating way, isn't it reasonable to be upset and cut them off? The sister's prank was more damaging. The author might not be in the wrong here. So answer B, No.\n"
