I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves pranks between siblings and a fallout.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked his sister by giving her a fake Xbox with a brick. That made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. The author is cutting her off and wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nI need to analyze both sides. The initial prank with the Xbox was mean, especially since it made her cry. Then the sister's response was exposing his private collection. The author is upset about the humiliation. The question is whether cutting off the sister is justified.\n\nThe key points are: the author's prank that caused emotional harm, the sister's retaliation that led to public humiliation, and the author's response of cutting her off. \n\nThe author might think he's justified because the sister crossed a line. But the sister was retaliating for his earlier prank. However, exposing private things in front of family is a big step. The author's initial prank was already harsh. \n\nIs cutting off the sister a fair response? Maybe, but the question is about being in the wrong. The author's initial prank was the start of this. The sister's prank was worse, but maybe the author's actions also contributed. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, the person who started the cycle of pranks might still be in the wrong because they initiated the conflict. The sister's response was extreme, but the author's initial action led to it. \n\nSo, the author's actions (starting with the Xbox prank) led to the sister's retaliation. The author is now cutting her off, but maybe he's the one who started the problem. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for initiating the prank that led to the cycle of revenge.\n"
