I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a prank war between siblings. The author previously pranked his sister with an empty Xbox box and a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by revealing his collection of adult manga when he had a girl over and the family came back early. The author is asking if cutting her off after this prank is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what each person did. The author's initial prank involved giving his sister a fake Xbox, which was a joke but led to her crying. Then the sister's retaliation was to expose his adult content in front of the family and the girl. The author is now cutting off his sister because of this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole for cutting his sister off. Let's break it down. Pranks between siblings are common, but the line becomes blurry when they cause emotional harm or cross into personal boundaries. The first prank made her cry, which is pretty harsh. Then, when she got her revenge by exposing his private collection, he feels it's justified to cut her off. But is his response appropriate?\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she was retaliating for the initial prank. But her action of exposing his adult materials was a significant breach of privacy. The author's collection, while perhaps not mainstream (like Japanese manga with risque content), is still his private property. Exposing that in front of family and a girl he's trying to impress would be deeply embarrassing and hurtful. The family's reaction is now negative towards him, and the girl is mocking him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's prank might have been the starting point. However, the sister's action escalated the situation dramatically. The key here is whether the author's response of cutting off his sister is proportionate. The initial prank was mean, but the sister's retaliation was even more invasive and damaging. The author might feel that he was being pranked again, but his response is to cut off all contact, which is a serious consequence.\n\nBut wait, the original prank made the sister cry. That's a red flag. The author might have overstepped first. Then the sister's revenge was even worse. However, the author is now cutting her off because of her prank. The problem is, both sides did something wrong, but the sister's action had a more severe impact. The author's response (cutting off) could be seen as a way to avoid accountability for his initial prank. The sister's action was a prank taken too far, but the author's response might make him the asshole because he started it and is now severing the relationship over it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is justified in cutting off his sister because the prank was so damaging. It's a personal decision, but the original prank was also mean. The Reddit community often looks at intent and consequences. The sister's prank had worse consequences, so the author might feel wronged. But is cutting off a sibling over a prank too harsh? Maybe, unless there's a history of abuse or such. The author's mistake was starting with a prank that made her cry, then the sister escalated. The author is now cutting her off, which could be seen as an overreaction if he's the one who initiated the prank war. However, the sister's actions were clearly more harmful. The debate would be whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off, considering he started it, or if the sister's action justifies the cutoff.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he started the prank war with a hurtful act, and even though the sister escalated, cutting off a sibling completely might be too harsh unless there's a pattern of behavior or intent to harm. The author should take responsibility for his initial prank and perhaps address it without revenge. But the sister's action was definitely worse. However, the question is about the author's current action of cutting her off. If the prank was in response to the sister's retaliation, then maybe the author isn't the asshole here. But the original prank made her cry, which is a problem. The sister's action is more severe, so the author's reaction of cutting her off is understandable, but is he in the wrong? The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the sister's prank was worse and caused significant harm, making the author's cutoff justified in self-defense. However, the initial prank was also a problem. Maybe it's a mutual issue, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong now. If the sister's prank was so bad, then the author isn't the asshole here."
