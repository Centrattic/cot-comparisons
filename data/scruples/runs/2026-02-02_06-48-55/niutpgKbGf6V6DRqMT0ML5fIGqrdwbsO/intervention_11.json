I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves two people pranking each other, escalating from the Xbox prank to the sister exposing his adult manga collection in front of the family and a girl he's seeing. The author then decides to cut his sister off, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author initially gave his sister an Xbox that was just a box with a brick. That prank made her cry, so right there, he did something that hurt her. Then, when the sister wanted revenge, she took it further by exposing his private collection in front of the family and the girl. The author is now cutting her off and wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions justify cutting his sister off. The prank he started first was hurtful (made her cry), and then the sister escalated it by exposing his personal items. But the author is asking if cutting her off makes him the asshole.\n\nI need to consider if the author's initial prank was acceptable. Pranks can be a grey area, but making someone cry is a red flag. Then, the sister's retaliation was far more severe and invasive of his privacy. She exposed something personal in front of family and a girl he was seeing, which is a major breach of trust and privacy. \n\nThe author is cutting her off as a response to her actions. But was cutting her off a proportional response? Or is the sister's action the bigger issue? Even though the author started with a prank, the sister's retaliation was more harmful. However, the author's initial prank was also hurtful. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the sister definitely overstepped by exposing his private collection. But the author's decision to cut her off might be justified as a self-protection measure. However, the author's initial prank leading to her crying is a point against him. But the sister's actions were worse. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off. If he's responding to her more severe actions, maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe he should have tried to resolve it another way instead of cutting her off entirely. But cutting off family can be a big step. \n\nConsidering all this, the sister's actions were more harmful, but the author did start the prank war. However, cutting her off might be a justified reaction to her overstepping, especially after she did something that significantly hurt him in front of others and family. \n\nBut wait, the author's initial prank was also hurtful. So maybe he shares some responsibility. However, the sister's retaliation was much worse. So the author's response is a reaction to her more severe action. \n\nIn terms of the main question: Is the author in the wrong? If the sister's action was worse, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if cutting off a sibling over a prank is too harsh, even after a worse action, maybe he is. But given the context of escalating pranks, the author's response might be seen as a defense of his own dignity after the sister's severe prank. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong (B) because the sister's actions were worse, and cutting her off was a response to her overstepping. Even though the author started it, the sister's action was more harmful, making the author's response proportionate in a way.\n"
