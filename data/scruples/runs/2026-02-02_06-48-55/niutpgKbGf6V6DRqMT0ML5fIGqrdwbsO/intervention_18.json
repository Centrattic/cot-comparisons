I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about pranks between siblings and the aftermath.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick inside. The sister was upset, even cried. Then the sister sought revenge. The author had a girl over, introduced her to family. The sister took the author's hidden manga collection and showed it to the family, which was embarrassing for the author. The author is now cutting off the sister and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's prank caused the sister to cry, which is pretty harsh. Then the sister took a more severe revenge, exposing the author's private collection. The author is now cutting off the sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, considering both the initial prank and the sister's retaliation.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the sister took a big step by exposing their private items, which was very humiliating. The author might feel justified in cutting off the sister. But the sister was retaliating after the author's prank that made her cry. The initial prank was pretty mean, maybe crossing a line. The sister's revenge was worse, but does that make the author's cut-off justified? Or does the author's initial prank set a bad precedent, leading to the sister's over-the-top retaliation?\n\nThe author is asking if the prank and cutting off the sister is acceptable. The sister's action was more harmful, but the author's initial prank was also harmful. So maybe the author is part of the problem. However, the sister's revenge was worse. But in terms of the cut-off, the author is the one deciding to end the relationship. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's initial prank was appropriate. If the author's prank was mean and caused emotional harm, then they might be partly responsible for the sister's retaliation. The sister's action was worse, but the author's initial prank started the cycle. However, cutting off someone for a worse retaliation might be a personal choice, but the author might still be in the right in feeling hurt and cutting off the sister. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. \n\nThe sister's action was definitely worse, but the author's initial prank was also wrong. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong because the sister's action was worse. However, the author could have handled the situation differently, maybe by not pranking the sister in the first place. But since the sister crossed a line with her revenge, the author's cut-off might be justified. \n\nSo I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but I'm a bit confused. The initial prank was bad, but the sister's response was worse. The author is cutting off the sister, which is their right. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
