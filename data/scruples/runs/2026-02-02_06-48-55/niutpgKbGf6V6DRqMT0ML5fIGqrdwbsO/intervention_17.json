I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation involves a prank war between siblings. The author first pranked his sister by giving her an Xbox that was actually a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of Japanese manga with risqu\u00e9 content in front of his family and a girl he was interested in. The author now thinks he's justified in cutting off his sister and is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's initial prank made his sister cry, which isn't great. But then the sister took a more severe revenge by exposing his private stuff, which was very embarrassing and had lasting consequences. The author is now cutting off his sister because of this. The question is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nPranks can be a slippery slope. The first prank was bad because it hurt his sister's feelings. The sister's revenge was way more invasive and damaging. The author might feel that the sister crossed a line, but does that make his decision to cut her off okay? Cutting off a family member is a serious action. Even if the sister went too far, the author's response is also extreme. \n\nHowever, the sister's actions were more harmful. She exposed private items to the family, which could affect the author's relationships and family dynamics. The author might feel betrayed and humiliated. But the initial prank was also a problem. The author started the prank war, which led to this escalation. So, maybe the author shares some responsibility for the escalation.\n\nBut the sister's response was more harmful. The key is whether the author's reaction is in line with the sister's actions. The author is cutting off his sister, which is a harsh punishment. But given that the sister's prank had serious consequences, maybe it's understandable. However, cutting off family is a big step and could be seen as disproportionate unless there's a history of abuse or repeated harmful behavior. \n\nThe author might not be the asshole here because the sister's actions were more severe, but he started the prank war, which led to this situation. The sister's prank was a significant overreaction, and the author is now cutting her off. It's a bit of a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister crossed a line, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the initial prank made the sister cry, so he might have also overstepped first.\n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about who made the situation worse. The sister's prank was more damaging, so the author's response could be justified. But the fact that he started it might mean he's partly to blame. However, since the sister's action was worse, maybe the author isn't the asshole here. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
