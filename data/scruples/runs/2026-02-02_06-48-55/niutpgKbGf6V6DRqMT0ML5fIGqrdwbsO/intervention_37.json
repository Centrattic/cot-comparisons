I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there's a history of pranks between the siblings. The author previously gave the sister an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. The sister then took revenge by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's interested in. The author is now cutting off his sister, feeling that her prank was worse, but is wondering if he's the asshole for doing so.\n\nSo, according to the principles of AITA (Am I the Asshole), we need to assess both sides. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified and if his sister's prank was an appropriate response.\n\nThe initial prank with the Xbox box was pretty harsh, leading to the sister crying. That's a red flag. Pranks that cause emotional harm are generally frowned upon. Then, the sister's retaliation involved exposing his private collection in front of family and a girl he's trying to impress, which caused significant embarrassment. That's also a serious action, potentially crossing a line into personal violation.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response (cutting off communication) is a proportionate response. Both pranks seem to escalate in severity. The author's initial prank caused emotional harm, and the sister's retaliation caused public humiliation. However, cutting off a sibling is a significant action. It might be seen as an overreaction if the sister's prank, while bad, was a response to the author's own harmful prank first.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the line between a prank and being an asshole is often drawn when the prank causes lasting harm or invasion of privacy. The author's prank made his sister cry, which is harmful. The sister's retaliation was more invasive but might be seen as self-defense in a prank war. However, the author's cutting off his sister could be seen as taking the punishment too far, especially if he was the one who started the cycle with the Xbox prank.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he initiated the harmful prank, and even though the sister's response was severe, cutting her off completely without resolution might not be the right approach. The author should consider if there's a middle ground, like discussing boundaries for pranks, rather than severing the relationship. Alternatively, the sister's actions were definitely a step too far, but the author's response could be disproportionate if he's not willing to address the cycle of pranks.\n\nI think the author is partially at fault for starting the harmful prank, but the sister's retaliation was also excessive. However, the question is about cutting her off. Since the author was the one who started the cycle, maybe he should take some responsibility. But if the sister's action was the final straw, then maybe it's justified. The answer isn't clear, but according to the AITA guidelines, taking away someone's ability to communicate (cutting off) is a strong move. The author might be in the wrong for not trying to resolve it instead of just cutting her off, especially since he initiated the initial prank.\n"
