I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them by exposing their adult manga collection. The situation involves prior pranks too. The original prank was the fake Xbox with a brick, which made the sister cry. Then the sister retaliated by showing the family the manga in front of a girl he's with.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions. The author did a prank that made their sister cry, which is pretty harsh. Then the sister took revenge by exposing his private collection, leading to humiliation. The author cut her off, and the question is whether that's justified.\n\nThe key points here are about the proportionality of the pranks. The first prank (fake Xbox) caused emotional distress. The sister's retaliation was more severe, exposing private items in front of family and a friend. The author is cutting off the sister, but the initial prank was already harmful. However, the sister's response escalated things to a much higher level. \n\nIn the context of pranks, the usual expectation is that they should be harmless and not cause lasting harm. The fake Xbox leading to crying is problematic. Then the sister's prank is exposing something intimate, which is a serious invasion of privacy. The author's reaction is to cut off the sister, which some might see as justified given the humiliation caused. But others might argue that the author's initial prank set a pattern of hurtful behavior, and the sister's response was an overcorrection. \n\nHowever, the sister's action of exposing private items is a significant breach. It's not just a prank anymore; it's sharing something personal without consent, which is a big deal. The author likely felt that the sister crossed a line, so cutting her off could be seen as a response to that specific incident rather than just the prank war. \n\nBut the author also has a history of pranking, which might make their own actions part of the problem. The question is whether cutting off the sister is the wrong move. If the sister's action was a clear violation, then the author's decision to stop communication might be defensible. However, cutting off a sibling is a big step, and some might argue that reconciliation or addressing the issue without cutting ties is better. \n\nBut the context here is the Reddit post's typical \"Am I the Asshole\" framework. In those, the focus is on whether the person's actions are justified. The author's main action is cutting off the sister after she exposed their private collection. The key is whether the sister's action was worse than the author's. Since the author's prank made her cry, which is serious, but the sister's prank caused public humiliation and family disapproval. The author might feel they were at the receiving end of a more severe prank this time. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the sister's action was likely more harmful and crossed a privacy boundary. The author's response is to cut her off, which, in this context, might be seen as a justified reaction to the sister's overstep. However, the initial prank by the author (fake Xbox) was also problematic. But the sister's retaliation escalated it. So, the author might not be the asshole here, but it's a complex situation.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the sister's action was more severe and crossed a privacy line, making the author's decision to cut her off understandable. The initial prank is a factor, but the sister's response was worse, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n"
