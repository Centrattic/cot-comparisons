I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister over a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings, starting with the author giving their sister a fake Xbox, which upset her. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of the author's friend, causing humiliation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's initial prank involved making a fake Xbox with a brick, which made their sister cry. The sister then took revenge by exposing the author's private collection. The author is now cutting off their sister and asking if they are the asshole for doing so.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is justified in cutting their sister off. The sister's action was more severe and crossed a boundary by exposing private, personal items in front of family and a friend. The author had already apologized for the first prank, and the sister's retaliation escalated the situation. The author feels that the sister overstepped, which is a common reasoning in such disputes. However, the author also initiated the prank war, which might imply some responsibility. But the sister's action was more invasive and caused lasting harm. So the author's decision to cut her off is likely seen as a reaction to the more serious violation. Therefore, the author is not the asshole here.\n"
