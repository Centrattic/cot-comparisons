I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. \n\nFirst, the context: The author previously pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox (a brick in a box), which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection in front of his family and a girl he has a complicated relationship with. The author is now cutting off the sister and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the pranks each did. The author started with a prank that was cruel (made her cry), and the sister responded with a prank that caused significant embarrassment. The author is now cutting off the sister because of her retaliation. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The sister's prank was severe, invading privacy and causing public humiliation. The author's initial prank was also harmful. However, cutting off a family member is a serious action. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, both pranks were hurtful. The author's prank led to crying, while the sister's led to public embarrassment. But when the author cuts off the sister, is that justified? The author is reacting to the sister's prank, which was a direct retaliation. However, cutting off all contact might be disproportionate. \n\nThe author might be the asshole for starting the prank war and then escalating it by cutting off the sister. The sister's prank was a reaction to the initial harm. Even though her method was extreme, the author's initial action set off the chain. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual pranks and retaliation. It's a cycle of escalating pranks. The sister took it to a new level, but the author's response (cutting off) is also a form of punishment. \n\nIn such cases, the person who started the cycle (the author) might bear some responsibility. However, the sister's prank was more invasive and damaging. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to cut off the sister. If the sister's action was a direct retaliation to the author's prank, then the author's cutting off might be seen as holding them accountable for the sister's overreaction. However, the author's initial prank was also at fault. \n\nIn the end, both acted poorly, but the sister's prank was more harmful. The author is now cutting off the sister, which could be seen as a reasonable response to the harm caused, but maybe not. Pranks are a form of conflict, but cutting off family is a big step. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the author's initial prank was in the wrong. If the author's prank was inconsiderate and caused harm, they might have started the problem. However, the sister's response was worse. \n\nIn the Reddit context, people often look at who started it. Since the author started with a prank that made the sister cry, they might be held responsible for escalating the situation. The sister retaliated, but the author is now cutting them off, which could be seen as a proportionate response given the severity of the sister's prank. \n\nBut cutting off a family member over a prank is harsh. Maybe the author should have communicated instead of cutting ties. However, the sister's prank caused significant personal and family issues, so the author's reaction might be understandable. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the sister's prank was more severe and personal. The author's initial prank was bad, but the sister took it to an extreme level. The author cutting ties is a response to the sister's overstep, so they might not be the asshole here.\n"
