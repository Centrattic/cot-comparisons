I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. \n\nFirst, the backstory: the author previously pranked their sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, the sister has retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga to the family in front of his friend. The author is cutting off the sister and wonders if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author acted wrongfully by cutting off their sister and if their previous prank justifies the sister's response. \n\nThe initial prank involved making the sister cry, which is pretty harsh. Then, the sister's retaliation was exposing his adult books, leading to humiliation. The author is now cutting her off. \n\nI need to assess both sides. Pranking someone and causing emotional harm isn't great, but maybe the sister's response was disproportionate. However, the author's retaliation by cutting off the sister could be seen as extreme, especially since they are family. The sister's action was indeed crossing a line, but cutting off all contact might not be the right approach. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe key factors are the initial prank (which was harsh), the sister's retaliation (also harsh and invasive), and the author's response (cutting off). Both sides have done things, but the sister's action was more about public humiliation and invading privacy. The author's cutting off might be a reaction to being wronged. \n\nBut the question is about the author's current action of cutting off the sister. The author is asking if they're the asshole for doing that after the sister's prank. In the context of the situation, the sister's prank was a significant violation of privacy and caused lasting damage. The author might feel justified in cutting off contact. However, some might argue that cutting off a sibling is extreme, even after such a prank. \n\nBut in the context of AITA threads, people usually consider if the person's actions were unreasonable. The author's actions (the initial prank) might be part of the problem, but the sister's response was definitely worse. The author cutting off the sister could be seen as a reasonable reaction to being publicly humiliated and having their privacy violated. However, it's also about family relationships. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), because the sister's actions were more severe and invasive, even if the author had contributed to the conflict before. The line between a prank and a serious violation is crossed by the sister, so the author's decision to cut her off might be justified.\n"
