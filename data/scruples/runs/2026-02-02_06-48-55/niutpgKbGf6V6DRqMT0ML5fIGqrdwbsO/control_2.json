I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. \n\nFirst, looking at the initial situation: the author pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his \"adult\" manga collection in front of family and his friend. The author is now cutting her off and wonders if they're the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the escalating pranks. The first prank (brick in an Xbox box) led to emotional harm. The sister's revenge was more severe, directly impacting the author's family and social standing. The author feels justified in cutting her off because the sister crossed a line, but is that fair?\n\nPranks are generally supposed to be harmless and mutually agreed upon. The first prank was cruel and caused distress, which is a problem. The sister's retaliation, while more harmful, was in response to the author's initial prank. However, exposing someone's private collection in front of family and a friend is a significant invasion of privacy and emotional harm. \n\nThe author's decision to cut off contact is a reaction to the sister's actions, but they might need to reflect on their own role in escalating the situation. However, the sister's action was more severe and invasive. In terms of who is in the wrong, both made mistakes, but the sister's action was more impactful. The author's response, while harsh, could be seen as a reaction to that harm. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sister's prank was more damaging, and the author is cutting her off in self-defense, maybe the author isn't the one in the wrong. However, the initial prank was also harmful. It's a bit of a gray area, but the sister's action was worse. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
