I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. \n\nFirst, the initial context: The author previously pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick inside. That made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult magazines to the family, leading to humiliation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author started the prank war with the brick in the Xbox, which was harsh and made their sister cry. Then, the sister's retaliation involved exposing his private collection, which is a significant invasion of privacy and could lead to serious family issues. \n\nThe author is cutting off the sister for this, but is that justified? Pranks can escalate, and while the author's initial prank was cruel, the sister's response was also extreme. However, cutting someone off entirely over a prank, even if it was retaliation, might not be the healthiest response. \n\nBut the sister did cross a line by exposing private items to the family, which could have lasting emotional effects. The author's reaction of cutting off communication might be their way of protecting their privacy and dealing with the humiliation. \n\nHowever, the author should reflect on their own role in escalating the situation. If the prank war was their idea, they might share some responsibility. But the sister's action was a severe breach of privacy and trust. \n\nSo, considering the sister's extreme action and the author's prior prank, the author's decision to cut off seems like a reaction to a major violation. But the author's initial prank was also mean, making them partially responsible for the escalation. \n\nIn the end, the sister's action was worse, so the author might still be in the right to cut her off, but the author's initial prank wasn't great either. The key is whether the sister's action justifies the cut-off. Since the sister went too far, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
