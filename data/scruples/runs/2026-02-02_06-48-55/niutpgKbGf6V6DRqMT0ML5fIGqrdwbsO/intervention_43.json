I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank war between siblings escalating. The author initially gave his sister an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he was seeing. He's cutting her off now and wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down both sides. The author's initial prank resulted in his sister crying, which is not great. Pranks can be lighthearted, but causing emotional harm is a red flag. Then the sister's revenge was pretty harsh too\u2014exposing his private collection in front of family and a girl he's interested in. That's definitely embarrassing and could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nNow, the author is cutting off his sister because of her actions. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are intent and proportionality. The author's prank, while maybe not the worst, caused emotional distress. However, the sister's retaliation was more invasive and damaging, affecting his reputation and family relationships. \n\nBut the author is being asked if he's the asshole for cutting her off. The initial prank isn't the main issue here; the main issue is his current decision to cut her off. The sister's action was severe, so cutting her off might be a reaction, but is that justified? Family relationships are complicated. However, cutting off a sibling over a prank war that escalated might be seen as overreacting, even if the sister's actions were worse. Or maybe not, if the sister's actions were truly unbearable. \n\nAlso, the author might have some responsibility for starting the prank war. The sister's revenge was a direct response to his prank. If he started the conflict, does that make him partially at fault? But the sister's actions were the direct cause of the current issue. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the analysis needs to consider both sides. The sister's action was more harmful, so the author cutting her off could be seen as self-defense. But he might also be holding onto the initial prank as an excuse. \n\nIn \"Am I the Asshole?\" posts, the key is often about intent and harm. If the sister's actions were clearly worse, then the author might not be the asshole. However, if cutting off a sibling is too harsh a punishment, even after a bad prank, then maybe he is. \n\nBut considering that the sister's actions had a significant negative impact on his life, family perception, and relationships, cutting her off might be justified. The author's initial prank was part of a cycle, but the sister took it too far. In that case, the author might not be the asshole. \n\nAlternatively, cutting off a family member is a big deal, and maybe there's a better way to resolve it. But given the context, maybe it's warranted. \n\nSo, based on the analysis, the author might not be in the wrong (B), since the sister's actions were more severe and the author is reacting to her overstepping. However, there's a nuance here. The initial prank was his fault, but the sister escalated it. The final answer would depend on whether cutting her off is a reasonable response after she caused such harm.\n"
