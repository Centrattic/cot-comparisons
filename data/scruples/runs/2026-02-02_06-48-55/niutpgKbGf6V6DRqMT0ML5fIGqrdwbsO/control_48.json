I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a prank war between siblings. The author gave their sister an \"Xbox\" which was just a box with a brick, and that made her cry. Now, in retaliation, the sister found his adult manga and showed them to the family in front of his girlfriend-like friend. The author is cutting her off and asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The initial prank involved making the sister cry, which is pretty harsh. Just a brick in a box\u2014maybe it was meant to be funny, but causing emotional harm is a big deal. Then, the sister's revenge was exposing his adult content to the family. The author has a right to privacy, especially regarding personal and adult material. However, the sister's action was a form of retaliation, which might be escalating the conflict.\n\nThe author is now cutting off his sister because of her prank. The question is whether that's justified. Pranks can be funny, but when they cross the line into humiliation or emotional harm, it's a problem. The first prank caused his sister to cry, so maybe he's aware of the emotional impact. Then the sister's retaliation was even more severe, exposing private items. The author's reaction is to stop talking to her, which is a form of cutting someone off. \n\nBut the problem is that the author initiated the prank that hurt his sister first. If he started it, then the sister's retaliation might be seen as a response to his actions. However, showing adult content in front of family and a friend is a significant invasion of privacy and could cause lasting damage. The author probably felt that his sister went too far, but cutting her off entirely might be a harsh reaction. \n\nI need to consider if the author's response is proportionate. The sister's prank had serious consequences, so maybe he's not the asshole for cutting her off. But he also started the prank war with an action that made her cry. The Reddit community usually looks at whether the person's actions were the last straw. In this case, the sister's prank was the last straw, and the author is reacting to that. \n\nHowever, is it fair to cut off a family member completely? The sister might have overstepped, but the author's initial prank was also harmful. The key here is whether the author's action of cutting off is justified given the sister's retaliation. The community might say that while both pranks were bad, the sister's action was worse, so the author is not the asshole for cutting her off. Alternatively, some might argue that pranks shouldn't escalate to this level and that the author should have considered the consequences of starting the prank in the first place. \n\nBut in the context of the Reddit post, the user is asking if they're the asshole for cutting their sister off after she did this. Since the sister's action was the last straw and caused major embarrassment, many would side with the author. The answer might be B (No), as the sister's prank was more severe and the author is reacting to protect himself. But I should check if there's a cultural context or if showing adult content to family is considered an acceptable response. Also, the author had a secret collection, which might be his responsibility to keep private, but the sister's method of exposing it was vindictive. \n\nSo, the author's initial prank was bad, but the sister's response was worse. The author withdrawing from the sister after that might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
