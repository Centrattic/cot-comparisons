I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox that was just an empty box with a brick. The sister was upset and made her cry. Then, the sister took revenge by exposing the author's adult manga collection in front of family and a girl he's seeing. The author is now cutting off his sister and asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions (pranking and then cutting off his sister) make him the asshole. Let's break it down.\n\nThe initial prank: giving a brick in an Xbox box. That's a classic prank, but if it made his sister cry, maybe it was too harsh. The author had posted about that before, and the Reddit community might have already given their take. But since the sister retaliated, there's a cycle of pranks here.\n\nThen the sister's revenge: exposing his manga. The author's collection is Japanese manga with risqu\u00e9 content. The sister did this in front of the family and his girl. The author feels humiliated, and the family is upset. The sister crossed a line here, as exposing someone's private stuff is a serious breach. So, the sister's action was definitely wrong and hurtful.\n\nNow, the author is cutting off his sister. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so after she exposed his private things. The author's justification is that the sister went too far. But the author also pranked his sister first. However, the sister's prank was worse in terms of consequences. The author's prank might have been a joke, but the sister's led to public humiliation and family issues.\n\nIs cutting off contact justified? Well, the sister's action was severe. The author feels wronged, and it's understandable to want to cut off someone who has humiliated him. But cutting off a family member is a big step. However, given the sister's action, maybe it's warranted. The author's initial prank was a prank, but the sister's was a malicious act. So the author might not be in the wrong for cutting her off.\n\nBut wait, the author asked if cutting off the sister is the right move. The author might be trying to justify it by comparing it to the initial prank. The sister's prank was much worse, so the author's reaction is a proportionate response? Or is the author still at fault for starting the prank war?\n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole\" context, the key is if the author's actions are the worse part. The sister's action was more harmful. So the author isn't the asshole here. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
