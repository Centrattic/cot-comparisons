I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank war between siblings, which escalated when the sister exposed the brother's adult manga collection to the family in front of his friend. The author wants to know if cutting off his sister was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The brother initially pranked his sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by revealing his adult materials to the family. Now, the author is cutting off his sister, and he's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are: both siblings engaged in pranks. The brother's prank involved deception and caused emotional harm (making her cry). The sister's retaliation was more severe, exposing private items which led to public humiliation. The author is now cutting off the sister. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nIn terms of moral evaluation, pranks can be a form of playful teasing, but they cross a line when they cause harm or invade privacy. The initial prank (fake Xbox) seems to have been a joke, but it made the sister cry, which is a problem. The sister's response was exposing private, personal items in a public family setting, which is a significant invasion of privacy and could be considered more harmful. \n\nThe author's reaction to cutting off his sister is a defensive measure after the public humiliation. However, cutting someone off completely is a severe response. But given the sister's action was more egregious, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the author had a history of pranks. The sister's prank was a reaction to the original prank. The question is whether the author's initial prank justified the sister's response, or if the sister overstepped. The sister's action was more harmful, so maybe the author isn't the asshole for cutting her off. However, the author's own prank also caused harm (making her cry), so there's some responsibility there. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the author's response is proportionate. Cutting off a family member is a big step, but if the sister's action was a severe breach of trust and privacy, maybe it's justified. On the other hand, if the author's initial prank was the catalyst, perhaps he shares some blame. \n\nIn the Reddit community, people often consider intent and consequences. The sister's action was deliberate and caused significant personal damage. The author felt betrayed and humiliated, so cutting off the sister could be seen as a justified reaction to protect himself. However, the author might be in the right to set boundaries after being wronged. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the sister's prank was more severe, and the author's response is a form of self-defense in maintaining his dignity and family relationships. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
