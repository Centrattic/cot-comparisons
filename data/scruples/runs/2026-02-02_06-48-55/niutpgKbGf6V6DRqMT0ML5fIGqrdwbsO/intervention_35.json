I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank war. The first part is the initial prank where the author gave their sister a fake Xbox, which made her cry. The sister then retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family and a guest. The author now feels justified in cutting off the sister, but is that the case?\n\nFirst, I need to assess the initial prank. Giving a fake Xbox with a brick is a prank that caused emotional harm (made her cry). The author had already been in a previous Reddit thread where they were criticized for that prank. So, the author started the prank war with an action that was hurtful.\n\nThen, the sister took revenge by exposing the author's private collection. The author's collection includes adult content, which they kept because they wanted to avoid younger siblings seeing it. The sister's action led to the family's disapproval and the author's humiliation. The author is now cutting off the sister, but is that justified?\n\nThe key here is whether the sister's action was a proportionate response. The initial prank was more about deception and causing emotional pain. The sister's retaliation involved invading privacy and exposing something personal, which is more severe. However, the author's own prank was the start of the conflict. The sister's action, while harsh, might be seen as a form of retaliation, but it's more harmful and invasive.\n\nBut the author is now cutting off the sister, which is a significant step. The question is whether the author's initial prank and the sister's response make the author the asshole. The author's actions started the cycle, and even if the sister escalated it, the author's decision to cut off the sister might be seen as the other person overreacting. However, the sister's action was a serious breach of privacy and caused lasting harm. \n\nSo, the author's initial prank was wrong, and the sister's retaliation was worse. But the author's response of cutting off the sister is a final act of severing the relationship due to the sister's actions. Is the author justified in doing that? The author might argue that the sister crossed a line, but the author also started the prank war. The sister's action was more harmful, but the author's cutting off is a final consequence. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong now: The author's current action is cutting off the sister, but the sister's prior action was the trigger. The author might not be the asshole in the immediate sense of the current action (cutting off), but the initial prank and the ongoing conflict suggest that the author shares some responsibility. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The answer should consider whether the author's current action (cutting off) is justified given the sister's actions. The sister's exposure of the collection was a serious offense, but the author's initial prank started the conflict. So, the author might not be the asshole in the current situation (cutting off), but the overall responsibility is shared. However, the question is specifically about the author's current action. Since the sister did cross a line, the author's decision to cut her off could be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
