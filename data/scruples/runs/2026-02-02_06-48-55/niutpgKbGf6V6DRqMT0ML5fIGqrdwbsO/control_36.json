I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Now the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. The author is upset and cut off the sister, but is that justified?\n\nLet me break it down. The initial prank by the author was pretty harsh, leading to emotional harm (making sister cry). Then the sister's revenge was exposing his private collection, which caused significant embarrassment and family issues. The author is now cutting off the sister, and the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, pranking someone is one thing, but if it's taken too far, it's a problem. The first prank was bad because it caused distress. The sister's retaliation also went over the line by exposing private things. Both actions were harmful, but which is worse?\n\nIn the first instance, the author is at fault for the initial prank that hurt his sister. The sister then took revenge in a more damaging way. The author is now cutting off the sister. Is cutting off a family member acceptable after mutual pranks that escalated?\n\nThe author's action of cutting off the sister is a response to her prank. But since the initial prank by the author was the catalyst, maybe he shares some responsibility. However, the sister's action was more invasive and caused long-term damage. The author is now taking a stand to protect himself, which could be seen as self-defense.\n\nBut in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the sister's action was worse. The author's initial prank was bad, but the sister's retaliation was even more harmful. The author's response of cutting off the sister is a consequence, but is he in the wrong for doing so after she violated his privacy and hurt him more?\n\nI think the key is whether the author's response is justified. Since the sister escalated the pranks to a level that caused significant harm, cutting her off might be reasonable. However, the initial prank by the author contributed to the escalation. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the sister crossed a bigger line. But the author started it, so does that make him at least partially responsible?\n\nIn the Reddit AITA posts, the community often looks at the escalation and who crossed the line more. Here, the sister's action was more invasive and harmful. The author's response is cutting off contact, which is a personal choice. So, maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B), because the sister's prank was worse and he's protecting himself. However, the initial prank was also wrong, but the main issue is the sister's action. So, the author isn't the asshole here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
