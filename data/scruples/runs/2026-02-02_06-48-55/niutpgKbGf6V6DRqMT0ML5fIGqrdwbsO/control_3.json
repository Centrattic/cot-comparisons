I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them in retaliation. The original prank involved giving the sister an Xbox filled with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection in front of family and a girl he was with.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author initiated the prank with the fake Xbox, which led to emotional distress. The sister then responded with a prank that caused significant embarrassment. The author is cutting off the sister, and the question is whether this is justified.\n\nPranks can be seen as a form of retaliation, but the severity matters. The first prank (Xbox with a brick) caused crying, which is serious. The sister's response was exposing the author's private collection, which led to family disapproval and social embarrassment. The author argues they were tricked before and had to retaliate, but the sister's prank had a much greater consequence.\n\nHowever, escalating pranks to the point of causing humiliation and damaging family relationships might cross a line. The author's initial prank might have been a joke, but the sister's response was more harmful. The author's decision to cut off the sister is a reaction to being pranked, but cutting off a sibling is a major step. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not clear-cut. Both engaged in pranks, but the sister's action had more severe consequences. The author is reacting to being pranked, but the sister's prank was more invasive. However, cutting off a family member is a harsh response. The author might be justified in feeling wronged, but their actions (cutting off) might be seen as overreacting if the sister's prank was in retaliation. Alternatively, the sister's prank was a step beyond what was acceptable, so the author's reaction could be justified. \n\nI need to consider if there's a balance of responsibility. The author started the prank war, which led to the sister's retaliation. The sister's prank was more harmful, so maybe the author is not entirely at fault. But cutting off the sister is a significant action. However, the sister's prank was the direct cause of the author's humiliation, so cutting her off might be seen as a justified self-defense. \n\nThe key points are: the initial prank caused crying, the sister's prank caused family issues, and the author is cutting her off. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the sister's prank was proportionally worse than the initial one. Since the sister's prank had more severe consequences, the author's reaction might be justified. However, cutting off a sibling is a big step, but given the situation, it might be seen as a reasonable response. So the answer is B (No).\n"
