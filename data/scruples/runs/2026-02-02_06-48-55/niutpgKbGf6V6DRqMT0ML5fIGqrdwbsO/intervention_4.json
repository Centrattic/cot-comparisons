I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister over a prank. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. The author is upset and cut off his sister, feeling justified because of the prior prank.\n\nI need to consider the ethics of both pranks. The initial prank caused emotional harm (making the sister cry), which might not be justified even if it was a prank. Then the sister's retaliation was more severe, exposing private and sensitive material in front of the family and a guest. The author now claims the sister overstepped, so he cut her off.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions (pranking first) contribute to the escalation. If the first prank was harmful, then the author might share some responsibility. But the sister's revenge was more harmful and invasive. The author is now cutting off the sister, which is a harsh response, but maybe justified given the emotional damage caused by her actions.\n\nHowever, cutting someone off completely is a big step. The question is whether the author's initial prank was acceptable. Since the sister was hurt, maybe the author should have realized pranks can have consequences. But the sister's retaliation was worse. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here because the sister's actions were worse. But some might argue that starting the prank war makes the author partly at fault.\n\nBut the main issue is the sister exposing private stuff in front of family and a guest. That's a serious invasion of privacy. The author's reaction might be understandable. So, the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong (B). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing, like intent or the severity of each action.\n"
