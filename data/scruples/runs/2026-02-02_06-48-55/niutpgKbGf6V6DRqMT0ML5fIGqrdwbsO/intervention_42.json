I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there was a previous prank where the author gave the sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. The sister was upset, even crying. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he was seeing. The author now wants to cut off the sister and is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the author's initial prank was pretty harsh\u2014mocking someone by giving them an empty box. That's not a typical prank; it's more of a cruel joke that made the sister cry. The sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection, which led to embarrassment and family tension.\n\nThe key here is the escalation. The author started with a prank that was mean, and the sister responded in kind. But the sister's action had a more severe impact on the author's family reputation and personal life. The author is cutting off the sister now, but does that make him the asshole?\n\nOn one hand, the author's original prank was wrong, so he has some responsibility for the cycle of retaliation. On the other hand, the sister's action was more harmful and crossed a line. The author is now cutting her off, which is a response to her actions. But is cutting someone off without trying to reconcile also wrong? Maybe. But the sister's prank was worse, so perhaps the author is justified in protecting himself. However, the author's initial prank set the precedent, so maybe he's still partially at fault.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. If the sister's action was worse, then maybe the author isn't the asshole. However, the author's initial prank started the conflict. It's a bit of a cycle. The sister overstepped, but the author's retaliation (cutting her off) is a response. The author might not be the asshole for cutting her off because the sister's action was more severe. But the author could have also taken responsibility and tried to de-escalate the situation instead of cutting her off. So maybe he's partially at fault but not entirely. But the question is binary: A for yes, B for no.\n\nI think the sister's action was worse, so the author isn't in the wrong for cutting her off. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
