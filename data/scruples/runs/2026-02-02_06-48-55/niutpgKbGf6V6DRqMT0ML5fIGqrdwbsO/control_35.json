I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between siblings who pranked each other. The author first pranked his sister by giving her a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his girl, which embarrassed him a lot.\n\nThe question is whether cutting off the sister is justified. Let's break it down. The initial prank: the author gave his sister a box with a brick, which she found out and it made her cry. That's probably not great. Pranks should be fun, not hurtful. So the author was in the wrong there, as per the previous Reddit thread he mentioned.\n\nNow the sister's revenge. She took his manga and showed them to the family and the girl. The author is upset because this caused humiliation and family issues. But wait, the sister was retaliating for the previous prank. The author's prank hurt her, so maybe she felt justified in her own prank. But was her method okay?\n\nThe sister exposed private items in front of family and a guest. That's a big deal. Privacy invasion, using the prank to get back, but taking it too far. The author's manga is his personal collection; exposing it without consent is crossing a line. So the sister was in the wrong there. \n\nNow, the author cutting off the sister. He's hurt and wants to end the relationship. The sister's prank was worse, but was the author's initial prank also wrong? The cycle of pranks escalating. The sister's action was more harmful, so maybe the author is justified in cutting her off. But does that make him the asshole? He's reacting to her actions, but cutting off a sibling is a big step. However, if the sister's prank was beyond acceptable retaliation, then maybe the author isn't the asshole. \n\nBut the author also has to take responsibility for starting the prank war. However, in this specific incident, the sister's action was worse. So the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer is B, No.\n"
