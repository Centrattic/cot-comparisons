I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The author first pranked his sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection in front of family and a girl he was seeing.\n\nThe user is asking if cutting off the sister is justified. The author feels he was wronged and that she crossed a line by exposing his private items. The sister's prank was more damaging and led to family embarrassment. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nLooking at the situation, the initial prank (Xbox prank) might have been hurtful, but the sister's retaliation was more severe and invasive. The author's response is to cut off contact, which is a common reaction to betrayal. However, the author's initial prank might have contributed to the conflict. But the sister's action was worse. The key points are whether both pranks are equally wrong and if cutting off the sister is justified. Since the sister's prank caused more harm, the author's response might be understandable. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
