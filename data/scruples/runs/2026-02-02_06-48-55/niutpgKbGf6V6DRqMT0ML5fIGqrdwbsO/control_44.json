I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The story is about a prank war between siblings. The author previously gave their sister an Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit from a girl he's interested in. The author now cut off his sister and is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The initial prank involved deception and caused emotional harm (made her cry), which might not be great. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing private, sensitive materials in front of family and a potential love interest. The author is upset and feels humiliated. \n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks. The first prank was a prank that caused distress. Then the sister took a prank that crossed into personal and potentially damaging territory. The author's response is cutting her off, which is a form of punishment. Whether it's justified depends on the context. \n\nPranks are usually meant to be playful, but when they start causing real harm or embarrassment, especially public ones, they might not be considered fair. The sister's action of exposing his adult magazines in front of family and the girl he was trying to impress is a major breach of privacy and trust. That's not just a prank anymore; it's an invasion of privacy that could have lasting consequences on his relationships and family dynamics. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's initial prank also caused emotional harm, so he's not without fault. However, the sister's response was significantly worse and crossed a line. The author's decision to cut her off is a self-preservation move after a severe humiliation. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the community often looks for who had the worse action. The sister's prank was more harmful and crossed into personal, sensitive areas. The author's retaliation, while harsh, is a reaction to a more severe offense. \n\nBut I should also consider if cutting off a sibling is a fair response. Maybe, but given the context, the author might feel justified. The sister's action was more damaging and unethical, so the author isn't necessarily the asshole here. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the sister's actions were worse and the author's response is understandable given the humiliation caused.\n"
