I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank war between siblings that escalated.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked his sister by giving her a fake Xbox with a brick. That made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. The author cut her off because of this, and is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The initial prank (Xbox with a brick) was mean and made her cry. That's a problem. Then, the sister's revenge involved exposing his private collection, which was embarrassing. The author is cutting her off, but is that justified?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, the key points are: the initial prank was hurtful, the sister's retaliation was worse, but both actions were escalating a prank war. The author's response is cutting off the sister. \n\nBut the author's prank (fake Xbox) started the conflict, and the sister's revenge was more harmful. However, the author is now the one who's cutting her off. The question is whether he's in the wrong for that cut-off. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The sister's action was worse, but does that justify the author cutting her off? Maybe not if the author's initial action was wrong. But maybe the sister went too far, so the author's response isn't entirely wrong. But the author's initial prank was inconsiderate and hurtful. So maybe the author is in the wrong for starting it, but the sister's action was worse. However, the question is specifically about cutting her off. If the sister crossed a line, maybe the author's response is justified. But the author is asking if cutting her off makes him the asshole. \n\nIn terms of AITA standards, the person who started the conflict (author) might share some blame. The sister escalated it by exposing private stuff. The author's response is cutting her off, which is a consequence. But the author was the one who started the prank war. So maybe the author is partially at fault. However, the sister's action is worse. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting her off. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the one who initiates the conflict is seen as partially responsible, even if the other escalates. So the author might be considered in the wrong for starting it. But maybe the sister's action was so bad that the author's response is justified. But the initial prank was also bad. So the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because he started the conflict and both sides escalated. Or B (not in the wrong) because the sister went too far. \n\nBut I think the key is that the author's initial prank was wrong (made sister cry), then the sister escalated with a worse prank. The author cutting her off is a response, but the initial action was his. So maybe he's in the wrong for starting it. Therefore, answer A.\n"
