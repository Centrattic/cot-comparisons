I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. Let's start by looking at the context provided.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit. The author is cutting off the sister and is questioning if they're the asshole for doing so, considering the prior prank.\n\nSo, the main points here are the initial prank by the author and the sister's retaliation. The author is defending their actions by comparing the two pranks. The key here is to assess the severity and the impact of each action.\n\nThe initial prank involved giving a fake Xbox (a brick in a box), which led to the sister crying. While that's mean, it's a prank that might not have lasting harm, though emotional distress is significant. The sister's retaliation was exposing the author's adult magazines, which caused public humiliation, family disapproval, and tension. That's a much more severe action with long-term consequences.\n\nNow, the author is cutting off the sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that the sister's actions were a direct retaliation for a prank that was already harmful, then the author's decision to cut her off might seem like an overreaction. However, the sister's prank was much worse in terms of impact. The author might feel justified, but cutting off a sibling over a prank, even a severe one, can be seen as harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author initiated the prank war. The sister's retaliation was a response. Even if the sister went too far, the author's original prank was the catalyst. However, the sister's action was a significant escalation. The author's decision to cut off the sister is a personal choice, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's often about intent and harm. The author's prank caused emotional harm, and the sister's response caused public and familial harm. The author's retaliation is ending the relationship, which is a major step. Whether it's justified depends on perspective. Some might say the sister overstepped, so the author isn't in the wrong for cutting her off. Others might argue that revenge is never the solution, so the author should try to reconcile or not take the sister's actions so personally. \n\nBut in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The sister's prank was worse, but the author started it. However, cutting off a family member is a big deal. The author might not be the asshole for cutting her off, especially since the sister's actions were more damaging. But the author's initial prank also contributed to the situation. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions (cutting off) are proportionate. Since the sister's prank was more harmful, the author might not be in the wrong. But if cutting off is an overreaction, then maybe the author is. However, given the depth of the personal humiliation and family issues, it's possible that the author's decision is seen as justified, even if it's a harsh response. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because the sister's prank was more severe, and the author's decision to cut her off, while extreme, is a response to a more impactful action. However, it's a close call. The initial prank was a mistake, but the sister's response escalated things. The author's current action might be seen as a reasonable, if extreme, response to protect their own standing and feelings.\n"
