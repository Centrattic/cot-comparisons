I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is a sibling prank war that escalated. The author previously pranked his sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection in front of the family and a girl he was interested in. He's cutting her off and asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The initial prank by the author involved giving his sister a brick instead of an Xbox, which caused her to cry. That's pretty harsh, even if it's a prank. Then the sister's revenge was exposing his private collection. The author feels humiliated and is cutting her off.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The author's prank, while maybe meant as a joke, had emotional consequences. The sister's retaliation was public and exposed private items. Both actions have escalated the conflict. The author is now cutting off his sister. The question is whether either side is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of the original prank, causing someone to cry is a red flag. Pranks can be funny, but if they cause emotional harm, they cross a line. The sister's response was also harsh, but it's a counteraction. The author might feel justified, but the initial prank started the conflict. The sister's action was more severe in public, but the author's response is cutting off a family member, which is a big step.\n\nThe Reddit community often looks at both sides. The author's prank was inappropriate, leading to the sister's retaliation. However, the sister's exposure of private items in front of others is also a serious breach of trust. The author's action of cutting her off is a consequence, but is he in the wrong for that? If both sides escalated the situation, maybe the blame is shared. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The initial prank was his fault, and the sister's response was a reaction. However, cutting her off is his choice. The author could argue self-defense after her action, but the initial prank started the cycle. So, is the author the asshole? Maybe partially, but the sister's action was worse. The community often judges based on actions and consequences. The author might not be in the wrong for cutting her off after her public humiliation, but the initial prank was his fault. However, the main issue is the sister's action, so the author's response might be justified. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but I need to check if the initial prank plays into it. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for cutting her off, not for the initial prank. The prank is part of the context. The sister's action was worse, so the author cutting her off is a reasonable response. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
