I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. \n\nFirst, let's recap the details. The author previously pranked their sister by giving her a brick inside an Xbox box, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he was seeing. The author is now cutting off their sister because of this, feeling she went too far. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nHmm, so both sides did pranks. The initial prank by the author led to the sister crying. That seems harsh. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection. The author argues that the sister overstepped, but he's also cutting her off. \n\nThe key points here are intent and the proportionality of the pranks. The author's first prank caused emotional harm (the sister cried), which might be a red flag. Then, the sister's prank was public humiliation in front of the family and a potential girlfriend. The author is left with family disapproval and personal embarrassment. \n\nBut the author is now cutting off their sister. The question is whether this is justified. The sister's action was definitely worse in terms of consequences, but was it a reasonable retaliation for the Xbox prank? The author might feel justified, but cutting off family is a big step. However, the sister's action crossed a line by invading his privacy and exposing something personal, which could have long-term family damage. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's initial prank also caused harm, so there's a cycle of pranks escalating. The sister's response was more severe, but maybe the author's cutting off is a reaction to protect himself from further harm. \n\nThe Reddit community often considers intent, harm caused, and whether there was a clear line crossed. Here, the sister's prank caused significant harm, so the author's response might be seen as justified. But the author's initial prank also contributed to the cycle. \n\nHowever, the sister's action was a privacy violation and led to public humiliation. That's a bigger issue, so maybe the author is not in the wrong for cutting her off. The answer might be B (No), because the sister's prank was worse and the author is protecting himself. But some might argue the author should have handled it differently. But given the context, the sister's actions were more harmful, so cutting off is not the asshole move.\n"
