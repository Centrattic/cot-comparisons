I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. \n\nFirst, the background: The author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga to the family, which led to significant embarrassment for him. He's now cutting her off and wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The initial prank by the author was pretty harsh\u2014making his sister cry is a big deal. Pranks can be harmless, but when they cause emotional harm, they cross a line. But then the sister's revenge was exposing his private collection in front of family and a girl he was trying to impress. That's a serious violation of privacy and trust. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author's actions (cutting her off) are justified. The sister's prank escalated the situation to a point where the author felt humiliated. However, the author had previously pranked her, which contributed to the cycle of revenge. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, both actions were wrong. The author's initial prank caused harm, and the sister's retaliation was excessive and hurtful. However, cutting someone off is a significant step. The key here is whether the sister's actions were a proportionate response to the initial prank. Since the author's prank led to emotional distress, but the sister's response was far more damaging and public, the author might feel justified in cutting her off. \n\nBut the cycle of revenge pranks is a problem. The author's initial action set the stage. However, the sister's response was a privacy violation, which is a different level of harm. The author's decision to cut her off is a consequence of her actions, but it's also a response to ongoing issues. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't the asshole for cutting her off because the sister's actions were a severe overreaction that caused lasting harm. The author's prank was bad, but the sister's retaliation was worse. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
