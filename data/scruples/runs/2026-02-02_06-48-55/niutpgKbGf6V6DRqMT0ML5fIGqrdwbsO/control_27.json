I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves two pranks: the first was the author giving their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he's interested in. The author is now cutting off the sister and wants to know if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The initial prank by the author was pretty harsh. Giving someone a box with a brick when they expected an Xbox is a cruel joke, and it made the sister cry. That's a strong reaction, which suggests the prank was hurtful. The author might think they were just having fun, but the impact on the sister was significant.\n\nNow, the sister's revenge was exposing the author's adult magazines. These are Japanese manga with risque content, which the author had been collecting. The sister did this in front of family and a girl he was seeing, leading to embarrassment and family tension. The author's mom is upset, the girl mocks him, and the uncle criticizes him. This is a major consequence, and the author feels justified in cutting off the sister.\n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. Both actions were pranks, but the sister's prank had a more severe impact. The author's initial prank caused emotional harm (crying), while the sister's led to public shaming and family disapproval. However, the author's response is to cut off their sister entirely, which is a more permanent and serious action. \n\nIs cutting off a sibling an appropriate response? It might be if the sister's prank was a direct retaliation, but the author acknowledges they started it. The sister's action, while harmful, was a response to the author's first prank. However, the author's final decision is to end all communication, which could be seen as disproportionate. The sister's prank had serious consequences, but the author's punishment is also severe. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author had adult content might be a point to consider. While it's protected material, exposing it was the sister's choice, but the author's mom is now involved, so there's a family dynamic here. The author might have been aware of the potential consequences of keeping such material, but the sister's action escalated it beyond a simple prank.\n\nIn terms of proportionality, the author's prank caused crying, and the sister's caused public embarrassment. The author might feel they were retaliating, but cutting off the sister is a harsh measure. The sister might have overstepped, but the author's response is also extreme. The author needs to consider if cutting off is the right step or if there's a way to address the conflict without ending the relationship. \n\nSo, the author's action (cutting off) is a response to the sister's prank, but since the author initiated the prank war, they might share some responsibility. The sister's prank was more harmful in terms of public humiliation, but the author's punishment is also severe. It's a bit of a grey area. However, since the sister's action was a direct retaliation and the author's response is cutting off, which is more damaging to their relationship, the author could be seen as the asshole for taking it too far. But maybe the sister's prank was worse. Hmm.\n"
