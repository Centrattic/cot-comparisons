I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves two pranks: the first where the author gave the sister an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family during a visit from a girl the author is seeing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author initiated the prank by giving the sister the fake Xbox. That's a classic prank, but it's also potentially cruel because it made her cry. The sister's reaction was to get revenge. The retaliation involved exposing the author's private collection, which led to significant embarrassment and family conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here are the escalation and the intent. The author's initial prank might have been a joke, but it's questionable if it was appropriate, especially if it made the sister cry. The sister's response was more harmful, invading the author's privacy and exposing something personal in front of family and a potential romantic interest. The author now feels justified in cutting off the sister because of this retaliation.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong by cutting off their sister. The user believes the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's true. The author's actions started the cycle of pranks. The sister's prank was more severe, but it was a reaction. However, the author's response is to cut off the sister entirely. Is that justified?\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author initiated the conflict. While the sister escalated it, the author's initial prank set the stage. But cutting off a family member is a significant step. The author might feel wronged, but is cutting off the sister the right response? The sister's actions were hurtful, but does that mean the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship? Or is the sister the one who overstepped, making the author justified in cutting her off?\n\nAnother angle: sometimes, even if someone starts a conflict, the appropriate response isn't to end the relationship. The author's initial prank was a prank, but making the sister cry is problematic. The sister's retaliation was severe but a reaction. The author's current action\u2014cutting off the sister\u2014is a personal choice. The author might be the wronged party in this case, but is the response of cutting off too harsh? Or is it a valid self-defense to protect their privacy and prevent further harm?\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but the sister's actions were worse. So the question is whether the author is the asshole for cutting off the sister after their mutual pranks. The sister's prank was more harmful, but the author initiated the cycle. However, the sister's action was a direct retaliation that caused significant damage. The author's response is to cut her off, which might be seen as a proportionate response to protect themselves from further harm.\n\nIn the end, the sister's prank was more severe and crossed a line, but the author started the conflict. However, the author is now the one feeling wronged and cutting off the sister. Depending on the cultural context and family norms, cutting off a sibling is a major decision. The author might be justified in their response because the sister overstepped, but maybe the author should have handled it differently instead of cutting her off entirely.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong for cutting off the sister because the sister's prank was a significant violation, even if the author started the prank war. The author's decision to cut her off could be a way to set a boundary after a severe breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
