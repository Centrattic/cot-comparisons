I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (Reddit poster) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The story is a bit convoluted, so I need to parse it carefully.\n\nFirst, the initial prank: the author gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick inside. The sister cried, and the author had posted about that before. Then the sister retaliated. In this new situation, the author had a girl over, and the sister exposed their adult manga collection to the family, leading to humiliation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's side: they pranked the sister first with the Xbox prank, which upset her. Then, the sister took revenge by revealing the adult magazines. The author feels justified in cutting her off because the sister went too far. \n\nThe sister's side: she retaliated after being pranked. Maybe she felt the initial prank was worse, so her revenge was an overreaction, but was it justified? The author's prank made her cry, which is serious. Then, the sister did something that caused significant embarrassment. \n\nNow, the key points here: pranks can be a form of teasing, but when they cross into emotional harm or humiliation, they become problematic. The first prank (Xbox with a brick) made the sister cry, which suggests it was hurtful. The sister's retaliation involved exposing private, potentially sensitive material in front of family and a guest. That's a significant invasion of privacy and could be seen as a much more severe action.\n\nThe author is now cutting off their sister, which is a major step. The question is whether the sister's prank was so severe that the author's response is justified. In terms of proportionality, the sister's action led to long-term family embarrassment and possible family conflict, whereas the initial prank was maybe a joke that went too far. \n\nBut the author's own prank (the brick) made the sister cry, which might indicate that the author's initial action was not harmless. So, if both were trying to outdo each other in pranks, the sister's revenge was more damaging. However, the author is now cutting off the sister, which is a harsh measure. The author might be in the wrong if their retaliation (cutting off) is excessive compared to the sister's prank. \n\nAlternatively, if the sister's prank was a severe overreaction that caused significant harm, then the author's decision to cut her off could be seen as a reasonable response to protect their own well-being. \n\nBut the challenge here is determining the proportionality. The initial prank caused emotional harm (crying), and the sister's retaliation caused public humiliation. The author's response is to cut off the sister entirely. \n\nIn many cases, cutting off a family member is a major step, so unless the sister's actions were truly egregious, the author might be overreacting. However, if the sister's action caused lasting damage to the family's perception and the author's social standing, it's understandable. \n\nBut the sister was retaliating for a prank that was already hurtful. The author might have set a precedent by pranking first, which could be seen as contributing to the escalation. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, pranking is often seen as a bit of fun, but when it leads to emotional distress or public humiliation, it's frowned upon. The sister exposing the adult magazines was a violation of privacy and possibly a serious overstep. \n\nThe author's position is that they were justified in cutting off the sister because the sister's prank was worse than the initial one. But if the author initiated the prank that caused crying, then maybe the author shares some responsibility for the cycle of pranks escalating. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the sister's action was a direct and severe retaliation, but the author's cutting off is a proportionate response given the harm caused, then maybe not. However, if the author's initial prank started the conflict, then the author might have some responsibility. \n\nAlternatively, the sister's action was a clear violation that went beyond acceptable pranks, so the author's response is justified. \n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole\" dynamic, the user is seeking validation that their response was justified. The community often considers intent, harm caused, and proportionality. The sister's action caused significant public humiliation and family issues, which is worse than the initial prank. The author's cutting off is a response to the sister's severe action, which could be seen as acceptable. \n\nBut if the author's initial prank was the catalyst, they might be at least partially responsible. However, the sister's action was the direct cause of the current problem. \n\nI think the key here is that the sister's action was a serious overstep, and the author cutting off is a reasonable response given the harm caused. The author is not in the wrong for doing so. So the answer would be B.\n"
