I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank war between siblings that escalated. The author initially gave their sister a fake Xbox (a box with a brick), which made her cry. Now, the sister has retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family during a visit. The author is now cutting off their sister and wonders if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who started the prank war. The author initiated the first prank, which was cruel enough to make their sister cry. That's a strong indicator that the initial action was on the wrong side. Pranks that cause emotional harm are generally not acceptable, especially if they lead to distress like crying. So the author's first move might be the real issue here.\n\nThen the sister responded with her own prank. She took the adult magazines, which were already private and sensitive, and showed them to the family. That's definitely crossing a line. The author's privacy was violated, and it's understandable why they're upset. The sister's action led to significant embarrassment and strained family relationships.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister in response. The author is asking if their revenge for the prank is justified. But the key point is that the author's initial prank was the catalyst. They started the cycle of pranks, and the sister's retaliation, while extreme, was in response to that. The author's decision to cut off their sister after their own harmful prank might be seen as holding a grudge or escalating the conflict unnecessarily.\n\nHowever, the sister's action was more severe. Exposing someone's private collection in front of family is a major invasion of privacy and could be considered more harmful than a fake Xbox. But the author's justification is based on the prior prank. The problem is that the author's initial prank was the first instance of harm, and they are now reacting to the sister's response. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be expected to take responsibility for starting the prank that hurt their sister. The sister's retaliation, while extreme, was a response to the author's actions. If the author had stopped after being pranked, maybe the sister wouldn't have escalated. But the author took it further by cutting off their sister, so their current action is a consequence of the prank they initiated. \n\nAlso, the author's sister might be overreacting, but the fact remains that the author's prank first caused her to cry. So the author shouldn't be surprised when the sister takes a harsher approach. The author is now holding a grudge for a prank that was a response to their own. The sister's prank had a bigger impact, but the author's behavior started the problem. \n\nI think the consensus would be that the author is in the wrong because they initiated the harmful prank, and then took offense to the sister's retaliation. Even if the sister's action was worse, the author's initial wrongdoing makes them share the blame. Cutting off a sibling is a serious step, and if it's in response to a prank that was a reaction to the author's own prank, that complicates things. The author's responsibility for starting the conflict means they can't justifiably claim innocence and cut off contact without accountability.\n"
