I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a prank war between siblings that escalated.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked his sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, she retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit from a girl he's interested in. The author is cutting off his sister because he feels she went too far, but he's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Pranks can be a way to have fun, but when they cross into making someone cry, that's a red flag. The initial prank by the author was a prank that hurt his sister emotionally. Then, the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection in front of family and a potential romantic interest, which is a significant invasion of privacy and caused humiliation.\n\nThe author is cutting off his sister because he feels she crossed a line. But the prank he started also hurt her. The key point here is whether the author's actions (both the initial prank and then cutting off his sister) are justified. \n\nIn terms of the prank war, the author started it with a prank that made his sister cry. Then, when she retaliated, even if her method was worse, the author's response is to cut her off. The question is about who is more in the wrong. The sister's action was more harmful and public, but the author's initial prank was the catalyst. However, the sister's action was a direct response to the prank, making the situation a cycle of retaliation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, pranks that cause emotional harm are generally frowned upon. The sister's action was extreme, but the author's original prank also contributed to the escalation. The author now cuts off his sister, which is a form of punishment, but is that justified? The author's justification is that he was pranked first, but the sister's prank was on a much higher scale.\n\nHowever, cutting off family is a big step. The author could consider if there's a way to address the issue without cutting off contact. But given the humiliation and the impact on his reputation with the family and the girl, it's understandable he's upset. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial prank was hurtful, but the sister's retaliation was worse. The author's decision to cut her off is a response, but the prank war started with his action. However, the sister's action was more severe. In terms of the AITA framework, people are often considered the asshole if they start the conflict or escalate it. However, in this case, the sister escalated it, but the author is the one cutting off contact now. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for cutting off his sister because her prank was a severe invasion of privacy and caused significant harm. However, the initial prank was also at fault. But the main issue is the sister's response. So, the author is not in the wrong for cutting her off. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
