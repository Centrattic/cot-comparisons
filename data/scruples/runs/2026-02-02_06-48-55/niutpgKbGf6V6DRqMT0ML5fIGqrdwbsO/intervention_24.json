I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister due to a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The author initially gave their sister a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he has a crush on. The author now refuses to talk to her again and is wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The initial prank was a fake Xbox with a brick inside. That's a classic sibling prank, maybe a bit harsh if it made her cry, but not uncommon. The sister's retaliation involved exposing his private, adult content to family, which is definitely more serious. The author feels this was a severe overreaction and has cut ties, but he's questioning if he's justified.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation from a harmless prank (though it caused crying) to a prank that had lasting emotional and social consequences. The sister's action led to public humiliation in front of family and someone he's interested in. The author is now cutting her off, which is a harsh response, but is it justified?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The sister's prank had a bigger impact, but the author's initial prank might have provoked her. However, the principle of proportionality is important. The adult manga exposure is a significant invasion of privacy and could damage family relationships. The author's response is to cut her off, which is a severe punishment. But does the sister's action make that acceptable?\n\nI should consider if the author's prank was a precursor to his sister's more harmful one. However, even if it was a prank war, the sister's action is more severe. The author might not be the asshole for cutting her off, especially since her prank had real consequences. But maybe the author should have considered the potential for escalation when he started the prank. Alternatively, the sister overstepped, and the author is justified in cutting her off. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the initial prank and then cutting her off.\n\nIn the original Xbox prank, putting a brick in a box and making her cry might be crossing a line, but it's a prank. The sister's prank, however, involved exposing personal items to family, which is a bigger harm. The author's retaliation (cutting her off) is a response to a serious action. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here because the sister's prank was more damaging and the author is now protecting himself. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The initial prank might have been a bad start, but the sister's response escalated it. The author's decision to cut her off is a personal choice to protect his reputation and family relationships. So B is likely the correct answer.\n"
