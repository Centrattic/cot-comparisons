I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank gone wrong. \n\nFirst, the initial context: The author had previously pranked their sister by giving her a fake Xbox (a box with a brick), which made her cry. Now, in retaliation, the sister exposed the author's adult manga collection to the family in front of a girl he has a complicated relationship with. The author feels humiliated and has cut off their sister.\n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks and the consequences. The first prank led to emotional distress (crying), which suggests it might have been too harsh. The sister's retaliation, however, involved exposing private, personal items in front of family, leading to further embarrassment and family tension.\n\nThe author is asking if cutting off the sister is justified. They mention prior pranks and retaliation, but the sister's action was more invasive and public. The author's response is to cut off the sister, which is a severe action. \n\nI need to consider if the sister's prank was an overreaction or if the author's initial prank set a problematic precedent. The sister's action was more damaging socially and emotionally, especially in front of others. However, the author's cutting off communication is a form of punishment, but maybe not entirely unwarranted. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author initiated the prank that caused emotional harm first. The sister's retaliation, while harmful, might be seen as a response to that. However, the author's decision to cut off the sister could be seen as a justified reaction to the more severe prank. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongdoing, if the sister's prank was a clear escalation and caused significant harm, then cutting her off could be understandable. But if the author's initial prank was the problem, then maybe the author shares some responsibility. However, the sister crossed a line by exposing private items, which is more invasive and harmful. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the author's initial prank was acceptable. If the prank was harmful (making someone cry), then the author started the cycle. The sister's retaliation was more severe, but perhaps the author's cutting off is a reaction to that. So the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the sister's action was worse. However, if the author's initial prank was the root issue, maybe they should have stopped the cycle earlier. \n\nI think the key here is whether the sister's action was an escalation beyond what was justified. The author's initial prank caused emotional harm, and the sister's response caused public humiliation and family conflict. The author cutting off the sister might be seen as a response to a more severe offense. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But maybe they should have tried to resolve it without cutting off. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong for cutting off. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because they started the prank cycle. But the sister's action was worse. It's a bit of a gray area. The user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to determine if that's accurate.\n\nGiven that the sister crossed a clear line by exposing private items in front of family, which is a more serious violation, the author's reaction might be justified. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong). However, if the author's initial prank was the problem, then they might share some blame. But the sister's prank was more harmful. So the author's cutting off is a response to a worse action. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
