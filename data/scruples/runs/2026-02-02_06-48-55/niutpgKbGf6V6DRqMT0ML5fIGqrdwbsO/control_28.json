I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is the asshole for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings, starting with the author giving their sister a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliates by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family during a visit from a friend. The author is now cutting off their sister and wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The initial prank by the author involved making a fake Xbox with a brick inside, which was supposed to be a joke but ended up making his sister cry. That's pretty harsh. Pranks should be lighthearted and not cause emotional harm. The sister then seeks revenge by exposing his adult magazines, which is a big deal because it led to humiliation in front of family and a friend. \n\nThe key points here are: the initial prank's impact (made sister cry), the sister's retaliation (exposing private collection), and the aftermath. The author is now cutting off their sister, but the question is if they're the asshole.\n\nIn the first incident, the author's prank went too far, causing emotional distress. The sister's retaliation was also problematic because exposing someone's private items is a serious invasion of privacy and can cause significant embarrassment. Both actions were harmful, but which is worse?\n\nThe author's initial prank was intentional, but it had unintended consequences (sister crying). The sister's prank was a direct retaliation, targeting something personal and sensitive. The author might feel justified in cutting off their sister because the retaliation was severe. However, cutting off a family member is a significant action. But considering the sister crossed a line by exposing private items, the author's response might be seen as a way to protect themselves.\n\nIn terms of ethics, both acted inappropriately, but the sister's action had a more severe impact. The author's prank led to crying, but the sister's exposed them to family judgment. However, the author initiated the prank war. But the sister escalated it in a way that was more harmful. The author's decision to cut her off could be seen as a response to protect their privacy and reputation. \n\nBut maybe the author is also at fault for initiating the prank that caused the initial harm. However, the sister's response was a direct retaliation. It's a cycle of escalating pranks. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for cutting off their sister. Since the sister's action was worse, the author's response might be justified. However, cutting off family is a big step. But given the severity of the sister's prank, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because while both had faults, the sister's action was more severe and invasive, leading to justified cutting off.\n"
