I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. \n\nFirst, the situation started with a prank where the author gave his sister an empty Xbox box with a brick. He had previously posted about that and it made her cry. Now, she's retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection in front of the family and a girl he's seeing. The author is cutting her off and asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's punishment (cutting off his sister) is justified. Let's break down the actions of both sides. \n\nThe author's prank was making a fake Xbox, which made his sister cry. That's pretty harsh. Then, the sister's retaliation was exposing his adult magazines. The author argues that her prank was worse because it led to family embarrassment. But the sister's action was a direct response to the previous prank that hurt her feelings. \n\nNow, considering the escalation: the author started the prank war with something that caused emotional harm. The sister then took it further by exposing his adult content. The author is cutting her off because she crossed a line. But was his initial prank acceptable? If he did something that made her cry, maybe he was in the wrong first. The sister's action was a response, but she took it too far. \n\nHowever, the author is choosing to cut her off now. Is that fair? If the sister's action was a retaliation to the author's prank that caused her pain, then maybe the author's response is justified because she went too far. But the author was the initial aggressor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sister's action was an overreaction. Exposing someone's private collection in front of family and a guest is a serious breach. The author might feel justified in cutting her off because she crossed a line. But the author also started this by doing something that hurt her. \n\nOn Reddit, people often look at who started it and if the response is proportional. The author's prank made his sister cry, which is bad. The sister's retaliation was more severe. So the author might not be the asshole here because he's stopping the cycle after she went too far. But then again, he did start it. \n\nI think the key is whether cutting off the sister is proportionate. The prank was bad, but the sister's response was worse. The author is trying to end the conflict by cutting her off, which is a reasonable response. So maybe he's not the asshole.\n"
