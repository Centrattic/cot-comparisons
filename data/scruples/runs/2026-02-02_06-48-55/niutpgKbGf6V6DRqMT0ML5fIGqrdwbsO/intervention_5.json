I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection in front of family and a girl he's seeing. The author is cutting off the sister and wonders if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial prank and the sister's response. The author's prank led to emotional harm. Then the sister escalated it by exposing his private collection, causing significant embarrassment. The author is now cutting her off. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The initial prank by the author was mean, making the sister cry. That's not great. But then the sister took it further by revealing something very personal to the family. The author's reaction is to cut her off. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but maybe they need to take responsibility for their initial prank. However, the sister's retaliation was more severe. But is cutting off the sister the right move? The author's actions led to the sister's revenge, so maybe they should reflect on their own behavior first. \n\nBut the sister's action was clearly over the line, so the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the author's retaliation (cutting off) might be seen as a response to the sister's action, not the initial prank. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's prank was worse, but the author started the cycle. But in the current situation, the sister's action was the trigger. The author's response could be justified, but maybe they should have handled it differently. \n\nI think the sister is the asshole here for the extreme prank. The author, while having made a mistake before, is now reacting to the sister's overstep. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. The author's initial prank was wrong, but the question is about the current situation. The sister's action was the direct cause of the author cutting her off. So the author's current action is justified.\n"
