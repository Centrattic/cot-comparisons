I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a prank war between siblings. The author initially pranked his sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick inside, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family in front of his girl friend. The author is now cutting off his sister and asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's prank led to his sister crying, which is pretty harsh. Pranks that cause emotional harm are generally not okay. The sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection. But the problem here is the context. The author had a history of pranking, which might have led to this escalation. The sister's action was a direct response, but exposing someone's private items in front of family and a friend is a significant breach of privacy. \n\nHowever, the author's initial prank was also problematic because it made his sister cry. So, both sides have done things that could be considered wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister after her prank. The author argues that the sister went too far, but he also started the prank war. The sister's action was more harmful, but the author's initial prank was also harmful. The key is whether cutting off contact is justified after mutual pranks, but the sister's action was more severe. \n\nBut the problem is that the author is the one who initiated the prank that caused emotional distress. Then the sister escalated it. The author is now cutting off his sister, but maybe he should take responsibility for starting the conflict. However, the sister's action was worse. It's a bit of a gray area. In these AITA scenarios, often the person who escalates the situation is the one in the wrong. Since the author's sister's action was more harmful, but the author started it, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But he's still cutting off his sister, which could be seen as the wrong move if he's not taking responsibility. \n\nThe Reddit community usually looks at who did the worse thing and if the response is proportional. The sister's action was worse, so the author might have a reason to be upset. However, cutting off a sibling is a big step. But maybe in this case, the sister overstepped, so the author isn't the asshole. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
