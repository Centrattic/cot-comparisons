I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation involves two pranks: the brother gave the sister an \"Xbox\" that was actually a brick, which made her cry, and then the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga during a family gathering where he had brought a girl over.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The initial prank by the brother was pretty harsh. Using an empty box with a brick as a substitute for an Xbox and making the sister cry is a significant overstep, especially since it caused emotional harm. Pranks can be light-hearted, but when they lead to someone crying, it's probably gone too far.\n\nThen, the sister's revenge involved exposing his private collection in front of the family and the girl. This is also a big deal. The brother's magazines are personal, and even if they're not illegal or harmful, exposing them in such a public family setting could be seen as a violation of privacy. The sister might have felt justified in her retaliation because of the earlier prank, but the consequences for the brother were severe\u2014humiliation, family disapproval, and the girl mocking him.\n\nThe question is whether the brother's decision to cut off the sister is justified. Both pranks escalated the situation. The first prank was a brick in a box, which was mean, and the sister's retaliation was exposing his private stuff. The brother is now cutting her off, which is a harsh response, but considering the sister's action caused significant damage to his reputation with the family, maybe he feels it's necessary.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? The initial prank was clearly harmful. The sister's prank was also inappropriate and caused lasting harm. The brother's response is cutting her off, which is a form of punishment. However, pranks should be mutual and not escalate to serious consequences. If the sister's action was a direct retaliation for the brother's prank, but the brother's prank might have been the first wrong. However, the sister's action was also a clear overstep. \n\nThe Reddit community might weigh in on the escalation. The first prank made the sister cry, which is bad. The sister then did something equally bad or worse. The brother cutting her off after her prank could be seen as a justified self-defense to protect his reputation, but the initial prank was his fault. However, the sister's action is what led to the current situation. So, maybe the brother is not entirely in the wrong because the sister's action directly caused the problem, and he's trying to distance himself. But the initial prank was his mistake. However, the sister's action is what prompted the cutting off, so the question is whether exposing his collection is on the same level as the brick prank. \n\nIn the end, the brother's decision to cut her off is a result of her prank, which was a direct retaliation for his previous prank. But the sister's action was more harmful and damaging. So the brother might not be in the wrong because he's reacting to her over-the-top revenge. However, the initial prank was his fault. But since the question is about the current situation where he's cutting her off, the main issue is the sister's recent action. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), as the sister's prank was the immediate cause of the fallout, and the brother is cutting her off in response. But the initial prank is part of the context. However, the key here is that the sister's action was more severe and led to the current problem, so the brother's reaction could be justified.\n"
