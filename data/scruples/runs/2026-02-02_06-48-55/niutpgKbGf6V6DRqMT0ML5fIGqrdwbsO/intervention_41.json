I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they cut off their sister after a prank war. The initial prank involved a fake Xbox with a brick, which made the sister cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection in front of family and a girl he's dating.\n\nFirst, the author started the prank, which led to the sister being upset. Then the sister's revenge escalated significantly. The key here is whether the author's actions (cutting off the sister) are justified after the sister's prank. The author's prank caused emotional harm, but the sister's response was more severe and public. The author now feels justified in cutting ties. \n\nHowever, pranks can be a slippery slope. The initial prank might have been inconsiderate, leading to the sister's emotional reaction. The sister's retaliation was also inconsiderate and caused major embarrassment. The author's response (cutting off) might be seen as disproportionate to the sister's prank, but the sister's actions were also over the line. \n\nLegally, neither is wrong, but in terms of social norms, pranks should be harmless. The sister's action was more harmful, so the author's response could be seen as justified. But the author started the prank war. The question is whether the author's final action (cutting off) is the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I have to decide based on the scenario. \n\nThe author's prank led to the sister's retaliation, which was worse. Cutting off a sibling is a big step, but if the sister crossed a line, maybe it's justified. Alternatively, the author could have resolved it through communication instead of cutting off. However, the sister's prank was more damaging, so the author's anger is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister's prank was worse, maybe not. The answer is B (No).\n"
