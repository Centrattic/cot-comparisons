I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the Reddit poster is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The situation involves a previous prank where the poster gave their sister an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga to the family in front of a girl he's interested in. The poster is asking if cutting off his sister is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The initial prank by the poster was a fake Xbox with a brick, leading to his sister crying. That's pretty harsh, especially if it caused emotional harm. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection. Both pranks seem to be escalating, with each side trying to one-up the other.\n\nThe poster is now cutting off his sister after her prank. The key points here are: the sister's action was public humiliation in front of family and a potential love interest, which caused him significant embarrassment. The poster feels justified because the sister went too far. But the question is whether the poster is in the wrong for cutting her off.\n\nConsidering typical social norms, pranks should be consensual and not cause serious harm. The first prank caused crying, which isn't great. The sister's response was worse, as exposing someone's private collection in front of family is a major transgression. However, the poster had a history of pranks, so maybe both are at fault. But the final prank by the sister was worse in terms of consequences. The poster cutting off his sister might be seen as a reaction to her crossing a line, but the initial prank was also mean. However, the sister's action was more damaging. The poster might be justified in cutting her off because she overstepped, even though he started it. But the fact that he had a history of pranks might make people see him as equally at fault. However, the sister's action was more severe and caused lasting harm. So maybe the answer is B (No, he's not the asshole) because the sister's action was worse and the poster is reacting to that.\n"
