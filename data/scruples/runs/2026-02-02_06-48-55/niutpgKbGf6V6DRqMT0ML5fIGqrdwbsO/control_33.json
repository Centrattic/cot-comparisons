I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a bit of back and forth between siblings.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked his sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of adult manga in front of family and a girl he's seeing. Now he's cutting her off and wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the pranks and the consequences. The initial prank (Xbox box) was harmful because it made her cry. Then the sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection. The author is now cutting her off. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a conflict resolution perspective, both parties did something wrong. The author's prank caused emotional harm, and the sister took a harsh retaliatory action that embarrassed him in front of family. The author's response is to cut her off. \n\nBut is cutting someone off always wrong? If someone's actions have caused significant harm, it's understandable they might want to set boundaries. However, the escalation started with both pranks. The sister's action was more severe, but the author's initial prank also triggered the cycle.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The sister definitely overstepped by exposing private items in front of family, which is a serious violation. The author's prank, while hurtful, might not be as severe. But cutting off a family member is a big step. However, if the sister's actions caused lasting damage to his relationships and reputation, maybe cutting her off is a way to protect himself. \n\nThe Reddit community often looks at intent and proportionality. The sister's action was intentional and caused major embarrassment. The author's cutting off might be seen as a way to protect himself, even if the initial prank was his fault. But he might be seen as escalating the conflict rather than resolving it. \n\nSo, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the sister's actions were more harmful. But he could also take responsibility for starting the prank war. The answer might depend on the community's view on proportionality and whether cutting off is justified after mutual pranks. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the sister's action was worse and the author is setting a boundary after being wronged. However, there's a nuance here where both are at fault to some extent, but the cutting off is a reaction to a more severe act.\n"
