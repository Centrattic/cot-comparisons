I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down. The situation involves two pranks between siblings. First, the author prankingly gave their sister a brick instead of an Xbox, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection to the family during a visit.\n\nThe author is now cutting off their sister and asking if they're an AITA (Am I the Asshole). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A and B. Let me consider the elements here.\n\nThe first prank: using a brick as a fake Xbox. That's pretty mean, especially if it made her cry. It's one thing to play a prank, but if it's causing emotional harm, it's crossing a line. The author mentioned it in a previous post, so maybe others there thought it was too harsh. Then the sister's revenge involved exposing his private collection, which he considers adult material. He's upset because his family found out, and the girl mocked him. He's now cutting off his sister, but is this justified?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister after this. The key points are the escalation of pranks. The initial prank was harmful (making her cry), and the sister's response was even more damaging (humiliating him in front of family and a girl). The author is claiming self-defense, that the sister's prank was worse, so he's cutting her off. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe because he started the cycle with the brick prank.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions (cutting off the sister) are justified. From a moral standpoint, pranks that cause harm are generally considered bad, but the sister took it further. However, cutting off a sibling is a big step. The author is upset about being labeled a \"Weeb\" and family disapproval. But maybe the author should have considered the consequences of their initial prank. If he pranked her first, and she retaliated, is it fair to cut off communication? Or should he have addressed it without pranking her back?\n\nAlso, the sister's action is a significant breach of privacy. Exposing someone's private collection, especially involving adult content, is a severe violation. The author might feel that the sister overstepped, but does that make cutting off the sister justified? It's possible the author is reacting in a way that's too extreme, but the sister's prank was worse. However, the cycle of pranks leading to this outcome complicates things. The author started the conflict, so maybe they share some responsibility. But the sister escalated it beyond proportion. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The author's prank was mean, but the sister's response was more harmful. However, cutting off the sister is a harsh punishment. Maybe the author should have talked to the sister instead of pranking her. Alternatively, the sister's action was a clear violation, so the author isn't the asshole for cutting her off. But the initial prank's severity and the subsequent retaliation need to be weighed.\n\nIn the end, the sister's action was a major privacy invasion and caused public humiliation. The author's response is to cut her off, which is a personal choice but might be justified given the sister's overstep. However, the author did start the conflict with a prank that caused emotional harm. So perhaps both have some fault, but the sister's action is worse. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. If the sister's action was worse, then the author isn't the asshole. But if the author should have handled it without cutting off the sister, maybe they are. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nI think the sister's action was more severe and the author is reacting to that, so the author isn't the asshole. But wait, by pranking first, he might be at fault for starting the conflict. However, the sister's prank was worse. So the author's decision to cut her off is a reaction to her more harmful action. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
