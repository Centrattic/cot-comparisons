I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a sibling prank war that escalated.\n\nFirst, the author pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox box with a brick inside, which made her cry. Now the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection in front of their family and a girl he was dating. The author is cutting off contact with his sister and is questioning if he's the asshole for doing so. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to analyze the actions of both parties. The initial prank by the author involved deception (fake Xbox, brick inside) leading to emotional harm (sister crying). Pranks that cause distress can be problematic, especially if they target someone's emotions. The sister's retaliation was exposing his private collection in a family setting, which is a serious invasion of privacy and caused significant embarrassment. \n\nThe key question is whether the author's actions (cutting off the sister) are justified given the escalation. The author's original prank was hurtful, but the sister's response was more severe and potentially more harmful. However, the author also admits he initiated the prank war. The sister overstepped by exposing private items, which is a bigger transgression than the initial prank. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the author might be seen as contributing to the conflict by starting the prank. But the sister's actions were more damaging. The author's decision to cut her off is a response to her overstep, which could be seen as a reasonable boundary setting. \n\nHowever, the author is also being asked if he's the asshole for cutting her off. If pranks are mutual but the sister's action was worse, the author's response might be justified. But since he started the prank, does that make him partially at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. The question is about whether he's in the wrong now for cutting her off, not the initial prank. The sister's action was a clear violation, so the author's decision to cut her off might be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
