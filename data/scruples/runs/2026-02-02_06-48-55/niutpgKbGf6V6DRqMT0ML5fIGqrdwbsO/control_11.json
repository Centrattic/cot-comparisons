I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister over a prank incident. The situation involves some back and forth between siblings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author previously pranked their sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga to their family in front of a girl he's seeing. The author is now cutting off their sister and wonders if he's the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the pranks and the escalation. The first prank (fake Xbox) caused emotional distress. The sister's revenge was far more severe, exposing private items to the family, which led to humiliation. The author is now cutting off contact because of this.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off his sister. On one hand, the sister's action was more harmful, invading privacy and causing embarrassment. On the other hand, the author initiated the prank that led to this cycle. But the sister escalated it beyond the initial prank, making it a serious breach.\n\nThe author is responding to what he perceives as a betrayal. Cutting off a relationship is a big step, but if the sister's actions were genuinely hurtful and there's a history of pranks, maybe it's understandable. However, the author also started the prank war, which might make him share some responsibility. But the sister crossed a line by exposing his private collection. The author is defending himself from a more severe violation.\n\nSo, considering the escalation and the fact that the sister went beyond a prank into a personal attack, the author might not be the asshole for cutting her off. The key is whether the author's action was a reasonable response to the sister's more serious transgression. The sister's prank was not just a joke but invaded his privacy and damaged his relationships. Therefore, the author might be justified in cutting her off, even if he started the pranks.\n"
