I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The user is asking if cutting off their sister after a prank makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, the background: The author previously pranked their sister by giving her an empty Xbox box with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's collection of Japanese manga with risqu\u00e9 content in front of their family and a girl he's seeing. The author is now cutting off the sister and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nHmm, pranks can be a tricky situation. The initial prank (Xbox with a brick) was pretty harsh, making her cry. That's not a good start. The sister then took revenge by exposing the author's private collection. That's a significant invasion of privacy and could be considered going too far.\n\nThe author is now cutting off the sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the escalation of pranks and the impact of each action. The first prank hurt the sister, and the retaliation was even more damaging, affecting the author's family and personal relationships. \n\nThe sister's action is a serious breach of trust and privacy. However, the author also initiated the prank war with a harmful action first. But in this case, the sister's retaliation was more severe and caused lasting damage. The author's response is cutting off communication, which might be seen as justified given the harm caused. \n\nBut is the author the asshole for cutting off the sister? The sister's action was worse, but the initial prank was also unkind. However, the final prank by the sister was more hurtful. The author's decision to stop talking to her could be seen as a way to set a boundary, especially after such a public humiliation and damage to their reputation. \n\nSo, considering that the sister overstepped, the author's response might not be the wrong here. The answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. But I should check if cutting off a family member is inherently wrong regardless. However, if the sister's action was a clear violation, then the author's response is understandable. So, the answer is B.\n"
