I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The author initially pranked their sister by giving her an Xbox that was just a box with a brick, which made her cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his \"adult\" manga collection to the family and a girl he was seeing. The author is cutting off the sister and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author started the prank, which was cruel because it made his sister cry. That's a red flag. Then the sister responded with a more severe prank, which was exposing his private collection. The author is now cutting off his sister, so the question is whether his initial prank and subsequent actions make him the asshole.\n\nPranks can be a gray area, but when they cause emotional harm, like making someone cry, it's a problem. The sister's retaliation was more harmful, but the author's initial action contributed to the escalation. The key here is whether the author's actions, both the original prank and cutting off his sister, are justified. \n\nThe author's prank caused distress, so maybe he was in the wrong first. However, the sister's response was worse. But the author is now cutting off his sister as a result. The question is if the author is the asshole for cutting her off. The author's justification is that the sister went too far, but he started the conflict. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often focus on who escalated the situation. The sister's action was more harmful, but the author's initial prank was also wrong. However, the sister's prank had more severe consequences. The author is now cutting off his sister, which is a harsh response. The AITA community usually considers intent and the proportionality of the actions. The author might be seen as contributing to the problem by starting the prank war, even if the sister escalated it. But the sister's action was worse, so maybe the author isn't the asshole in cutting her off. However, the initial prank was still wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author is being held responsible for starting the conflict. If the initial prank was cruel, then he's partially at fault. But the sister's revenge was worse. The user's answer is A (yes, author is in the wrong), but I need to determine if that's accurate. The author's actions led to the conflict, so maybe he's in the wrong for cutting off his sister as a result of his own initial mistake. Or maybe the sister's actions were so bad that the author's response is justified. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's initial prank was wrong, but the sister's response was worse. However, cutting off family over a prank might be excessive. The author might be in the wrong for starting it, but the sister's action is worse. However, the AITA usually focuses on the latest action. The latest action is the sister exposing his manga, so the author cutting her off. If the sister's action was so bad, then the author is justified. But if the author's initial prank was the start, then he's partially at fault. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the sister crossed a line, but the initial prank was also problematic. I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the answer is B because the sister's action was worse, so the author isn't the asshole for cutting her off.\n"
