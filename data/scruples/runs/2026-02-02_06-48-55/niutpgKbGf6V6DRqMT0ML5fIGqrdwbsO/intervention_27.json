I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off communication with their sister following a prank war. The initial prank was the fake Xbox with a brick, which made the sister cry. Now, the sister retaliated by exposing his collection of Japanese manga with risqu\u00e9 content in front of family and a girl he's interested in. The author is now cutting her off and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The original prank by the author was pretty mean. Giving a fake Xbox with a brick is a harsh prank, especially if it made the sister cry. The sister's revenge involved exposing his private collection, which is a significant invasion of privacy and caused public humiliation. \n\nThe author is cutting off the sister because of this, but they also had a history of pranks. The question is whether the author's actions (both the initial prank and cutting off the sister) make them the asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nPranks are a common form of sibling rivalry, but when they escalate, it can become problematic. The initial prank was probably unkind, leading to the sister's retaliation. The sister's action was more severe, invading privacy and causing lasting damage. However, cutting off a family member for revenge might be seen as extreme. \n\nThe key points are: the author initiated a prank that hurt the sister, the sister escalated it by exposing his private stuff, and the author is cutting her off. While the sister's action was worse, the author's initial prank set the tone. However, cutting off family is a major step. The author could have chosen a different response, like talking it out rather than severing contact. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, both acted inappropriately. The author's initial prank was the catalyst, but the sister's retaliation was worse. The author's decision to cut off the sister could be seen as holding onto a grudge. However, the sister crossed a line by exposing private items. \n\nReddit's AITA community often looks at who escalated the situation and who caused the most harm. Here, the sister's action had more lasting negative effects. But the author's initial prank was also inconsiderate. The answer might be that the author isn't the asshole because the sister's action was more severe, but the author's retaliation (cutting off) is also extreme. However, the sister's action was the main issue. The author's cutting off could be justified as a defense from further harm, but it's a harsh measure. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be the asshole, but there's a nuance. The sister definitely went too far, but the author's initial prank was also problematic. However, the main harm was done by the sister. So the answer is B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
