I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where they pranked their sister and now she retaliated by exposing his adult manga to the family. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author previously pranked the sister with an Xbox that had a brick inside, which made her cry. Then the sister waited for a chance to retaliate. When the author had a girl over, the sister exposed his private collection in front of the family, causing embarrassment and damage to his reputation.\n\nThe author now cut off contact with the sister and is asking if they're the asshole. The user's opinion is that the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author initiated the prank with the Xbox, which was mean and made the sister cry. That's a clear transgression. The sister's retaliation was more severe, but maybe she was just reacting to the prior prank. However, the sister's action was a violation of privacy and exposed the author's personal items in front of family and a guest. That's a major breach of trust and boundaries. \n\nThe author is now cutting off the sister because of this. The question is whether the author's actions (prank and then cutting off) make them the asshole. Even if the sister's revenge was harsh, the author started the conflict with a prank that hurt her. But the sister's response was also extreme. However, cutting off a family member over a prank and a retaliation that was a privacy violation might be an overreaction. The author might be holding a grudge or not taking responsibility for their initial action. \n\nBut the sister's action is worse. Exposing someone's private collection in front of family is a significant violation. However, the author's prank also caused emotional harm. The author might be justified in cutting off the sister, but maybe not. The line is whether the author's initial prank was acceptable. Since the author made the sister cry, that's a problem. The sister's retaliation was harsh, but the author's escalation could be seen as the root of the problem. \n\nThe user says they think the author is wrong, which I can see because the author's prank was the start of it. But the sister's action was worse. However, cutting off a sibling because of a prank and a severe retaliation might not be entirely the author's fault, but the author's initial prank was the catalyst. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they started the cycle of pranks, leading to the sister's retaliation. The author's decision to cut off the sister could be seen as a reasonable response to the sister's actions, but the initial prank was inconsiderate. However, the sister's action was worse. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. If the sister's act was a violation, then the author's response might be justified. But the prank that made the sister cry is a problem. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn AITA threads, often the person who starts the conflict is the asshole, even if the other side retaliates in a worse way. Because starting the conflict is the initial wrongdoing. So the author's prank that made the sister cry is the first issue. Then the sister's action is a response, but the author's initial prank is the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for starting the conflict. However, the sister's action was worse. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. The author's response is to cut off the sister after she exposed the magazines. The author might be justified in cutting off the sister because of that act, but the initial prank is still a problem. However, the AITA question is specifically about cutting off the sister. So the focus is on the current action, not the initial prank. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the entire situation. \n\nI think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because the initial prank was cruel (making the sister cry) and the author's current action of cutting off the sister is a response to a more severe violation, but the author's initial prank started the conflict. However, the sister's act was worse. But in AITA terms, maybe the author is the asshole for starting the prank war, leading to the sister's retaliation. Alternatively, the sister's act is so severe that the author's retaliation is understandable. But the author's initial prank is a problem. \n\nI'm a bit torn. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the entire context, the author's prank was the first transgression. So the answer is A.\n"
