I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. The situation is a bit of a back-and-forth between the two siblings.\n\nFirst, the author pranked their sister by giving her a \"Xbox\" that was actually a brick. The sister was upset about that, which is probably why she took revenge. Then, when the author had a girl over, the sister took the opportunity to expose his adult manga collection to the family. The author is now cut off from his sister and is wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer, A for yes, B for no. So I need to analyze the situation and decide if the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe key points here are the escalation of pranks. The author's initial prank made their sister cry, which might be a red flag. Then, when the sister retaliates, the author feels justified in cutting her off. But the sister's prank had a much more serious consequence, exposing private materials and causing significant embarrassment. \n\nThe question is whether the author's response (cutting off the sister) is appropriate given the sister's prank. Pranks can be light-hearted, but when they result in emotional harm or public humiliation, they cross a line. The author's prank was maybe a bit harsh, but the sister's retaliation was even more severe. However, the author's cutting off the sister is a form of punishment. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The sister's prank was more harmful, so the author's retaliation might be seen as understandable. However, the author initiated the prank war, so maybe there's some responsibility there. \n\nI need to balance both sides. The sister's action was worse, but the author's initial prank started the conflict. The author's decision to cut her off could be seen as a proportionate response given the sister's more severe prank, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the author should have de-escalated instead of cutting someone off entirely. \n\nIn terms of ethics, pranks should be consensual and not cause real harm. The author's prank caused the sister to cry, which is a problem. The sister's prank was even more damaging. However, cutting off a family member is a serious action. \n\nBut the user is specifically asking if the author is in the wrong. The sister's prank was worse, so the author's response might be justified. However, the author's initial prank was also harmful. But since the sister escalated it, the author might not be the asshole here. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The sister's prank was more severe and non-consensual, leading to humiliation. The author's decision to cut her off is a reaction to that, so they might not be the asshole.\n"
