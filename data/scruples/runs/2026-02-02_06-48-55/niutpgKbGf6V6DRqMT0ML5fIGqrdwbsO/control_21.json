I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after a prank. The situation involves a prank war between siblings. The original poster (OP) had given their sister a fake Xbox with a brick, which made her cry. Then the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga collection in front of the family and a girl he's seeing. He's now cut her off and wonders if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The sister's prank led to emotional harm, as the OP's prank made her cry. Then she took a more severe action by exposing his personal items, causing public humiliation. The OP is cutting her off as a result. \n\nPranks can be a gray area, especially among siblings. The first prank (fake Xbox) might be considered a bit harsh, especially if it made her cry. But the sister's response was more damaging, exposing his private collection which caused long-term family issues. The OP's reaction of cutting her off could be seen as justified given the severity of the sister's action. However, the initial prank by the OP might have started the cycle of retaliation.\n\nBut the key point is whether the OP is in the wrong for cutting off the sister. The sister's action was clearly more harmful. However, the OP's initial prank was also part of the problem. The sister's action was a direct response, but the OP's decision to cut off the sister might be seen as a justified self-defense after being wronged. Alternatively, some might argue that both parties are at fault for escalating the pranks. However, the question is whether the OP is in the wrong. Since the sister's action was more severe and directly caused harm, the OP's response might be seen as a reasonable reaction, making him not the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
