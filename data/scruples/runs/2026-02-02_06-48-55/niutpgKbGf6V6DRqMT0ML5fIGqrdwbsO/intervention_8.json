I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister after she pranked them. The situation involves some previous pranks and a recent incident where the sister exposed the author's adult manga collection to the family.\n\nFirst, let's recap the story. The author had previously pranked their sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing his adult manga in front of the family and a girl he's interested in. The author is now cutting off their sister, feeling humiliated and angry, and is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. So, we need to assess both sides. \n\nStarting with the author's actions: the fake Xbox prank led to the sister crying. That's pretty harsh. Then, the sister's prank was exposing his private collection. The author now cuts off their sister, which is a severe response. The question is whether cutting off the sister is justified, especially considering the previous prank.\n\nThe sister's prank is more invasive and harmful. Exposing someone's private collection in public, especially in front of family and a potential romantic interest, is a significant violation of privacy. It's more than just a prank; it's a breach of trust and can cause lasting damage to relationships. The sister's action was more harmful and invasive than the original prank. \n\nHowever, the author initiated the prank that hurt the sister first. The fake Xbox leading to her crying shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. But when the sister retaliated, her prank escalated the conflict. The author's response now is cutting off contact, which is a form of punishment. \n\nNow, considering the line of pranks: the author's prank caused emotional harm (crying), the sister's retaliate with a prank that caused public humiliation and potential family conflict. The author feels justified in cutting off their sister. But is cutting off a fair response? The sister's prank was worse in terms of impact, but the cycle started with the author. \n\nIs the author the asshole for cutting off the sister? Well, pranks can be playful, but when they cause emotional harm or public humiliation, they cross a line. The author's initial prank was harmful, but the sister's was worse. However, cutting off a sibling is a major decision. The author might be seeking revenge, which can be seen as retaliatory. But given the sister's action, maybe it's understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a position where they had a collection they knew could be problematic if exposed. Maybe they should have kept it more private. However, the sister's action was an overstep. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the sister definitely went too far. The author's prank was bad, but the sister's response was worse. The author cutting off their sister could be seen as a reaction to the sister's harmful prank, not the initial one. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here. \n\nBut some might argue that the author started the prank war, leading to this outcome. However, the sister's action was the direct cause of the current problem. The author's decision to cut off contact is a reaction to the sister's worst behavior. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They are reacting to a more severe prank from their sister, even though their initial prank was problematic. The sister's action was more harmful and invasive, leading to the author's justified decision to cut ties.\n"
