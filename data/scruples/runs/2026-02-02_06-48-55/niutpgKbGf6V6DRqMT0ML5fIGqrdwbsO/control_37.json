I posted about it before, but basically i gave her an \"Xbox\". It was just the empty box with a brick inside. Long story short, it made her cry.(https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/a9qbke/aita_for_pranking_my_sister_in_front_of_our/).\n\n\nNow, after that day, she vowed revenge. I always felt i was to smart to be pranked, but i guess i was wrong. This morning, i had a girl over. She's a little more then i freind, but not exactly a girlfriend. It's complicated. But what happened was she was over when my family was out on a trip, but my family came back earlier then expected. The girl stayed though and i introduced her to the family. So, they started to ask her questions and my sister just disappeared. It was all going surprisingly well, until my sister came back. She had gotten my secret collection of \"adult\" magazines and exposed them to my family. In front of this girl.\n\n\nThey aren't Playboy or anything. They are Japanese Manga books with some very risque drawings that i've had for years. I tried taking them back from her, but i didn't want to risk ripping them and mom wouldn't let me have them back. She thumbed through and showed my family all the drawings inside. There was some nudity, large breasted girls, even a lesbian scene.\n\n\nIt was incredibly humiliating. My mom won't let me look at them and has been asking me to sell them (because i have younger siblings who might see them), this girl has been mocking me and calling me a Weeb, my Uncle has been onto me about looking at lewd drawings over real women.\n\n\nShe has pretty much ruined my standing with my family. And i've vowed to never talk to her again. She has stepped over the line.\n\n\nBut, i've been thinking, am i really the asshole here for cutting her off and pranking her before hand for making her do this? Or is Exposing my hentai books to my family on the same level as the Xbox prank?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after cutting off their sister following a prank. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author previously pranked their sister with a fake Xbox, which made her cry. Then, the sister retaliated by exposing the author's adult manga collection to the family during a visit from a girl. The author now feels humiliated and has cut off the sister, wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's actions (pranking and cutting off the sister) are justified compared to the sister's prank. The author's initial prank (fake Xbox) caused emotional harm, which is not great. Then the sister's prank was more severe, exposing private items and leading to family embarrassment. The author now thinks the sister went too far and cut her off.\n\nIn the AITA subreddit, the community often evaluates both sides. The key factors here are intent, proportionality, and the impact of each person's actions. The author's prank was a joke but caused crying, indicating it was too harsh. The sister's retaliation was worse, exposing private items. However, the author's cut-off is a response to the sister's actions. The question is if the author is the asshole for cutting off the sister.\n\nThe author might argue that the sister escalated things beyond a prank. The sister might have crossed a line by exposing private items, especially affecting family relationships. However, the author also initiated the prank war. In terms of proportionality, the sister's action was more severe. The author's response of cutting off the sister could be seen as a reaction to protect their reputation, but cutting someone off is a harsh measure. However, given the sister's action was more damaging, the author's response might be understandable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person who starts the conflict and escalates it might be considered the asshole. The author started with the prank, but the sister escalated it. The author's current action (cutting off) is a response to the severe prank. The sister's prank had a lasting impact, so the author might not be at fault here. The answer would depend on whether the author's initial prank and their response are proportionate. Since the sister's action was worse, the author might not be the asshole. So, the answer is B.\n"
