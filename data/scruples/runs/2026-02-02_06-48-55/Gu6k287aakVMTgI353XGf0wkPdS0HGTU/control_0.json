I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear about not wanting kids since she was 16, and she always makes sure her dates share her views. Now, her boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids, and she's shut down those conversations. She even told him to leave if he wants kids, which he hasn't. His mom is upset, thinking the author doesn't love him, but she insists she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author is upfront about her stance on having children from the beginning of the relationship. That's a key factor because honesty and alignment on such a major life decision are important. She's not trying to change her mind later on; she's consistent. Her reasons include financial concerns, the work involved, and personal preferences (like wanting dogs instead). These are valid reasons, as having kids is a significant commitment with real-life implications.\n\nHer boyfriend's snippy comments might indicate he's not happy with the situation. But since she's been clear all along, it's not like she hid her feelings. The user might want to know if she's being too harsh by telling him to leave if he wants kids. However, if someone has a strong stance on something, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The boyfriend is an adult and should respect her decision unless he's willing to compromise or end the relationship. His mom's disapproval is external and shouldn't reflect the author's feelings unless there's a deeper issue in how she's communicating her stance.\n\nIn relationships, major life decisions like having kids need mutual agreement. If the boyfriend can't accept her no, maybe the issue is his inability to respect her boundaries, not her being in the wrong. The author is being honest and direct, which is a responsible approach. So, based on this, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, maybe the boyfriend was under the impression she might change her mind, but the author has been consistent. Since she's upfront, that's less likely. Her reasoning is practical and personal, which are legitimate. So, yeah, B makes sense.\n"
