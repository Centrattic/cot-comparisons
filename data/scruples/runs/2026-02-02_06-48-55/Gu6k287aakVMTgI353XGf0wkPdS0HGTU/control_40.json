I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and being firm about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship where she's always been clear about not wanting children. Her boyfriend, who's older, has been making snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts those conversations down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids financially and she prefers dogs over children.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author has been upfront about her stance on children from a young age, communicates it clearly in relationships, and is in a long-term relationship where this topic keeps coming up. Her reasons include financial constraints, the workload of kids, and personal preference for pets.\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. The key factors here are communication, mutual understanding, and respect in a relationship. The author has been clear about her position, which is a positive step. It's important in relationships for both parties to have compatible long-term goals, like having children. If the boyfriend hasn't been able to accept her stance after five years, maybe the issue is on his end for not respecting her boundaries. However, relationships require compromise, so if having kids is a deal-breaker for him, he might feel justified in seeking someone who shares his desires.\n\nBut the author isn't forcing him to stay; she's given him a choice if he can't accept her decision. The problem might stem from his inability to accept her choice, not necessarily her being wrong. Also, financial reasons are valid, and she's being honest about that. The boyfriend's mother's opinion isn't her issue unless she's deliberately trying to hurt him, which she's not.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because she's communicated her stance early and clearly. The boyfriend may need to decide if he can be happy without children. The answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
