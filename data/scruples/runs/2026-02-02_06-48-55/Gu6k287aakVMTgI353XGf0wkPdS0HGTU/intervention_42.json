I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting kids and her boyfriend being upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear since she was 16 that she doesn't want kids. She makes sure her partners don't want kids either. The boyfriend is older, and he's making comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation and has even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she claims she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. So I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has been upfront about her stance on kids from the start. She's been with this boyfriend for five years, and he's only now making snippy comments. She's made her position clear, so he should have known this wasn't going to change. If he couldn't accept that, maybe the relationship isn't right for him. Also, financial constraints are a valid reason not to have kids, and wanting pets instead is a personal choice.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend feels that the author is being too rigid or not considering his desires. However, the author hasn't been indifferent; she's made her position clear from the beginning. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might add pressure, but the author's feelings towards her partner shouldn't be judged by his mother. The key point is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since she's been consistent and upfront, it's hard to say she's wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from personal desires not being met, but that doesn't make the author at fault.\n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't even afford their apartment, so having kids would be a stretch. The author's reasons are practical and personal, which are valid. The boyfriend's comments might be trying to push her to reconsider, but she's firm in her decision. In relationships, it's important that both parties align on major life decisions like having kids. If he can't accept her stance, maybe it's time for him to reconsider the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's been clear and consistent, and her reasons are valid. The boyfriend's frustration is his issue, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
