I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in her long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is clear about her stance on not wanting children. She's been consistent since she was 16, which gives her strong personal reasons. She also made sure past partners didn't want kids before dating them, showing she's proactive about compatibility. Now, with her current boyfriend, she's been in a relationship for over five years. He's been making comments about having kids, which she shuts down. She even told him if that's what he wants, he should leave. \n\nHer boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does. They also mention financial instability\u2014can't afford a small apartment, so having kids would be unreasonable. She prefers having dogs instead of a lifelong responsibility like children. \n\nKey points to consider: Autonomy in relationships is important. People have different values, and it's crucial for partners to align on major life decisions like having kids. The author is upfront and has been with her partner a long time, so he should know her stance by now. However, the boyfriend's mom's disapproval might add pressure. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the relationship; she's honest. The boyfriend has the agency to decide if he can accept her choice. If he wants kids and she never will, maybe the relationship has fundamental incompatibility. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's been consistent and honest, it's more about the boyfriend needing to respect her choice or realize it's not a match. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
