I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids with her boyfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's made sure her past partners knew this, which is good. Her current boyfriend is older. He's been making comments about wanting kids, and she shuts down those conversations. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. Financial reasons and her personal preference for dogs over kids are part of her reasoning.\n\nSo, the main points are: she's been clear about her stance, made it a priority in relationships before, and there are practical reasons like finances. The boyfriend's mom is involved, which might add pressure. The author is firm in her decision.\n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. Well, having kids is a major decision, and it's a personal choice. If both parties are adults, it's important that they agree. The author has made her position clear from the start, so she's not keeping it a secret. The boyfriend might be conflicted, but if she's been upfront, he should be aware. His mom's interference might be complicating things, but the author's stance is valid. She's not forcing him to not have kids; she's stating her own unwillingness. The financial aspect is a valid concern too. So, I think she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
