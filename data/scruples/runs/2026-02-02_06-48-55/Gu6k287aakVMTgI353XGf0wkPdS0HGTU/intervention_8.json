I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is a woman in her mid-20s who has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been against having kids since she was 16, citing reasons like expense, mess, and being too much work. She's been upfront with all her partners about not wanting kids to avoid leading anyone on. Now, her boyfriend, who's older, keeps bringing up the possibility of having kids, and she shuts those conversations down. She even told him once that if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does. They also can't afford kids given their current financial situation, and she wants dogs instead of a lifelong responsibility.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author is clear about her stance on kids from a young age and communicated this to her boyfriend. They've been in a long-term relationship, so he's known her position for a while. However, the boyfriend is bringing up the topic repeatedly, which she's shutting down. She's even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have different values, and not wanting children is a personal choice. The author isn't trying to trick or deceive her partner; she's been upfront. However, relationships require negotiation and compromise. If the boyfriend's desire for children is a deal-breaker for him, then the author's refusal to even consider it might be causing conflict. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fact that she communicated her stance early on suggests she's not leading him on. However, in a long-term relationship, it's possible that the boyfriend's needs or expectations might evolve, and the author's rigid stance without any discussion could be seen as dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons: financial instability, not wanting to take on the responsibility of children, and preferring other pets. The boyfriend's mother's opinion might be adding pressure, but that's not the author's responsibility. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's been honest from the start and the boyfriend knew her position, then she's not wrong for maintaining her stance. However, if the relationship has reached a point where this issue is causing irreconcilable differences, maybe the author should be open to discussing it again, but that's different from being in the wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether she's being dishonest or leading him on, which she isn't. She's clear and upfront. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision, but the question is about the author. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
