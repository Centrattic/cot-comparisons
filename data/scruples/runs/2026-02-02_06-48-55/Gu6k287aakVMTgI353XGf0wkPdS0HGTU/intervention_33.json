I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend wanting them. The author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children and has only dated people who share that view. Now, after five years with her current boyfriend, he's making comments about having kids, and she's shutting down those conversations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been upfront about her stance on kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, which is a significant time. She mentions that they can't afford kids and that she wants dogs instead. The boyfriend's mom is involved, which adds pressure. The author's response is firm, telling him if he wants kids, he should leave. \n\nIs she wrong for being firm? Well, she's honest about her feelings. In relationships, communication is key. If she's been clear all along and the boyfriend hasn't respected that, maybe the problem is on his side. But if he's bringing up the topic repeatedly, maybe she's not addressing his concerns adequately. However, she's not stringing him along; she's making her position known. \n\nFinancial aspects play a role too. They can't afford kids, so her stance is practical. Wanting dogs instead is a personal choice. The boyfriend's family's opinion (his mom) might be influencing him, but that's not necessarily the author's responsibility. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's from a societal expectation that people should want kids. However, the author has her reasons and has been consistent. Relationships require mutual respect. If the boyfriend can't accept her no, then maybe it's his issue. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's being honest and has valid reasons, while the boyfriend might not be respecting her boundaries. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing, like if she's giving him enough room to express his feelings instead of shutting down the conversation. However, she's already made her stance clear, and if he's not respecting that after five years, it's his problem. Therefore, B makes sense.\n"
