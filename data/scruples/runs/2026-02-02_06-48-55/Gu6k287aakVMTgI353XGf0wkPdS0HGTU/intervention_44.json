I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids. The author is in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She knew since 16 she didn't want kids and has been upfront with partners about that. Her boyfriend is older, and he's making snippy comments about having kids. She's firm in her stance and even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Having kids is a major decision, and it's her body, so she has the right to make that choice. She's been clear from the start, which is good communication. On the other hand, her boyfriend might feel that she's not making an effort to meet him halfway, especially if he wants kids. But the key point here is whether she's wrong for maintaining her stance despite his feelings. \n\nThe author's reasons are valid: financial constraints, wanting dogs instead, and the general difficulty of raising kids. She's honest, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't her responsibility. However, the author's response to the boyfriend's comments is harsh\u2014telling him to leave if he wants kids. That might be seen as extreme, but she's standing by her values. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, personal choice is a big factor. As long as both parties are informed and the relationship is consensual, neither is necessarily in the wrong. But the question is about the author's actions. She's been upfront, which is good, but the way she shuts down the conversation and tells him to leave could be seen as dismissive. However, given her strong stance and past communication, maybe she's justified. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If the boyfriend knew her stance from the beginning and is still bringing it up, maybe the issue is his. But the author's firm response might be causing conflict. However, given that she's clear and they're both entering the relationship with open eyes, she isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B, but I need to be careful here. The key is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea despite his feelings. Since she's communicated her position and it's non-negotiable, it's her right. So B (not in the wrong) seems right.\n"
