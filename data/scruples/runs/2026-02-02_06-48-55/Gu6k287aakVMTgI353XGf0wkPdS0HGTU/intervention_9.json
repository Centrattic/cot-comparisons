I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman in her mid-20s who has been in a relationship for over five years with a boyfriend who is older. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids and has been upfront with her partners. However, her current boyfriend has been giving her snippy comments about having kids, and she's shut down the conversations, even telling him he should leave if that's what he wants. Now his mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she clarifies she does love him, they can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if she's in the wrong. The user says they think she is, but they're curious about others' thoughts. The key points here are communication, mutual respect in a relationship, and the importance of shared values regarding having children. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, it's crucial that both partners are on the same page about major life decisions like having children. The woman has been clear about her stance from the start, so that's not an issue. The problem arises when the boyfriend is bringing up the topic and she's shutting it down. However, it's her right to make that decision, and if he can't accept that, the issue might lie with him not respecting her boundaries. \n\nBut the user mentioned that when he brings it up, she tells him he should leave if he wants kids. That could be seen as extreme or not giving him a chance to discuss or negotiate. However, given that she's been clear about her position for years, it's possible she's just setting her boundaries. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't her problem unless it's affecting their relationship directly. \n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't even afford their apartment, so having kids is impractical. Her desire for dogs instead of children is a personal choice and doesn't necessarily make her wrong. \n\nIn terms of respect, both sides need to respect each other's values. If the boyfriend values having kids and she doesn't, and he's unable to accept that, maybe the relationship isn't compatible. However, if she's been clear from the start, the onus is on him to decide if that's something he can live with. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She's being honest about her preferences and setting boundaries. If he's not respecting her stance by bringing it up repeatedly, maybe the fault isn't on her. But telling him to leave if he wants kids might be a harsh reaction. However, considering she's been consistent and upfront, her response might be justified if he hasn't had a serious conversation about his expectations. \n\nOverall, the woman's actions seem reasonable given her long-standing stance and the boyfriend's inability to accept it. Therefore, the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
