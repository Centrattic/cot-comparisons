I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in her relationship. The author is a female in her mid-20s, with a boyfriend she's been with over five years. She's clear she doesn't want kids and has communicated that to him. The boyfriend is older, and he's been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down conversations and even told him to leave if he wants kids. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of this situation. The main issue is about personal choice versus the partner's expectations. The author has been upfront about her stance on children since she was 16 and made sure her partners knew that. That shows she's been honest and not leading someone on. However, the boyfriend has been making comments, which might indicate he hasn't fully accepted her position. She's firm in her decision, which is her right. \n\nBut relationships require mutual respect and acceptance. If the boyfriend hasn't come to terms with her choice, maybe he's not ready for a long-term commitment with someone who doesn't want children. The author's stance is clear, and she's communicated it multiple times. The fact that his mother is involved suggests family pressure, which can be a factor, but the boyfriend should be the one making the decision, not his mom. \n\nFinancial instability is another point. They can't afford an apartment, so having kids would be even more challenging. The author's priorities include wanting dogs, which are different responsibilities but manageable. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It seems like she's being honest and upfront, which is important in relationships. If the boyfriend hasn't respected her boundaries, maybe the problem lies with him. But the question is about her being in the wrong. Since she's been clear and he's not respecting her decision, she's not the one at fault. Her response of telling him to leave if he wants kids is a firm boundary. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
