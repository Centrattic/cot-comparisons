I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The person is a woman in her mid-20s who has known since 16 she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. She always makes sure her partners don't want kids, but he's been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts the conversation down and once told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she claims she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are about personal choice and communication in a relationship. The author has been clear from a young age about her stance on kids. In relationships, she's upfront about her non-negotiable, which is a good practice. However, her current boyfriend is making comments about kids, which suggests he might have different long-term goals. The author's response is firm, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. \n\nBut here's the thing: in a long-term relationship, differences in life goals can lead to conflict. The author has been clear about her position, but if the boyfriend's desire for kids is a fundamental need for him, then there's a mismatch in their goals. The author isn't forcing him to have kids; she's asserting her own choice. However, by being confrontational and telling him to leave, she might be dismissing his feelings or the possibility that he could adjust. \n\nThe boyfriend's mother's opinion is mentioned, but that's not the main issue. The main issue is the couple's differing views on having children. The author isn't in the wrong for having her own preferences, especially since she's communicated them clearly. However, relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If the boyfriend's need for kids is non-negotiable and the author is equally firm, it might be a deal-breaker. The author isn't wrong for sticking to her choice, but the approach to the conflict might need to be more empathetic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility and affordability, the author brings up valid points about their financial situation. Having kids when they can't even afford a small apartment is indeed challenging. She also wants dogs, which is a different responsibility. The question is whether her stance is wrong. Since it's her personal choice and she's being honest, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's frustration is his issue, but the author isn't obligated to have kids. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
