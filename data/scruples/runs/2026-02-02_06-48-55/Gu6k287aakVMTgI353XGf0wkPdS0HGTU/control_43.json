I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids.\n\nThe author is in her mid-20s, has always known she doesn't want kids, and has been upfront with her boyfriend about it. They've been together over five years. He's older and has made snippy comments about kids. She's shut down those conversations, even told him to leave if he wants kids. His mother thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if not wanting kids is a valid reason for being in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has been clear about her stance from the start, even when dating. She's made sure partners knew her preference. That seems responsible.\n\nHer boyfriend is pushing for kids, but she's firm. She's even told him to leave if that's what he wants. That shows she's prioritizing her values and honesty. Financial issues are a real concern, and wanting dogs instead isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother disapproving doesn't reflect the author's actions. The author isn't the one pressuring for kids. The conflict seems to stem from differing life goals. In long-term relationships, differing views on children can be a dealbreaker. Since the author has been upfront and the boyfriend is unhappy, it's a matter of compatibility.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's being honest and making decisions based on her values and circumstances. The boyfriend is the one struggling with her stance, but that's his issue. She's not forcing him into anything. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
