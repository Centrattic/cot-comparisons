I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend wanting them after five years together.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's been clear about not wanting kids since she was 16. She made sure her previous partners also didn't want kids. Now, with her current boyfriend, he's been bringing up the topic, and she's shutting it down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does, and they can't afford kids anyway.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. She's been upfront about her stance on kids. That's important. When entering a relationship, values and goals like having kids are crucial. If she's been honest from the start, that's good. But maybe the boyfriend thought they could compromise or change over time? However, the author has maintained her position for a long time.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that after five years, the topic is a dealbreaker for him. If he's invested in having kids, and she's not willing to even consider it, he might feel neglected or that his needs aren't respected. But she's also clear that she's not open to entertaining the idea, which is her right.\n\nFinancial aspects are another point. They can't afford kids, which adds another layer. The author's argument is practical as well as personal. The boyfriend's mother's opinion might not be the best indicator, but it's possible he feels pressure from her.\n\nIn terms of whether she's in the wrong, it's about mutual respect and communication. If she's been clear and consistent, and the relationship is breaking down because of irreconcilable differences, then it's more of a situational problem rather than her being wrong. The key is that she's not forcing him to stay or being deceptive. She's making her stance known, which is responsible.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's been upfront about her stance, and while the situation is causing tension, it's a matter of differing values rather than her being wrong.\n"
