I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 she doesn't want kids, and she's been upfront with her partners. Now her boyfriend is pushing for kids, and she's shutting down those conversations. He's older, and his mom is involved, thinking she doesn't love him. But she argues they can't afford kids and they both work full-time. She wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The key points are: she's been clear about her stance on kids from the start, which is important because it's a major life decision. She's consistent in her views, which shows she's not being evasive. The boyfriend might feel pressure because it's a common societal expectation, but the author is firm. The boyfriend's mom is taking sides, which could add stress.\n\nFinancial stability is a big factor here. They can't even afford a small apartment, so having kids would be a stretch. The author's reasons are valid\u2014expense, workload. She's also been honest, which is crucial in a relationship. The boyfriend might need to accept her decision, or it's a deal-breaker for him if having kids is non-negotiable.\n\nBut where is the fault? If she's honest and he's not respecting her boundaries, then maybe he's the one in the wrong. However, if she's not considering his feelings or the relationship's future, maybe she's at fault. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The user is asking for an A or B answer.\n\nThe author is being upfront, which is responsible. She's not stringing him along. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision, but the question is about the author. So the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong). Her reasons are valid, she's communicated clearly, and her stance is consistent.\n"
