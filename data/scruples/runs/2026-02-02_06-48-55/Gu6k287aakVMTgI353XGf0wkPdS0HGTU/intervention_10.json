I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in her mid-20s who has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's been giving her snippy comments about having kids, and each time she shuts the conversation down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she maintains she does and they can't afford kids.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But is that accurate? Well, the author has been upfront about her stance on kids from the start of the relationship. That's important because it's about honesty and communication. She's not trying to hide her views; she's making sure her partners know. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is bringing up the topic now after five years. Maybe he hasn't been as clear about his expectations, or perhaps he's not respecting her boundaries. It's a long-term relationship, and differing views on children can be a deal-breaker. The author isn't pressuring him to change her mind, just standing by her choice. The financial aspect is a valid concern too, which adds another layer. So, is she wrong? It seems like she's being honest and direct, which is usually the right approach in relationships. The boyfriend's comments might indicate he's not respecting her firm stance, or maybe he hasn't fully processed his own feelings. The mother's opinion is probably irrelevant here. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
