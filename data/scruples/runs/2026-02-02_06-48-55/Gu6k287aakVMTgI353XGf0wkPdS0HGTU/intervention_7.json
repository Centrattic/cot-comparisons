I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend's family, especially his mom, thinking she doesn't love him because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has consistently made sure her stance is known. She mentions financial constraints and not wanting the responsibility of children, preferring dogs instead. She's direct when the topic comes up, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. Her boyfriend's mom is upset, thinking she doesn't love him, but she does.\n\nNow, evaluating if she's in the wrong. Wanting children is a personal choice, and not wanting them isn't inherently wrong. The author has been upfront about her views from the start of the relationship. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's values. If the boyfriend is okay with not having kids now but his mom is pressuring him, maybe the issue is more about the boyfriend's family's expectations rather than the author's stance. However, if the boyfriend himself is conflicted or wants kids and hasn't addressed it properly, that's on him. The author is being honest and setting boundaries, which is healthy. Financial reasons are also valid. So, the author isn't wrong here. The wrong would be on the boyfriend if he's not respecting her decision, but the question is about the author. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
