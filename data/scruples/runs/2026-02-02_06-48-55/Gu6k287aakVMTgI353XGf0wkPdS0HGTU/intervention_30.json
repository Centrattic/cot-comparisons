I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has never wanted kids, even since she was 16. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's been making comments about having kids, and she's shut those conversations down, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author claims she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting kids from the start of her relationships. She's been upfront with her boyfriend about this since they started dating. The boyfriend is making comments about kids now, and she's firm in her position. The main issue is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids when her boyfriend wants them.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author has communicated her stance multiple times, which is good. But maybe there's a point where being clear isn't enough. The boyfriend's comments and the mother's opinions suggest that there's unresolved tension. The author's response of telling him to leave if he wants kids might be seen as extreme, but it's also a clear boundary. However, relationships require compromise. If the boyfriend is serious about wanting kids and the author is equally serious about not wanting them, it might not be sustainable long-term. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong, not whether the relationship will survive.\n\nFactors to consider: She's been consistent, communicated her position, and the boyfriend is now making it an issue after five years. The financial aspect and her desire for dogs are valid personal reasons. The boyfriend's family is involved, which adds pressure. The author's response is firm, but so is the boyfriend's insistence. The wrong here would depend on whose boundaries are being violated. The author's stance is her right to choose her life path, while the boyfriend's desire for children is also a valid personal choice. However, since she made her position clear from the start, it's the boyfriend's persistence that's problematic. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she's been transparent and upholding her values.\n"
