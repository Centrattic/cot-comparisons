I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has been clear about her stance. He's been making comments about wanting kids, and she's shut down the conversation. She mentioned that if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if her actions are justified. She's been upfront about her no-children stance from the start. That's important because it shows she's honest and not leading someone on. She's also in a long-term relationship, which suggests they've had time to discuss this. The boyfriend is older, so maybe he has different expectations? But she's made her position clear, so if he hasn't respected that, maybe the issue is on his side.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are honesty, communication, and mutual respect. The author communicated her stance early on, which is crucial in a relationship where such a significant decision is involved. She's not pressuring him; in fact, she's shutting down the conversation when he brings it up. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might not be relevant here unless it's causing direct conflict, but the author isn't the one causing that.\n\nFinancial struggles are also a factor. They can't afford kids, which is a legitimate concern. Wanting dogs instead shows her preference for pets but not children. The author hasn't forced the issue; she's standing by her decision. If the boyfriend is pressuring for kids despite her clear stance, that's a problem. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest and setting boundaries. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
