I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and a relationship conflict because of it.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids, which is a significant life decision. She's also communicated this to her partners before, which is good. The boyfriend is older, and he's been getting snippy comments about having kids. She shuts the conversation down each time and even told him to leave if he wants kids. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether not wanting kids makes her the wrong one in the relationship. I know that wanting or not wanting children can be a deal-breaker for some people. The author has been upfront about her stance, which is important in a long-term relationship. The boyfriend's mom's opinion is probably adding pressure, but the core of the problem is the difference in their desires regarding children.\n\nI need to consider if her stance is reasonable. She mentions financial reasons\u2014can't afford a child, they both work full-time, and they can't even afford their apartment. Also, she prioritizes wanting dogs over a lifetime responsibility. These are valid reasons for not wanting kids. However, the boyfriend might see wanting children as essential, especially since he's older and perhaps thinking about the future.\n\nEthically, there's no right or wrong in personal choices about having children. If both parties are aware of each other's positions before committing, it's a mutual decision. The author has been clear, so she's not misleading him. If he's not okay with her decision, maybe the issue is his inability to accept her choice rather than her being wrong. But if the relationship requires compromise on both sides, and she's unwilling to consider it, that could be a point of contention.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the question is about social wrongness, not legal or moral. Here, the author isn't being deceptive; she's honest. The boyfriend might feel unfulfilled, but it's not her fault for having her own convictions. His mom's judgment shouldn't matter either. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to her values and being upfront. The boyfriend might need to accept that if not wanting kids is non-negotiable for her.\n"
