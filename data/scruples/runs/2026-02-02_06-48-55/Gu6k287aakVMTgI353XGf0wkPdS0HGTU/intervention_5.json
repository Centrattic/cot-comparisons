I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman in her mid-20s who's been in a relationship for over five years. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids and has been upfront with her partners. Now, her boyfriend, who's older, is bringing up kids, and she's shutting down the conversation. She's even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her reasoning is that kids are expensive, a lot of work, and they can't afford them. The boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion. Let's break it down. The woman has been clear about her stance on kids from the start. That's important because it shows she's not being deceptive. Honesty in relationships is key. The boyfriend, being older, might have different expectations, but if she communicated her stance early on, he should have considered that. The fact that the relationship has lasted over five years suggests that maybe there were other factors leading to the kid conversation now.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend is bringing up the topic repeatedly. Maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. She's shutting down the conversation each time, which could be a problem. However, she's been consistent and clear. The argument here is about mutual respect. If she's been honest and he's still pushing, maybe he's the one not respecting her decision. The user says she's in the wrong, but maybe that's because they think she should be more flexible. But her reasons are valid\u2014financial constraints, lifestyle preferences. She also mentions wanting dogs instead, which shows her priorities are different.\n\nAnother angle: the mother's perspective. She thinks the author doesn't love the boyfriend, but love isn't just about having kids. The author does love him but can't compromise on this. So, if their core values differ here, maybe the relationship is unsustainable. However, the author isn't forcing him to leave; she's saying if he wants kids, he should leave. That's a strong stance, but she's not being coercive. It's a choice based on her own values.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether her actions are justified. Since she was upfront and the boyfriend is now bringing up a topic she's against, the responsibility might lie more with him not addressing this earlier. However, ending a long-term relationship over this could be seen as harsh. But again, she's made her position clear, and if he's not willing to accept it, maybe it's his fault. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Given that she's been honest and made her stance clear, I'd say she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
