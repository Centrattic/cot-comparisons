I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. She makes sure her partners don't want kids, but he's been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation and even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author asserts she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting kids from a young age. She's been upfront with her partners, which is important in relationships. However, her current boyfriend, who's older, seems to want kids. The author is firm in her position and has communicated it clearly. The boyfriend's mother is involved, which might indicate some pressure from family. The author's response is to shut down the conversation and even suggest he leave if that's what he wants. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, personal choice regarding having children is a significant aspect of autonomy. People have the right to make decisions about their bodies and future, including whether to have children. The author has been consistent in her views and communicates them clearly. That seems responsible. However, in a long-term relationship, differing views on children can lead to conflict. The boyfriend might feel that the author is not considering his desires, but she has communicated her stance clearly from the start.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's persistence might indicate he hasn't respected her boundaries, or perhaps he expected her to reconsider over time. The author's response to tell him to leave if he wants kids could be seen as extreme, but it's also a clear boundary. The fact that they can't afford kids financially adds another layer, as it's a practical concern. The author's desire for dogs instead of children shows her preference for other types of companionship.\n\nIn terms of responsibility in a relationship, both partners need to be on the same page regarding major life decisions like having children. If the author never intended to have kids and made that clear from the beginning, she's not obligated to change her stance. The boyfriend might need to accept that or realize it's not compatible. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own wishes, especially since she's been transparent. However, the way she handles the conflict\u2014shutting down conversations and threatening to end the relationship\u2014might be seen as harsh, but given the long-term nature of the decision, it's a valid stance.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's position seems justified. She's made her preferences clear, which is crucial in a relationship. The boyfriend's dissatisfaction might stem from unmet expectations, but that's his responsibility to address. The author isn't in the wrong for adhering to her values and priorities.\n"
