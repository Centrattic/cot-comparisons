I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The situation is that the author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship. She's always known she doesn't want kids and has been upfront with her boyfriend. Now he's giving her snippy comments about having kids, and she's shutting down the conversation. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear from the start about not wanting kids, so she's not keeping it a secret. The boyfriend is now pushing for kids after five years. That's a significant time in a relationship. The financial aspect is a real issue they mention\u2014they can't even afford their apartment. So having kids would be a stretch. Also, she's been honest, which is important in relationships.\n\nBut wait, maybe the boyfriend expected that his stance on kids might change over time, or maybe he's not being honest himself? The problem is that the author is firm in her decision, and the boyfriend is bringing it up repeatedly. The user is asking if the author is at fault here.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't making the relationship impossible. She's upfront, and if the boyfriend can't accept that, maybe the issue is on his side. However, if the relationship requires compromise and he's not getting that from her, but she's also not willing to budge, then maybe there's a mutual issue. But the author isn't hiding her stance, so she's not wrong for not entertaining the idea. She's prioritizing her autonomy and her financial stability. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might be irrelevant here\u2014family opinions can be stressful but don't define the couple's decisions.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's being honest, and the responsibility here might lie with the boyfriend for not respecting her stance or not being clear about his own needs. The answer should be B (No).\n"
