I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has consistently made her stance on not wanting children clear. She's been upfront from the start, shuts down conversations about kids, and even told him to leave if that's what he wants. Now, her boyfriend and his mom are upset, with the mother thinking she doesn't love him, but the author claims she does, citing financial reasons and personal desires (like wanting dogs instead of kids).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear from a young age about not wanting children, which is a personal choice. She's communicated this to her partners, including her current boyfriend. The boyfriend, however, seems to have unresolved desires for children, which the author is unwilling to accommodate. The boyfriend's mother is involved in the conflict, adding pressure through her belief that the author doesn't love the boyfriend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a personal autonomy standpoint, individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and lives. The author isn't forcing children upon anyone; she's communicated her stance and is sticking to it. However, relationships require mutual respect and compromise. The key here is whether the author's actions are respectful and considerate of her partner's feelings. \n\nShe mentions that she shuts down conversations about kids, which might be seen as dismissive. However, given that she's been clear about her stance for years, it's possible that the boyfriend didn't take her position seriously enough. The author's financial argument (not being able to afford children) is a valid concern, especially if they're struggling with basic expenses like their apartment. Wanting dogs instead of children is a personal preference and doesn't make her wrong in her choice.\n\nBut the conflict arises when the boyfriend feels that his desires aren't being considered. However, the author hasn't agreed to have children and has been transparent. The boyfriend's mother's opinion might be an added pressure, but the author's relationship with her partner is the primary issue. \n\nIs the author wrong for not entertaining the idea? It depends on the context of the relationship. If the boyfriend knew from the start about her stance and is now upset, maybe the issue is his lack of acceptance. But if the author isn't open to revisiting the discussion, that could be a problem. However, the user states that the author has always made her position clear and isn't willing to budge, which is her right. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author isn't forcing the boyfriend into anything. She's made her decision known and isn't manipulating him. The boyfriend's feelings are important, but so is the author's autonomy. Relationships should be built on mutual understanding, so if the boyfriend can't accept her decision, maybe the problem is on his side. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to her values and life choices, especially when they've been communicated upfront.\n"
