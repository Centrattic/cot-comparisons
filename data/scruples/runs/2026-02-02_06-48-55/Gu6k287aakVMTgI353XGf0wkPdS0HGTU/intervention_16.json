I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend's reactions. The author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children and has only dated people who share that view. Now her boyfriend, after five years, is making snippy comments about having kids, and she shut it down, even threatening he should leave if that's what he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been honest from the start, which is important in any relationship. She's made sure partners don't expect kids, which shows she's responsible about her stance. The boyfriend is older, and maybe he's expecting her to change her mind over time. But she's been consistent. \n\nHer reasoning is valid: kids are expensive, a lot of work, and they can't even afford their apartment. She mentions they both work full-time, which adds stress. Also, she wants dogs instead, which is a personal choice. The boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him because of this, but she insists she does. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is the problem here. If he knew from the start she didn't want kids and he's still in the relationship after five years, maybe he should have considered that. The author isn't forcing him to be in the relationship; she's made her position clear. If he's unhappy, the responsibility is on him to decide if he can accept her stance or not. \n\nI think the author is in her rights here. She's been upfront, and if the boyfriend can't accept that after five years, it's his issue. She's not wrong for standing by her decision. Also, financial reasons are a legitimate concern. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
