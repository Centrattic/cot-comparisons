I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has made it clear she doesn't want kids. She felt confident about this since she was 16. The boyfriend, who is older, keeps bringing up the topic, and she shuts down the conversation each time. She even told him he should leave if that's what he wants. Now, the boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't even afford their apartment, so kids are out of the question, and she prefers dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The woman has been clear about her stance on not wanting children for a long time. She's been honest with her boyfriend from the start, making sure he didn't want kids too. That seems responsible because she doesn't want to mislead him. But her boyfriend is bringing up the topic despite her clear boundaries. He might be conflicted or still hoping she'll change her mind. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's been consistent and upfront, then she's not the one being dishonest. However, the boyfriend's feelings and the mother's opinion are part of the context. The boyfriend might feel frustrated that his desires aren't being considered, but if she's already made her position clear, maybe he should have considered that before getting into a long-term relationship. \n\nFinancial instability is another factor. They can't afford their apartment, so having kids would be even more challenging. She mentions wanting dogs instead, which is a different kind of responsibility but less than children. The boyfriend's mom's judgment about her not loving him could be a red flag, but the woman's actions suggest she's committed to the relationship without kids. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, societal opinions might vary. Some might think she's selfish for not wanting kids, but others would support her autonomy in making her own choices. Legally and ethically, unless she's violating any laws or agreements, her decision is her own. Since she's been honest, it's up to the boyfriend to either accept her stance or leave. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the woman isn't in the wrong because she's been clear and consistent. The boyfriend might need to accept her decision or part ways, but that's his choice. Her decision to prioritize her own values and financial reality is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
