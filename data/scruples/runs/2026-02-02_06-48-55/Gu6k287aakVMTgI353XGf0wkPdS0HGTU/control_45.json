I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario (the author of the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves not wanting kids and how that's affecting their relationship with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has always known she didn't want kids and communicated that clearly from the start of her relationships. She's been with her current boyfriend for over five years and has made sure he knows her stance. Now, he's making snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversation. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom is involved, thinking she doesn't love him despite her claims to the contrary. The author argues that they can't afford kids and she prefers dogs instead.\n\nSo, from the author's side, she's been upfront about her child-free choice. That's important because it's a major life decision. She's not keeping it a secret. The boyfriend might have different desires, but if he knew this from the start, why is he bringing it up now? Maybe he's hoping she'll change her mind, but the author is resolute. The financial aspect is a valid point; having kids is expensive, and they can't even afford their apartment. Also, the author's right to make her own life choices without pressure is a factor here.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's mom's opinion that the author doesn't love him because of this could be a red flag. But love is multifaceted. Not wanting kids doesn't negate love. The boyfriend's repeated comments might indicate he hasn't accepted her stance, which could lead to ongoing conflict. However, the author has set boundaries and is clear about her position. She's not forcing him to stay; she's telling him if that's a deal-breaker, he should leave. That seems self-respecting and honest.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of kids? Well, her right to make that choice is personal. Society might pressure people into having kids, but it's her life. As long as she's communicated her stance and the boyfriend knew this before committing, it's his choice to stay or go. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own desires and financial stability. So, probably answer B: No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
