I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and the partner wanting them. The writer is a woman in her mid-20s, been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear about not wanting kids since she was 16. They can't afford kids, and she prefers dogs. The boyfriend is getting snippy comments, and the mom thinks she doesn't love him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if not wanting kids is the author's fault. She's been upfront from the start about her stance. She vetted her partners before, so she's not stringing people along. The boyfriend is older, and maybe he didn't realize her stance would be a deal-breaker. The fact that she's made her position clear multiple times and even told him to leave if kids are important to him suggests she's not inconsiderate. \n\nFinancial instability is a real issue. They can't even afford their apartment, so having kids would be impractical. Also, personal choice plays a role here. People have different values. She wants dogs, not kids. That's her preference. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't her responsibility. The key here is whether the author acted in bad faith. Since she was honest and the boyfriend still has issues, maybe the problem is on his side for not respecting her boundaries. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she's just being true to herself.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She made her position clear and isn't willing to compromise on a major life decision. The boyfriend might need to reconsider if he can accept her stance or if their values are too different.\n"
