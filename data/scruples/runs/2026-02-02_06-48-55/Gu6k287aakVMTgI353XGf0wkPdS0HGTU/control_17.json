I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman in her mid-20s who has been in a five-year relationship with her boyfriend. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids and has always made sure partners didn't want them. Now her boyfriend is making snippy comments about having kids, and she's been shutting down the conversation. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom is upset, thinking she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The main points are her stance on kids, communication in the relationship, and financial considerations. \n\nShe's been clear from the start about not wanting kids, which is good. She's been upfront with her partners, so she's not leading anyone on. Her boyfriend is older, and they've been together five years. The issue now is his comments about kids. She's not entertaining the idea, which might be causing tension. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, if she's been honest from the beginning and the boyfriend knew this, then she's not wrong for sticking to her decision. However, if the boyfriend's expectations have changed or if there's a lack of communication, that's on him. The fact that she's told him directly that if he wants kids he should leave suggests a possible overreaction. Maybe she should have discussed it more to understand his concerns instead of a ultimatum. \n\nBut she's also standing by her values and financial reality. They can't afford kids, so it's not just a personal choice but a practical one. The boyfriend's mom's opinion is external, but the couple's decision should be mutual. \n\nSo, considering all that, she's not in the wrong. She's communicated her stance, made her position clear, and is being realistic. The boyfriend might need to accept that or leave, but she's not wrong for not wanting kids.\n"
