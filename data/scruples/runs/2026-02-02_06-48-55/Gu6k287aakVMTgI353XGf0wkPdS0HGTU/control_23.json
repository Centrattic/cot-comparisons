I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids, and she's been upfront with her partners about this. Her boyfriend is older, and he's been making snippy comments about having kids. She's shut down those conversations, even telling him he should leave if he wants kids. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and the commitment in a long-term relationship. The author made her stance clear from the start, which is good. She's been upfront about not wanting kids, so she's not stringing him along. However, in a long-term relationship, especially after five years, there might be expectations beyond just initial preferences. But the boyfriend hasn't left, which could suggest he's accepted her position, even if he's unhappy. \n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea. From a personal choice standpoint, she has every right to decide not to have kids. However, if the boyfriend's desire for children is a non-negotiable, then the incompatibility is on his side. The author's firmness might seem harsh, but she's been clear. The mother's judgment is an external factor but not directly the author's fault.\n\nFinancial stability is another point. They can't even afford their apartment, so having kids is impractical. Her preference for dogs shows she wants companionship without the long-term responsibility of children. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about whether she's respectful. She told him directly if he wants kids, he should leave. That's a strong stance, but it's her right to set boundaries. The boyfriend should have known her stance early on, and if he's still with her, maybe he's accepted it despite his issues. So, she's not in the wrong because she communicated her position clearly and the decision is mutual. The conflict lies in the boyfriend not respecting her choice, not her. So the answer is B.\n"
