I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she's been with her boyfriend for over five years and she's made it clear from the start that she doesn't want kids. He's been making comments about having kids, and she's shut those conversations down. She even told him to leave if that's what he wants. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. They also can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. She's been upfront about not wanting kids since she was 16. She ensures potential partners don't want kids either. The boyfriend is older, so maybe he expected kids? But she's been clear from the start. However, after five years, maybe the boyfriend's feelings have changed or he's more invested. She's being firm, but maybe he's feeling unheard or pressured.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's been honest from the beginning, that's a strong point in her favor. People have the right to choose if they want kids or not. But maybe the problem is that over time, the boyfriend's perspective changed, and he wants kids now. If she's not open to changing her stance, that could be an issue. However, she's made it clear she doesn't want kids, so he might have known from the start. \n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't afford kids, which adds to her stance being reasonable. She also wants dogs, which is a personal preference. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't directly relevant unless it's causing conflict. \n\nBut maybe she's being dismissive of his feelings. If he's been making snippy comments and she shuts down the conversation, maybe there's a communication issue. However, she's standing by her decision, which is her right. The question is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea. Since she's been consistent and upfront, it's her life choice. So I think she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
