I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman in her mid-20s with a 5-year relationship who's adamant about not having kids. She's clear from a young age that she doesn't want children, and she's been upfront with her boyfriend. But he keeps bringing up the topic, and she shuts it down. He might be getting frustrated, and his mom thinks she doesn't love him. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman has known her stance on kids since 16, which is pretty clear. She's been honest with her boyfriend from the start, ensuring he doesn't want kids too. That's important because compatibility in big life decisions like having children is crucial. But the boyfriend is still bringing it up, and she's firm in her decision. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's perspective might be that after 5 years, he's expecting her to reconsider. Maybe he feels hurt or wants to have kids with her. However, the woman's reasons are practical and emotional\u2014cost, responsibility, not wanting to string him along. She's also mentioned their financial situation, which adds weight to her argument that having kids isn't feasible.\n\nThe user's comment about the boyfriend's mom thinking she doesn't love him is another angle. But love isn't just about wanting kids; it's about mutual respect and accepting each other's boundaries. If the boyfriend can't accept her stance on children, maybe the issue is about his own expectations versus hers.\n\nI should check if there's any red flags. The woman isn't being inconsiderate; she's communicated her feelings clearly. She's even said if he wants kids, he should leave. That's a strong statement but shows she's serious. However, pushing someone away like that might come off as harsh. But given her history of being upfront, she's not keeping it a secret. \n\nThe boyfriend's persistence might indicate he's not respecting her boundaries. In a healthy relationship, both parties should accept each other's non-negotiables. If he can't accept her no, then the problem might be on his end. The woman isn't in the wrong if she's been clear and consistent. Her reasons are valid, and she's not forcing him to stay. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). She's communicated her stance, and if the boyfriend can't accept that, the issue lies with him. Relationships require compromise, but when one partner's dealbreaker is non-negotiable, the fault isn't on the person holding the line.\n"
