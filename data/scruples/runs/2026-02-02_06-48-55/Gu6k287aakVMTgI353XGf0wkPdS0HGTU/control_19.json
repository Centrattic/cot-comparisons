I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and a long-term boyfriend making comments about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has known since 16 she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and he's older. She's been clear about her stance, even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. He's getting snippy comments, and his mom thinks she doesn't love him. The author argues that they can't afford kids, both work full-time, and she prefers dogs.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the main factors here are communication and mutual respect. The author has been upfront about her feelings on kids from the start, which is responsible. She's in a long-term relationship where both are in agreement. The boyfriend's comments might be about his own feelings, but if the author has made her position clear, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. Also, the mom's opinion isn't the author's responsibility. Financial stability is another point; they can't afford kids, so it's a practical consideration. The author's preference for dogs vs. kids is a personal choice. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to accept each other's deal-breakers. Since the author has communicated clearly and the boyfriend is now making snippy remarks, maybe he's the one not respecting her stance. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
