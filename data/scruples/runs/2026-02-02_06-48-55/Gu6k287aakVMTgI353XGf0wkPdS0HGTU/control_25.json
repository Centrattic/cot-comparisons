I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is a female in her mid-20s who has known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. Every time he brings up the possibility of having kids, she shuts the conversation down. She even told him once that if he wants kids, he should leave because she won't have them. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. They can't afford kids, both work full-time, and they can't even afford their small apartment. She wants dogs instead.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids. The possible answers are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not wrong). I need to figure out the right answer based on the given information.\n\nFirst, let's break down her reasoning. She's made her stance clear since a young age, which is a long time. She's been upfront with her boyfriends about not wanting kids, which is good communication. In this case, she's been with her boyfriend for over five years, so he should know her position. She's firm in her decision and even told him to leave if he wants kids, which is a strong statement. Her reasons include financial instability (can't afford their apartment, so kids would be unreasonable), the workload, and her preference for dogs. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's side isn't fully explained here. We don't know why he wants kids, but the fact that he keeps bringing it up after five years suggests he might not be satisfied with the current situation. However, the user's argument is that she's being clear and they're in an apartment they can't afford. So from her perspective, she's not being inconsiderate; she's standing by her decision and communicating it. \n\nThe debate here is about whether it's fair to expect someone not to want kids if that's a core part of their identity. Since she's known since 16 and is upfront, it's her right to make that choice. However, some might argue that telling him to leave is harsh, but in a long-term relationship where this has been discussed multiple times, it could be seen as a necessary boundary. \n\nFinancial concerns are a common reason people choose not to have kids. If they can't afford their current lifestyle, adding a child would be a significant burden. Also, she mentions wanting dogs instead, which is a personal preference. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion might be irrelevant, as the decision is between the couple. The key issue is mutual respect for each other's values. If the boyfriend is aware of her stance and continues to push, maybe he needs to consider if he's willing to live without kids. \n\nIn terms of social norms, having kids is often expected, but it's a personal choice. The user is not forcing him into a relationship but is being clear about her non-negotiables. So unless there's a betrayal or a broken promise regarding the kids, she's not in the wrong. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should be more open-minded or consider having kids in the future. But she hasn't wavered in her decision. Also, the comment about him leaving if he wants kids is a strong stance. Some might say that's extreme, but if it's a deal-breaker for her, it's her prerogative.\n\nOverall, I think the user is not in the wrong. She's communicated her position clearly, has valid reasons, and is maintaining her boundaries. So the answer would be B.\n"
