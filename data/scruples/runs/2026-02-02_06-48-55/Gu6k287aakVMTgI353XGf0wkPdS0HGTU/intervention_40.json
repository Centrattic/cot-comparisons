I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down the conversation with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the author has been in a relationship for over five years. She's been clear since her mid-teens that she doesn't want kids. She's made sure her past partners were on board to avoid leading them on. That shows she's been consistent and upfront about her stance.\n\nThe boyfriend is older, and he's been making comments about having kids. The author responds by shutting down the conversation, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They also mention they can't afford kids and prefer dogs.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But why? Let me analyze. The author has communicated her stance early and maintained it. The boyfriend hasn't been satisfied, but the author isn't the one changing her mind. She's not forcing him to stay; she's giving him a choice. The issue here might be about the boyfriend's expectations versus her boundaries. \n\nFinancial stability and personal preferences (like wanting dogs) are valid reasons. The author isn't being deceptive; she's honest from the start. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might be influencing him, but that's their family dynamic. The problem seems more on the boyfriend's side for not respecting her decision, but the author has a right to her own life choices. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to align on major issues like having kids. If they can't agree, it's a dealbreaker. The author isn't in the wrong for standing her ground. So the answer should be B.\n"
