I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong regarding not wanting kids. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 she doesn't want kids, communicates that clearly in relationships, and made sure her current boyfriend also doesn't want kids. But her boyfriend is older and has been giving her snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down those conversations and once told him to leave if he wants kids. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, have a small apartment, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate based on the situation. From what's described, the author has been upfront about her stance on kids since the beginning. She's made sure her partner shares her views. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is bringing up the topic despite her clear boundaries. It seems like the boyfriend might be the one not respecting her decision here. The fact that he's been making snippy comments and his mom is involved suggests there's pressure from his side. The author is firm in her decision, which is valid. People have different values and priorities, and not wanting kids is a personal choice. The key here is whether the author is being unfair. Since she communicated her stance early and both partners agree on no kids, but the boyfriend's comments are causing tension, the fault might lie with him for not respecting her position. Financial reasons and lifestyle preferences are also valid factors. So, the author isn't in the wrong; she's standing by her choice, and the boyfriend's reaction is the issue. The answer should be B.\n"
