I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in a long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in her mid-20s who's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. She's been upfront about her stance, making sure past partners didn't want kids. Now, her boyfriend keeps bringing up kids, and she's shut down the conversation, even saying if that's what he wants, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author insists she does. They can't afford kids and prefer dogs instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she's been clear about her position from the start, the relationship has lasted five years, and there's a financial argument against having kids. She's also been consistent in her choice. The boyfriend is still pushing for it despite her clear boundaries. The boyfriend's mom is involved, which adds another layer of pressure.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about personal choice and communication. She's made her stance clear and isn't changing her mind. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for continuing to bring it up and not respecting her boundaries. The mother's judgment doesn't matter if the boyfriend isn't respecting his partner's wishes. Also, financial stability is a valid concern. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's standing by her decision and being honest. The boyfriend might need to accept her choice or realize it's not compatible. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
