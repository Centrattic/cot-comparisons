I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being in a long-term relationship, being clear about not wanting kids from a young age, and her boyfriend making snippy comments about having children. She's shut down those conversations and even told him he should leave if he wants kids. The boyfriend's mom is involved, thinking the author doesn't love him, but the author claims she does love him but can't see having kids being feasible financially or personally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting kids since she was 16. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has made sure that each partner she's been with doesn't want kids. That seems like she's been upfront and honest about her preferences, which is important in relationships. The boyfriend is older, and he's making comments about having kids, which she's shutting down. She's even told him directly that if he wants kids, he should leave. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, especially long-term ones, having children is a significant decision that both partners need to agree on. If one partner is firmly against it, and the other is not, that can create tension. The author has been clear from the start, so she's not hiding her views. However, after five years, the boyfriend is bringing it up more, which might indicate that his feelings have changed or he's more insistent now. The author is firm in her stance, which could lead to conflict. \n\nThe author's arguments are based on her personal values and practical considerations (cost, responsibility, wanting dogs instead). She's also considering the financial aspect, which is a valid concern. The boyfriend's mother's opinion is part of the equation, but the author's feelings for her boyfriend are still there, just not the desire for kids. \n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. In many cases, being upfront about such a significant life choice is considered responsible. However, after a long relationship, if one partner's desires change or become more pressing, the other partner's refusal might be seen as not being considerate. But the author has consistently maintained her position. The boyfriend's comments are snippy, which might indicate frustration, and her response of telling him to leave if he wants kids is strong. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author isn't hiding her views, so she's not being deceptive. However, relationships require compromise. If she's unwilling to even consider it, and the boyfriend is increasingly wanting it, that could lead to the relationship not being sustainable. But is that her fault? She's being honest, which is right, but maybe not considering her partner's feelings? However, the boyfriend is also bringing up the topic repeatedly, which might be his way of testing her stance or expressing his own frustrations. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person was honest, whether they acted in bad faith, or if they've wronged the other person. The author seems honest, so she's not in the wrong for that. However, the boyfriend's feelings are hurt, but that might be a result of his own desires conflicting with hers. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because she's been clear and honest, and making a significant life decision like having kids requires mutual agreement. If one person is against it from the start and remains so, it's not their fault for not entertaining the idea. The boyfriend's frustration is his issue, but she's not wrong for setting boundaries."
