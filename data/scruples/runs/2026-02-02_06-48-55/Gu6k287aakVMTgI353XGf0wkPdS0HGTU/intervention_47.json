I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not considering having kids. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's always been against having kids, has communicated this clearly, and now he's giving her snippy comments about it. She's firm in her stance because of financial reasons and personal preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been upfront about her stance from the start. She made sure past partners were on the same page. Now her boyfriend is pushing for kids, which she's resisting. She even told him if he wants kids he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author claims she does.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to make personal life choices, including child-free. The author isn't forcing anyone; she's communicated her position clear. However, in a long-term relationship, differing values can cause conflict. The boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being considered, but the author isn't making him a parent against his will; she's just not compromising. \n\nFinancial reasons are valid. The couple can't even afford a small apartment, so having kids would be a huge burden. The author's desire for dogs instead of children shows her priorities are clear. The boyfriend might need to accept her stance or realize their future isn't aligned. \n\nIs it the author's fault for being honest? Probably not. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's values. If the boyfriend can't accept her no-kids stance after five years, maybe the issue is his inability to accept her for who she is. The author isn't wrong for upholding her beliefs. So, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
