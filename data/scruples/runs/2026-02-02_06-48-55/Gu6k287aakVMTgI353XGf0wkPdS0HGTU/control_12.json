I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's been making snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts down those conversations. She even told him to leave if he wants kids because she won't do it. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been upfront about her stance on having kids from the start of the relationship. She ensures potential partners don't want kids to avoid hurting them. In this case, she's been with her boyfriend for over five years, which is a significant amount of time. The boyfriend, however, hasn't left despite her clear boundaries. He's bringing up the topic repeatedly, which she finds annoying. She's firm in her decision, and he's upset about it, even his mom getting involved.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to make personal decisions about their bodies and lives. If she's been clear and honest, and the boyfriend hasn't respected her boundaries or hasn't chosen to leave despite her firm stance, the responsibility isn't on her. He's the one who hasn't walked away, even after she told him to. His mom's opinion is also a red herring because the decision to have kids is between the couple, not the family. Financial instability is another factor; they can't afford a child, which adds to the impracticality. Her preference for dogs over kids is a valid personal choice as well.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she's being selfish by not considering his desire for children. But if she's never considered having kids and he's only now expressing strong feelings about it, maybe there's an issue with communication or timing. But given that she's been upfront all along, and he hasn't left, it's more about his inability to accept her choice rather than her being wrong. The fact that they've been together for five years suggests they've built a life together without kids, which could be a point in her favor. Also, the financial aspect is a real concern, making having a child unfeasible.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's being honest and consistent, and the boyfriend hasn't respected her boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
