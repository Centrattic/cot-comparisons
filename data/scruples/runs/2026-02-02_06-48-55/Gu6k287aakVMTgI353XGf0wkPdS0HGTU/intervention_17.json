I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids, given the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, in a 5-year relationship with a boyfriend older than her. She's been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids, for practical reasons like cost, effort, and personal preference. She's been upfront with her partners about this, which is good. However, her boyfriend keeps bringing up the topic, and she ends the conversation each time, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. His mom is involved, thinking the author doesn't love him, which adds tension.\n\nThe core issue here is whether not wanting kids makes the author in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, personal choice is a big factor. People have different values and life goals. If both partners aren't aligned on major issues like having children, it can lead to conflict. The author has been honest from the start, which is crucial in relationships. But the boyfriend's persistence might indicate he hasn't been equally clear about his expectations, or maybe he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nThe key points are: the author communicated her stance early, the boyfriend hasn't accepted it, leading to ongoing tension. The boyfriend's mother's opinion might be clouding their judgment, but that's a separate issue. The author is being clear, which is responsible. However, the relationship's foundation should be mutual respect and compatibility. If the boyfriend can't accept a fundamental aspect of her life, maybe the relationship isn't sustainable. \n\nBut should the author be in the wrong? It's more about compatibility than right or wrong. Choosing not to have kids isn't inherently wrong. The problem arises if one partner is pressuring the other against their will. The author is standing by her choice, which is her right. However, if the boyfriend is unhappy with this, maybe he's not the right partner. The author isn't wrong for sticking to her values and being upfront. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
