I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids. The situation is that the author has been clear about not wanting kids since she was 16, and she's been with her boyfriend for over five years. He's been making comments about kids, and she's shut down the conversation. She even told him to leave if that's what he wants. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she argues she does, citing financial reasons and her preference for dogs over kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if not wanting kids is wrong. The user is asking for a judgment based on the given info. The author has been upfront about her stance since the start of the relationship. That's important because it shows she's been honest. People have different values, and some might see having kids as important, but others don't. The author's reasoning includes financial issues and personal preference. Both are valid reasons.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't the main issue here. The key is the relationship between the author and her boyfriend. The author is clear she doesn't want kids, and she's communicated this. She's also made it clear that if the boyfriend wants kids, he should leave. That's a strong stance, but given the time they've been together and her consistent communication, it's her right to set boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's persistence in bringing up the topic might indicate he hasn't accepted her decision, which could lead to conflict. However, the author isn't wrong for not changing her mind. Relationships require mutual respect, and if the boyfriend can't respect her choice, maybe the relationship isn't right for both. \n\nFinancial stability is another point. They can't afford a child, which is a practical reason. Some might argue that financial issues can be managed, but in this case, they can't even afford their apartment. That's a significant factor. \n\nDogs as a preference over kids is a personal choice. People have different priorities. The author's choice isn't harmful; it's just her personal decision. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's been honest, communicated her stance, and given valid reasons. The boyfriend's frustration is his issue, but the author isn't obligated to change her views. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
