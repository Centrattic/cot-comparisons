I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been clear about this with her boyfriend, who's older, and they've been together for over five years. She shuts down conversations about kids when he brings it up and even told him to leave if that's what he wants. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants a dog instead.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and mutual expectations in a relationship. The author was upfront from the start about not wanting kids, which is important. However, the boyfriend is bringing up the topic, which suggests there's a conflict in their desires. The author is firm in her stance, which might be causing tension. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids despite the relationship's longevity.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial for both partners to have aligned major life goals, like having children. If someone has made their stance clear from the beginning, they're not necessarily in the wrong for sticking to it. However, after five years, maybe the boyfriend expects some compromise, but the author is non-negotiable. The issue might be about the boyfriend not respecting her boundaries or her not being open to discussion. But since she's been clear and they haven't resolved this, it's a matter of conflicting values. The author's actions seem justified if she's communicated her stance and the relationship can't accommodate that. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because she's honest and consistent about her beliefs, even if it leads to the relationship not working out.\n"
