I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she's in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years, and has made it clear she doesn't want kids. She's been upfront from the start, but her boyfriend keeps bringing up kids, and she shuts it down. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman has been clear and consistent about her stance on not wanting kids since she was 16. She makes sure her partners share that view before dating. Now, with her long-term boyfriend, he's older and has been bringing up the topic, but she's been shutting it down. The boyfriend's mom is involved, which might be adding pressure.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is wrong, but they're seeking a different perspective. The main issue here is whether not entertaining the idea of kids is wrong in a relationship where both partners have been together for over five years. \n\nI should consider the context of long-term relationships and differing life goals. If both partners are in a committed relationship, having conflicting views on having children can be a significant issue. However, the woman has been transparent from the beginning, which is important. The boyfriend might be conflicted because he's in a long-term relationship but hasn't had this conversation earlier. The key points are communication and mutual expectations. \n\nIf she's been upfront and he's still in the relationship, maybe it's his fault for not addressing it earlier. But if he's been trying to bring it up and she's shutting it down, maybe she's not being communicative. However, she's clear she doesn't want kids, and the boyfriend's mother is involved, which complicates things. \n\nAlso, financial aspects are mentioned; they can't afford kids, which is a practical concern. Her wanting dogs instead shows her preference for pets over children, which is a valid choice. \n\nIn many cases, having children is a major life decision, and both partners need to be on the same page. If she's been clear and consistent, she's not necessarily wrong. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her stance or for taking it to his mother. \n\nBut the user thinks she's wrong, so there's a difference in perspective. The core question is whether not even entertaining the idea is wrong. Some might argue that in a long-term relationship, both partners should be willing to consider each other's desires, but if it's a non-negotiable for her, then it's about mutual respect. \n\nSo, based on the information, the author has been upfront, and the boyfriend might have known this but is now pressuring her. The mother's involvement could be external pressure. The woman has valid reasons (cost, responsibility) and has made her position clear. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
