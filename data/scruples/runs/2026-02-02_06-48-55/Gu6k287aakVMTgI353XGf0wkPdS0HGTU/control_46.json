I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear since she was 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's made sure her partners knew that, but her current boyfriend is bringing up the topic and she's shutting it down, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she asserts she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and whether she's being unfair. She's been upfront about her stance on kids from the start, which is important in a long-term relationship. It's mentioned that she's made sure previous partners were on the same page. Now, with her current boyfriend, he's bringing up the topic, but she's not entertaining it. She's even told him to leave if that's what he wants. \n\nThe boyfriend's mother's opinion might not be relevant unless the boyfriend himself is being pressured by his mom, but the main issue is between the boyfriend and the author. The author's reasons are financial (they can't afford kids), personal choice (she wants dogs), and the fact that she's clear about her position. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial that both partners agree on major life decisions, like having kids. If one partner is adamant against it, and the other is considering it, that's a significant issue. The author isn't forcing kids on him; she's stating her position. However, the boyfriend might feel that by not entertaining the idea, she's not being open to discussion. But the author's stance is firm, and she's communicated this clearly. \n\nThe question is whether her being firm and not considering compromise is wrong. If the boyfriend can't accept her position after five years, maybe the problem is on his side for not aligning with her values. However, some might argue that she's not giving him a chance to work towards a solution, but given her financial constraints and personal preferences, it's not just about being open to discussion\u2014it's about personal values.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key is whether she's being disrespectful or dishonest. Since she's been clear from the beginning, it's not her fault if the boyfriend can't accept that. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
