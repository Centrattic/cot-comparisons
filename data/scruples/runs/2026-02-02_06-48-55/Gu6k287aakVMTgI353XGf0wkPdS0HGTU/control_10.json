I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman in her mid-20s who has been in a five-year relationship with her boyfriend, who is older. She's been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids, and she's made sure her partners know that. Now, her boyfriend is making snippy comments about having kids, and she's shut those conversations down. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, which adds another layer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been consistent about her stance on not wanting kids since she was 16. She's made this clear to her partners, which is responsible. The boyfriend's mom is involved, suggesting that there's pressure from his side. The financial aspect is also mentioned\u2014both work full-time and can't afford even a small apartment, making kids seem unreasonable. She also mentions wanting dogs instead of a lifetime responsibility, which is a personal preference.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The main factors here are communication, mutual respect, and relationship expectations. The author has communicated her stance clearly. The boyfriend, however, is bringing up the topic repeatedly, which might indicate that he hasn't accepted her position. If the boyfriend is in the relationship knowing her stance but still pressures her, that could be problematic. However, it's also about whether the author is being respectful in shutting down the conversation and telling him to leave if he wants kids.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, it's important for both partners to have aligned values. If having children is a non-negotiable for the boyfriend, and the author is equally firm in not wanting them, this could be a deal-breaker. The author isn't wrong for being honest about her preferences. However, the way she handles the situation\u2014telling him to leave if that's his desire\u2014might be seen as harsh, but it's a direct way of setting boundaries. The boyfriend's mom's opinion adds external pressure, but the author's feelings and values should take precedence in the relationship.\n\nFinancial stability is another factor. The author's argument about not being able to afford kids is valid. Responsible planning is necessary, and expecting someone to take on financial strain against their will isn't fair. The author's focus on wanting dogs instead is a personal choice, which is reasonable as long as it's her decision.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for being clear about her desires. The issue might lie with the boyfriend's expectations and his inability to respect her boundaries. Relationships require compromise, but when core values clash, it's not necessarily the person's fault for not changing their stance. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
