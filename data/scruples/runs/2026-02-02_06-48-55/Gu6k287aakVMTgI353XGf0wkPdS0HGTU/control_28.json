I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in their relationship. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids because of the cost, effort, etc. She's made her stance clear to her boyfriend and others, even telling him to leave if he wants kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is upfront about her views on children. She's been consistent since her teens, which is a long time. In a long-term relationship, communication is crucial. She's communicated her stance, and her boyfriend is older. The boyfriend's mother thinks she doesn't love him, but the author maintains she does. They also mention financial strain and her preference for dogs. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's at fault. From an ethical standpoint, someone isn't wrong for having personal values and making them clear. The issue here is mutual compatibility. If the boyfriend wants kids and she doesn't, maybe they're not compatible long-term. But the author is taking a firm stance, which could be seen as not considering the other person's wishes. However, she's been consistent and communicated it from the start.\n\nSome might argue that she's being selfish by not entertaining the idea, but others would say it's her right to make that choice. The fact that she's been upfront is in her favor. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't relevant to the main question. The financial aspect adds another layer, supporting her decision. \n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. She's made her intentions clear, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend might need to accept that or realize it's a deal-breaker. The answer should be B (No).\n"
