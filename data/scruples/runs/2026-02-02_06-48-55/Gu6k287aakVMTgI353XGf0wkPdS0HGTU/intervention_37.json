I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in a long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has been clear about not wanting children since she was 16. She's made sure her partners knew this before dating them. Now, in a 5-year relationship, her boyfriend is giving her comments about having kids. She shuts the conversation down and told him to leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author does love him but can't see having kids due to financial reasons and personal preferences.\n\nThe main points here are about communication and mutual respect. The author has been upfront about her stance on kids. However, in a long-term relationship, especially one lasting over five years, it's important to address such significant differences in values. The boyfriend's comments suggest he might be reconsidering or expecting a change, but the author hasn't engaged in a deeper discussion. Instead, she's been shutting down the conversation, which could lead to resentment. While her stance is valid, not addressing his concerns and using a \"you should leave\" approach might be seen as dismissive. The author's refusal to even discuss it could be harmful, especially if the boyfriend feels unheard or unvalued. Relationships require compromise and understanding both partners' perspectives. By not entertaining the idea and being confrontational, the author might be neglecting the emotional needs of her partner, which is a key part of a healthy relationship. So, while her decision not to have kids is her choice, the way she's handling the situation might be where she's in the wrong.\n"
