I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship with a boyfriend who's older. She's been clear since 16 that she doesn't want kids, and she's made sure her partners knew that. Now her boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids, and when it comes up, she shuts the conversation down. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave because she won't do it. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been upfront about her stance on children from the start of the relationship. That's a big point in her favor because being honest about such a major life decision is important in relationships. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is bringing up the topic repeatedly and making snippy comments, which could indicate that he hasn't respected her boundaries. If he knew from the beginning that she didn't want kids, and he's only now starting to push the issue, that might be where the issue lies. However, maybe their relationship has evolved, and his feelings about wanting kids have changed over time. But the author hasn't changed her stance, so if he's not comfortable with that, maybe the problem is his continued insistence despite her clear boundaries.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, but that's more about others' opinions rather than the couple's dynamic. Financial stability is a factor here\u2014she mentions they can't afford an apartment and have full-time jobs. Children are expensive, so her reasoning about affordability is valid. The author is also clear about her priorities (dogs over children), which is part of her personal choice.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is taking her decision seriously by not stringing people along if they disagree. However, the boyfriend might feel that the relationship is moving forward, and his desire for kids is becoming more pressing. But if he knew her stance from the start, he might need to reevaluate his own expectations. The key here is whether the author has been consistent and honest, which she has, versus the boyfriend not respecting her boundaries now. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because she was upfront about her choice from the beginning and has been clear about not wanting to change her stance. The boyfriend's issue might stem from not respecting her boundaries or not being prepared to accept her decision, which would place him in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
