I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend being upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author has always known she didn't want kids since 16. She's clear with partners about this, which is good. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's bringing up kids, but she shuts the conversation down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids and she prefers dogs.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author is upfront about her stance on kids, which is important in a relationship. She's been consistent. The boyfriend is now pressuring her, but she's clear it's a deal-breaker. Financial issues are a real concern, and her choice is valid. People have different values, and not wanting kids is a personal choice. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not forcing him to leave; he's choosing to stay. She's not lying about her feelings. The boyfriend might be frustrated, but it's his choice to be in a relationship where having kids isn't an option. The mother's opinion isn't relevant here. So, the author isn't wrong. Her choice is her own, and she's honest. The answer should be B.\n"
