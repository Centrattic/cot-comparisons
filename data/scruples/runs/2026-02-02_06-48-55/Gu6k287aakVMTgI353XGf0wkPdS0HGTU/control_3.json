I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is wrong for not wanting kids. The situation is the author has been in a relationship for over five years and has consistently made it clear they don't want children. They've communicated this from the start, even when dating others. Now their boyfriend, who is older, is giving them the \"AITA\" treatment for not entertaining the idea.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is female in her mid-20s, has been clear about not wanting kids since age 16. They've had this conversation with their boyfriend and others, and he's been making snippy comments. The author shut the conversation down each time and even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Their finances are tight, and they want dogs instead.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I know, people have different values and priorities. Not wanting kids is a personal choice that doesn't inherently make someone wrong. The author has been upfront about their stance, which is important in relationships. The boyfriend's comments might indicate a mismatch in values, especially since he's been in the relationship for so long but now is bringing this up. However, if the boyfriend wanted kids but the author has consistently said no, that's a valid conflict. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend's reaction might be the issue here. If he's been making snippy comments and his mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author clearly states they do love him, there's a communication problem. However, the author's stance is consistent and communicated early. The boyfriend might need to accept that or realize they're incompatible. The author isn't wrong for standing by their choice, especially when it's been clear from the start. Financial reasons and wanting other pets also are valid personal choices. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made their position clear, and the conflict arises from differing values that weren't respected. The responsibility isn't on the author to change their stance if it's been communicated.\n"
