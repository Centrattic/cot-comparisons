I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's been making snippy comments about having kids, and each time she shuts the conversation down. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave because she won't do that. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does. They can't afford kids, work full-time, and can't even afford their small apartment. She wants dogs instead of a lifetime responsibility.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author is clear about her stance on not wanting kids and has communicated this to her boyfriend. She's been consistent since they started dating, making sure he doesn't want kids either. That seems responsible because she's not stringing him along. However, the boyfriend is making comments about wanting kids, and the author is firm in her position. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that the author is being dismissive or not considering his desires, especially since they've been together for five years. The mother's perspective is that the author doesn't love him, but the author says she does. The financial aspect is a real issue here, and she's making a valid point about affordability. Also, wanting dogs instead of kids shows her preference for different types of commitment.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to have aligned or at least compatible long-term goals. If the author is upfront about not wanting kids from the start, and the boyfriend still chose to continue the relationship, he might have accepted that. However, if the boyfriend's desire for kids is a deal-breaker for him, then the author's stance is justified in not compromising. \n\nBut maybe the issue is that the author is not even entertaining the idea, which could be seen as not being open to compromise. However, if she's never wavered and has communicated it clearly, then she's not being inconsiderate. The boyfriend should have addressed this earlier in the relationship if it was a deal-breaker. The fact that they've been together for five years suggests that he might not have made his stance clear on this issue either.\n\nFinancial concerns are a valid reason not to have kids, and wanting dogs instead is a personal choice. The author isn't forcing the boyfriend to not have kids; she's just making it clear that she won't participate. So, in terms of fault, it's hard to say the author is in the wrong. She's being honest and consistent. The boyfriend might be in the wrong if he's now realizing that his desire for kids conflicts with hers after five years together without addressing it earlier.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
