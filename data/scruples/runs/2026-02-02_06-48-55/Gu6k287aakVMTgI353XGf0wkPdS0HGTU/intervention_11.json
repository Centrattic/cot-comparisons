I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in a long-term relationship. The author made her stance clear from a young age, communicates it to her partners, and is now in a 5+ year relationship. Her boyfriend is older, and he's making snippy comments about kids. She shuts down conversations and even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids and prefer dogs.\n\nFirst, the author has been upfront about her no-children stance since she was 16. That's a long time, so she's not hiding her views. She makes sure her partners know this before getting serious, which is responsible. In a long-term relationship, communication is key. She's been clear with her boyfriend, which is important. However, her response to his comments is a bit harsh. Telling him to leave if he wants kids might be too extreme, as relationships require compromise. But given that she's been upfront, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't afford kids, so it's a practical consideration. Her preference for dogs over kids is personal. The boyfriend's mother's opinion might be causing tension, but that's her family's issue. The question is whether the author is wrong for not entertaining the idea. Since she's communicated her stance and there's no coercion, she's probably not in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to accept this or decide if he can live without kids. So the answer is B.\n"
