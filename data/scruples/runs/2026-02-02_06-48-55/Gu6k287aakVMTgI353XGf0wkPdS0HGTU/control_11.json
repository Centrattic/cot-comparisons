I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since 16 that she doesn't want kids and has been upfront with partners about it. Her boyfriend, who's older, has made snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts those conversations down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she claims she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to decide if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her being clear about her stance on kids from the start, the boyfriend's persistence despite her clear position, and the financial aspect. She's been consistent in her choice, which is a personal decision. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't her responsibility, and financial constraints are a valid reason. The boyfriend might be unhappy, but she's not obligated to change her stance. So the author's actions seem justified. The answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
