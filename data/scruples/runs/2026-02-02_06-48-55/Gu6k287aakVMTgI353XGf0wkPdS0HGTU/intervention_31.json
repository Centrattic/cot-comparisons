I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. She's been clear about not wanting kids, and she's made sure her partners in the past didn't want kids either. Now, her boyfriend is making snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversation each time. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if she's in the wrong. The question is about whether her stance on not having kids is wrong in this context. The key points here are communication, mutual understanding, and respect in the relationship. She's been upfront about her stance from the start, which is important. She's made sure her partners don't want kids, so there's a history of compatibility. However, her current boyfriend is older and now making comments about wanting kids, which she's shutting down. The conflict arises here because maybe he's changing his stance or she's being too rigid.\n\nBut the user says they can't afford kids and she's clear about her reasons. She's not stringing people along, which is a good point. However, maybe she's not addressing his feelings or considering if his views on kids have changed. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't the main issue here. The main issue is whether the author is being unreasonable in her position. Since she's communicated her stance early on and the boyfriend is now conflicted, the question is whether her refusal to consider compromise is wrong. But if the author has always been clear and the boyfriend knew that when they started dating, then she's not in the wrong. It's about respecting each other's boundaries. If the boyfriend didn't realize her stance or changed his mind, that's on him. But since the author has been upfront from the start, she's in the right. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
