I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship. She's been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children, and she's been upfront with her boyfriend about this. Her boyfriend, who is older, has been making snippy comments about having kids, and she's shut down those conversations, even telling him to leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author insists she does.\n\nFirst, the key points here are autonomy and communication. The author has consistently communicated her stance on not wanting kids, which is a fundamental aspect of personal choice. Having kids is a major life decision, and it's important that both partners agree. The author isn't pressuring the boyfriend; she's making it clear that she won't budge on this issue. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is bringing up the topic and making comments that might be causing tension. \n\nFinancial stability is another factor. The couple can't even afford their small apartment, so having kids would be a significant burden. The author mentions wanting dogs instead, indicating her preference for other types of commitments. The boyfriend's mother's opinion is mentioned but isn't directly relevant to the core issue of the couple's compatibility regarding children.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The question hinges on whether it's acceptable for someone to not want kids and communicate that clearly. Since the author is upfront and the boyfriend is aware, it's not her fault that he has differing desires. The problem might lie in the boyfriend not respecting her decision, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since she's being honest and clear, she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
