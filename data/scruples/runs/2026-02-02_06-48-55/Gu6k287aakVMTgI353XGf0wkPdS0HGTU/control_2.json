I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The situation is the author is in a 5-year relationship, has always known she doesn't want children, and has made that clear from the start. She's been upfront with her boyfriend and even suggested he leave if that's what he wants. They also can't afford kids, and her boyfriend and his mom think she doesn't love him because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has communicated her stance on kids from the beginning, so there's no deception. She's been consistent in her decision and even set boundaries by telling him he should leave if it's a deal-breaker. Financial constraints are another factor, which are a valid reason. The boyfriend's family is involved, which might add pressure, but the author isn't the one creating that pressure.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If someone doesn't want kids and has communicated that clearly, they're not obligated to change their mind or entertain the idea. The boyfriend's reaction could indicate that he's not aligned with her views, which is a valid reason for not being in the relationship. The fact that he's pushing for kids despite her clear stance might mean he hasn't respected her boundaries. The author's right to make choices about her own body and future is a significant point here. So, from a moral standpoint, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
