I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's clear about not wanting kids from the start and only dates people who don't want kids. However, her boyfriend, who's older, keeps bringing up the topic, and she shuts it down, even telling him to leave if he wants kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is wrong. The key points are whether she's being respectful and honest. She's upfront about her stance, which is a good practice in relationships. But she's in a long-term relationship with someone who might have conflicting desires. The boyfriend's mom is involved, thinking she doesn't love him. The author argues that they can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nIs it wrong to not entertain the idea if it's a fundamental difference? The author isn't being dishonest; she's clear. However, in a long-term relationship, if both partners need to compromise on major issues like having kids, maybe she's not leaving room for discussion. But she's already vetted partners' child desires. Since she's been upfront, maybe she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to accept her stance or realize it's not compatible. The author's firmness could lead to conflict, but she's consistent. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
