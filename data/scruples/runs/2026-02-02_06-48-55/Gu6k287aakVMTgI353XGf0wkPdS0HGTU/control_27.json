I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in her relationship. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship with a boyfriend older than her. She's known since 16 she doesn't want kids, communicates this to partners, and is upfront about it. Her boyfriend is pressuring her about having kids, and she's shutting down the conversation, even telling him to leave if he wants kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman has been clear about her stance on kids since the start of the relationship. She's made sure her partners know before getting serious, which shows she's being honest. The boyfriend, after five years, is still bringing up the topic, and she's responding firmly. The fact that they can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead adds context about her priorities.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a standpoint of personal choice and autonomy, people have the right to choose whether or not to have children. The author isn't being deceptive; she's upfront. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's values. If the boyfriend can't accept her stance, maybe the issue lies with him not respecting her decision. However, if the boyfriend's pressure is causing significant conflict, maybe the problem is his inability to accept her choice. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is wrong. The main factors here are communication and mutual agreement. Since she's been clear from the start, she's not hiding her intentions. The boyfriend might need to decide if he can accept no kids in the relationship. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she's given him a choice. The fact that his mom is involved and thinks she doesn't love him adds another layer, but the author's feelings are genuine. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author has a right to her preferences. The financial aspect is also a valid concern. It's unreasonable to have kids without the means. The author's stance is not selfish; it's practical and honest. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend might be the one needing to adjust his expectations or reconsider the relationship if he can't accept her decision.\n"
