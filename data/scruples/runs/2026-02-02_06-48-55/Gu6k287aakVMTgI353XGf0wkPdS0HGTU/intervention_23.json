I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The author is in her mid-20s, has known since 16 that she doesn't want children, and has been upfront with her boyfriend about this for over five years. He's older, and there's been some pushback from his mom, thinking the author doesn't love him because of her stance. The author argues that kids are expensive, a lot of work, and they can't even afford their apartment, so having kids isn't feasible. She also mentions preferring dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear from the start about her no-kids stance. The boyfriend has stayed with her for over five years, which suggests he's accepted this. However, he's making snippy comments about having kids, and when confronted, the author told him to leave if that's what he wants. His mom is upset, thinking the author doesn't love him, but the author insists she does.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's position is that she's honest and the relationship is incompatible on this issue. The boyfriend's side is that he wants kids, which is a significant life choice, and he's not happy. But since the author has been upfront and the relationship has lasted five years, maybe the boyfriend should have considered this before committing long-term. Also, the financial aspect is a real concern. The author's firm response might be seen as a way to set boundaries, but it could also be perceived as harsh. However, given that she's been consistent and clear, it's possible that the boyfriend should have addressed this earlier. The mom's opinion might not be valid, as she's not part of the relationship dynamics. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for having her own preferences. It's her right to decide not to have children, and she's communicated that. The boyfriend's frustration is understandable, but if he wanted kids, he should have considered that before entering a long-term relationship. The key here is mutual respect and communication. Since the author has been transparent and the relationship has continued despite this, it's more about whether the boyfriend is accepting of her stance. The author isn't in the wrong for standing by her decision, especially when it's been a known factor for years. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
