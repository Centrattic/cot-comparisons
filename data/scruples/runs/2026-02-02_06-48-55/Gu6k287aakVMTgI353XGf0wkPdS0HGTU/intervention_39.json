I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in a long-term relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children, which is her personal choice. She's been upfront with her partners about this, ensuring they know her stance before getting into a relationship. That seems responsible because she's not leading someone on with false expectations.\n\nNow, her boyfriend has been with her for over five years and has started making snippy comments about wanting kids. She shuts down the conversation each time, which might be seen as dismissive, but she's consistent in her stance. She even says if he wants kids, he should leave, which is a strong statement but also shows she's firm in her decision.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author asserts she does. They can't afford kids and both work full-time, which adds to the practical reasons against having children. The author also mentions preferring dogs, which might be a personal preference but isn't the main issue here.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, differing views on having kids can lead to conflict. However, the author has been transparent from the start and is consistent in her position. The boyfriend, on the other hand, hasn't been able to respect her decision despite the long-term commitment. The fact that he's making comments after five years suggests he might not have addressed his feelings earlier or isn't respecting her boundaries now.\n\nIn such cases, it's often about mutual respect. If one partner's core values or desires are not met, it can be a deal-breaker. The author is clear about her stance, and the boyfriend's continued push for kids despite her clear position might indicate that he hasn't been respectful of her needs. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing her ground, especially since she's been honest throughout the relationship.\n"
