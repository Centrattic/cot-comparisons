I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting kids and her boyfriend, who has been with her for over five years, getting snippy comments about the possibility of having children. The author has made it clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids and has only dated people who share that view. However, her boyfriend is older, and they can't afford kids anyway. She's firm in her stance, even telling him he should leave if he wants kids. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author insists she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been consistent about not wanting kids since she was 16. She's been upfront with every partner, ensuring they don't want kids either. The boyfriend has been in the relationship for five years, so it's not like this was a sudden revelation. The financial aspect is also a factor here\u2014they can't afford an apartment, let alone kids. The author wants dogs but not the responsibility of children. The boyfriend is getting pushback when the topic comes up, but the author shuts down the conversation, which might be causing tension. The boyfriend's mother is involved, adding external pressure.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether not wanting children is valid and whether the author is being unreasonable by not entertaining the idea. In many relationships, differing views on having kids can be a deal-breaker. The author has been clear from the start, which is important. However, the boyfriend has been in the relationship for over five years, which might mean he expected this to change or that he's not been fully on board with her stance. The author's firmness in saying he should leave if he wants kids might be seen as harsh, but it's also a realistic stance if she's not going to compromise. \n\nFinancial inability is a significant point. Having kids is expensive, and if they can't afford their current apartment, it's unrealistic to consider having children. The author's decision is also about personal choice and values\u2014preferring dogs over the responsibility of children. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's increasing push for kids could indicate a shift in his preferences or a desire that wasn't fully discussed earlier. If he's been in the relationship for five years and only now is bringing up the issue, maybe he hasn't considered her stance as much as he should. The mother's opinion adds external pressure, which can be problematic in relationships. \n\nThe author is standing by her decision, which is a personal choice. However, the way she handles the conversations (shutting them down, telling him to leave) might be causing conflict. But given her consistent stance and the financial reality, it's hard to see her as wrong. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the boyfriend is unwilling to accept her no-kids stance, then maybe the issue is his expectations. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's been clear, consistent, and realistic about her desires and circumstances. The boyfriend might need to accept that or reconsider the relationship if he can't accept her stance. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
