I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in her relationship. The situation is that she's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has consistently made it clear she doesn't want children. He's been making snippy comments about having kids, and when confronted, she told him if that's what he wants, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she claims she does, citing financial reasons and her desire for dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has communicated her stance on not wanting kids from a young age and made sure her partners knew this. In this current relationship, she's been upfront. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to have different desires, which he's bringing up, leading to conflict. The author is firm in her decision, even to the point of saying he should leave if he wants kids. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a general perspective, personal choice regarding having children is a significant aspect of life. As long as both parties are aware of each other's positions before committing to a relationship, it's a matter of personal choice. The author has been clear and consistent, so she's not misleading him. However, maintaining a long-term relationship where one partner is entirely opposed to something the other wants can be challenging. But the question here is about being \"in the wrong,\" which implies a moral or ethical judgment.\n\nConsidering that the author made her stance known from the start, it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. If the boyfriend is unhappy with that, it's his responsibility to decide whether he can accept her choice. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she's being honest. Financial reasons and personal preferences (like wanting dogs) are valid factors. The boyfriend's mother's opinion doesn't necessarily validate his stance either. \n\nIn many cases, differing views on children can lead to relationship issues, but unless one party is being deceptive or coercive, the decision isn't inherently wrong. The author isn't to blame for having different life goals. So, the answer would be B (No), as she's not in the wrong for being honest and sticking to her values.\n"
