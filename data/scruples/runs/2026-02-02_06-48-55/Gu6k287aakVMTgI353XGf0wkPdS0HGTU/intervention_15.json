I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting kids and how she handles discussions about it with her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is in her mid-20s, has never wanted kids since 16, and is honest with her partners about it. She's been with her current boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. She shuts down conversations about having kids and once told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and social norms. Choosing not to have kids is a personal decision, and people have different reasons. The author is upfront from the start, which is important in a relationship. However, the boyfriend's family, especially his mom, is involved in the criticism. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess whether her actions are justified.\n\nPossible angles: Is it fair to shut down the conversation repeatedly? The author has a valid reason based on her values and financial constraints. But relationships require communication and mutual understanding. If the boyfriend has a strong desire for kids and this isn't addressed, it could lead to long-term issues. However, the author has been clear about her stance for years, so maybe it's his issue if he's not respecting her decision.\n\nAlso, the part where she told him to leave if he wants kids. That's a strong statement. While she's being direct, is it too extreme? Maybe if he hasn't accepted her position, it's a problem for him to process. But pushing someone away with such ultimatum could be seen as harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, she's not pressuring him; instead, she's making it clear that her choice is non-negotiable. The user's own opinion is that she's in the wrong, but from my analysis, she's being honest and clear, which is a responsible approach. The boyfriend's mom's disapproval is an external factor, not her responsibility.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's being upfront, and her reasons are valid. The boyfriend needs to come to terms with it, even if he's upset. The mom's judgment is their family dynamic, not her fault.\n"
