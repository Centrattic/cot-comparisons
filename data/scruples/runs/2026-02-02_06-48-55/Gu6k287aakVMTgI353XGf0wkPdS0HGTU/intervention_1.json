I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting kids and the boyfriend being upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children. She's been upfront with her partners, making sure they don't want kids either. She's been with her current boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's been making comments about having kids, which she shuts down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him because of this, but she insists she does. They also mention financial struggles and wanting dogs instead.\n\nSo, the main points here are her right to make personal reproductive choices, communication in the relationship, and the boyfriend's expectations. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nIn many cultures, having kids is a big deal, and some people might feel pressure to conform. But the author has been consistent in her stance and communicated it clearly. Her reasons\u2014financial issues, lifestyle preferences\u2014are valid. The boyfriend's mom judging her for not wanting kids might reflect societal norms, but that doesn't make the author wrong.\n\nHowever, relationships require mutual understanding. If the boyfriend wants kids and the author is unwilling, there might be a fundamental incompatibility. The author's approach of telling him to leave if that's what he wants could be seen as extreme, but she's standing by her boundaries. The question is whether she's responsible for the boyfriend's unresolved feelings or the mom's judgment.\n\nLegally and ethically, a person has the right to choose whether to have children. The author isn't forcing the boyfriend into anything; she's made her position clear. The boyfriend's unhappiness is his responsibility, not hers. The mom's opinion is also her own, not the author's fault.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's being honest about her desires and has communicated them. The conflict arises from differing values, but she's not obligated to change her stance. The boyfriend might need to accept this or realize it's incompatible. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
