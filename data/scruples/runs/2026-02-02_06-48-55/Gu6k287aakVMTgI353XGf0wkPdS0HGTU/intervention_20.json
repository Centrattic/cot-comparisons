I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in a long-term relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author is in her mid-20s, has always known she doesn't want kids since 16. She's been with her boyfriend for over 5 years, and he's older. He's been making snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts those down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nNow, the user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI should consider the key points here. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting kids since the start of the relationship. She made sure her partners knew before getting serious. In this current relationship, she's upfront and has been consistent. The boyfriend, however, is bringing up the topic, even with snippy comments, and the author is firm in her position. \n\nImportant factors: Open communication is key in relationships, especially about major life decisions like having kids. The author communicated her stance early on, which is responsible. The boyfriend's continued bringing up the issue might indicate that he hasn't accepted her position, which could be a problem. The fact that they've been together for 5+ years suggests they've had time to discuss this, and maybe the boyfriend hasn't respected her boundaries. \n\nFinancial arguments are another point. They can't afford kids, so the author is realistic. Wanting dogs instead shows she's thinking about pets, which is different from kids. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might be adding pressure, but the author's feelings towards the boyfriend are genuine. \n\nI need to weigh if the author is being unreasonable. Since she's been upfront and clear, and the boyfriend hasn't found a way to reconcile his desire for kids with her stance, maybe the issue is on his end. However, if he's bringing up the topic repeatedly and the author is shutting it down, that could be seen as not being open to compromise or discussion. But since the author has a strong stance, it's understandable she's firm. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to have compatible views on major issues. If the author is non-negotiable and the boyfriend can't accept that, maybe the problem is on his side. However, if the author is dismissive and not considering compromise, that could be the issue. But given the author's history of not wanting kids since 16, it's not a sudden change. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong because she communicated her stance early and consistently. The boyfriend might need to accept that or realize they aren't compatible on this issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
