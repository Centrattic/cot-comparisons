I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a woman in her mid-20s who has never wanted kids and has been upfront about it in her relationships. She's been in a 5-year relationship where the boyfriend, who's older, has made snippy comments about having kids. She's shut down those conversations, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author claims she does, citing financial reasons and personal preferences for dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was honest from the start about not wanting kids. That's important because it's a major life decision and compatibility factor in a relationship. She's been consistent in her stance, which is good. The boyfriend has only recently started pushing for kids, maybe because of his age or societal pressures. However, the author's response was to shut down the conversation and tell him to leave if that's what he wants. That might come off as harsh, especially if the boyfriend hasn't been as clear about his desires. \n\nBut wait, the author has been upfront about her stance, so maybe the boyfriend should have considered that when he started the relationship. If he knew from the beginning that she didn't want kids, then bringing it up now could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. On the other hand, if he's been making snippy comments over time, maybe he didn't realize the firmness of her position. However, the author's response of saying \"if kids is what he wants, he should leave\" seems pretty definitive. It's possible that the boyfriend is trying to express his desires but the author is not open to discussion, which could be the crux of the issue.\n\nThe financial aspect is mentioned as a reason. The author says they can't afford kids and their apartment is already a strain. That's a valid concern, and financial readiness is a real issue for many people. The author also mentions she wants dogs instead, which is a personal preference. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, communication is key. If the author has been clear from the start about not wanting kids, then she's not the one being indecisive. The boyfriend might be expecting her to reconsider without acknowledging her stance. But the author's response to tell him to leave if he wants kids could be seen as extreme. While she has the right to her decision, the way she's communicating it might be contributing to the problem. \n\nThe boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, but that's external and not necessarily relevant unless the author's actions have directly affected her. The main conflict is between the author and her boyfriend. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she was honest and consistent. However, the firmness of her response could be seen as harsh. But given the context, she's standing by her decision, which is her right. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with some nuance. Alternatively, if the boyfriend made it clear he wanted kids from the start, then the author's stance is justified. The problem here is that the boyfriend hasn't been clear, but the author's response to shut him down completely might be problematic. \n\nWait, the user says the author told him to leave if he wants kids. That's pretty final. If the boyfriend hasn't made his stance clear, maybe the author overreacted. But if he's been hinting and the author has been firm, then she's standing her ground. It's a bit of a gray area. In terms of right or wrong, the author's actions are within her rights if she's communicated her stance clearly. The boyfriend might need to respect that or realize it's a deal-breaker. So, the author isn't in the wrong because she's been honest, while the boyfriend should have considered her position from the start. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
