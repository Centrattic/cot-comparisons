I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a five-year relationship with a boyfriend older than her. She's been clear since 16 that she doesn't want kids and has made sure her partners were on the same page. Now her boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids, and she's shut down the conversation, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual consent in a relationship. The author has been upfront about not wanting kids, which is important. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have aligned values and be on the same page regarding major life decisions like having children. If one partner is not open to children, the other should respect that unless they can come to a compromise. However, the boyfriend is making snippy comments, which suggests he's not happy with her stance. But the author is firm in her decision, which is her right. However, the user thinks she's in the wrong, possibly because she's dismissing the possibility entirely.\n\nBut wait, the author has stated her position clearly for years. She's been transparent, and the boyfriend might not have considered that her stance is non-negotiable. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she does love him but just can't compromise on this. The financial aspect is also mentioned, which is a valid concern. So, is she in the wrong? If the boyfriend knew from the start she didn't want kids, then he should have considered whether that aligns with his desires. If he's not willing to accept her no, maybe the relationship isn't compatible. However, the author's response of telling him to leave if he wants kids is a strong stance. But given her clarity over the years, she's not wrong for not entertaining the idea. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
