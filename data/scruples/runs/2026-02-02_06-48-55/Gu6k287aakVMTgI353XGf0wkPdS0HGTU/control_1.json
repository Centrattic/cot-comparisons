I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s in a 5-year relationship with her older boyfriend. She's firm about not wanting kids, has communicated this clearly to her boyfriend, and he's okay with it. However, her boyfriend is getting snippy about the possibility of having kids, and she's told him to leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear about her stance on having kids from a young age. She's upfront with her partners, which is good communication. The boyfriend has been in the relationship for over five years, so presumably, he knew her position when they started. If he's now getting upset about it, maybe he didn't take her stance seriously or is having a change of heart. The author's response of telling him to leave if he wants kids is a clear boundary.\n\nNext, financial aspects are mentioned. They can't afford kids and have a small apartment. The author wants dogs instead. That suggests she's thought through her priorities. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might be influencing him, but the mother's opinion shouldn't dictate the couple's decisions if they're adults in their own relationship.\n\nPossible angles: Is it wrong to not have kids? No, it's a personal choice. The author communicated her stance, so she's not stringing people along. The boyfriend might need to accept her position or realize it's not compatible. However, if he's been in the relationship for five years and is only now bringing up the issue, maybe he hasn't respected her wishes consistently. The author's firm stance is a right she has.\n\nOn the other hand, could there be a lack of compromise? But the author isn't opposed to all children, just in this situation. She's making a choice based on her values and reality. The boyfriend's comments could be trying to push her, but she's standing her ground. The mother's interference adds another layer, but the couple's decisions should be their own.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She's communicated her decision, made conscious choices, and is standing by them. The boyfriend's dissatisfaction is his issue to resolve, possibly by reevaluating his commitment to the relationship. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
