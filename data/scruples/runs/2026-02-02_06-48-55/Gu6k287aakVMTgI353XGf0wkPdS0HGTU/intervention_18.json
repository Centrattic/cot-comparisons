I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He keeps bringing up the topic of having kids, and she shuts it down, even telling him he should leave if that's what he wants. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting kids from a young age. She's making sure her partners know this before getting into relationships, which is responsible. However, with her current boyfriend, who she's been with for over five years, there's ongoing tension about this issue. The boyfriend is pushing for kids, and she's refusing. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not entertaining the idea.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to have compatible long-term goals. If one partner is firmly against something that the other wants, it's a significant issue. The author has communicated her stance clearly and even warned him that if kids are important to him, he should leave. That might come off as harsh, but it's a direct way of setting boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's mother's opinion is mentioned, which could add pressure. But the mother's view is just an external opinion and not the main issue here. The main issue is between the couple. The author mentions that they can't afford kids and that she wants dogs. Financial stability is a valid concern, and wanting pets instead of kids shows her priorities are different.\n\nIs it wrong for her to not consider having kids? Well, it's a personal choice. People have different values. However, in a long-term relationship, differing views on children can lead to conflict. The author's firm stance might be causing the boyfriend to feel neglected or unheard. But since she's been consistent and upfront, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. She's being honest, which is important in a relationship.\n\nBut the user thinks she's in the wrong. Maybe because she's dismissive of his wants? However, if he truly needs kids and she can't compromise, it's a deal-breaker. The problem isn't her not entertaining the idea but whether the relationship can continue without that compromise. It's more about whether both partners are willing to accept each other's positions. The author isn't at fault for having her own desires; the onus is on the boyfriend to decide if he can accept that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). She's being honest and clear about her stance, which is necessary in a relationship. The conflict arises from differing priorities, but she's not wrong for holding her ground.\n"
