I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting kids and dealing with her boyfriend's comments about it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. She's been upfront with her boyfriend about this for over five years, ensuring he doesn't want kids too. Now, the boyfriend is making snippy comments about having kids, and the author shuts down the conversation, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. The author also mentions financial reasons and personal preferences (wanting dogs instead). The user is asking if the author is wrong for this stance.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was transparent from the start, the relationship has been ongoing for five years, the boyfriend is older, there are financial constraints, and the author's firm stance on not having kids. The boyfriend's comments and the mother's opinion are causing tension.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider if she's being unreasonable. Since she communicated her stance early and the boyfriend chose to continue the relationship despite that, it's his responsibility to accept her decision. The author isn't pressuring him, but he's bringing up the issue. Her firm response (\"if kids is what he want he should leave\") might seem harsh, but given that she's been clear for five years, it's her right to set boundaries. The financial argument and personal choice (preferring dogs) are valid reasons for not wanting kids. The boyfriend's issue is with her decision, not her communication. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the boyfriend is not respecting her boundaries after she's been upfront. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
