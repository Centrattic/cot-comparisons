I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids in their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author has been clear about not wanting children since she was 16. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has communicated her stance each time the topic comes up. She even told him directly that if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend is older, and his mom is involved, thinking the author doesn't love him. But the author does love him, mentions they can't afford kids, and prefers dogs instead.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author has been consistent and upfront about her feelings. She's made sure to screen potential partners for their views on kids. In the current relationship, she's not hiding her stance, even if it's causing tension. The boyfriend's mom is involved, but the author's reasons are practical (financial, lifestyle). \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect and communication. The author isn't forcing her views on him; she's making a choice based on her values and circumstances. The boyfriend might feel pressure if he wants kids, but the author has the right to her own reproductive choices. Societal norms might push for having kids, but personal choice and honesty are important in a relationship. The author isn't in the wrong because she's being transparent and sticking to her values. So the answer should be B.\n"
