I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the woman in the scenario is wrong for not wanting to have kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has made her stance clear from the start. She doesn't want kids because of the costs, the work involved, and she prefers dogs. She's been upfront with her boyfriend, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does, and they can't afford kids anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if not wanting kids is inherently wrong. Child-free choices are personal and valid. The woman has been honest from the start, which is important in relationships. Her reasons are practical\u2014financial and lifestyle. She's also respecting her own desires and not trying to convince him otherwise. The boyfriend's mom's opinion isn't something she should be responsible for. The key points here are her honesty, the duration of the relationship, and mutual respect for each other's choices. If the boyfriend can't accept her stance after five years, maybe the relationship has deeper issues. So, the woman isn't in the wrong here. She's made her boundaries clear and isn't shying away from them. The answer should be B.\n"
