I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who has always known they don't want kids and has been upfront with their partners, especially their boyfriend of over five years. The boyfriend is older, and he's making comments about having kids. The author shuts down the conversation and even said if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author maintains they do, just can't have kids due to financial reasons and personal desires.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear about not wanting kids from the start, which is important in a relationship. Open communication about such a significant life decision is crucial. The boyfriend, however, is bringing up the topic repeatedly and making comments, which might indicate he hasn't accepted her stance. The author's response is firm, which some might see as harsh, but others might view as necessary given the long-term commitment of a relationship.\n\nFinancial factors play a role too. The couple can't even afford a small apartment, making having kids seem impractical. The author also mentions wanting dogs instead, which shows a preference for different types of responsibilities. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend knew from the beginning that she didn't want kids, then the author isn't hiding her stance. However, the boyfriend's continued push for kids after five years might indicate a fundamental incompatibility. The author's decision to shut down the conversation and even suggest leaving if he wants kids is a matter of personal choice and boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual respect and compatibility. If both partners have discussed and agreed on having no kids, then the author isn't wrong. But since the boyfriend is pushing for it, perhaps he hasn't accepted reality. The author's firmness could be seen as self-respecting her own needs. However, the comment about him leaving might be a strong reaction, but it's within her right to set such a boundary if it's a deal-breaker.\n\nI think the key here is that the author was transparent from the start. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might be irrelevant if both partners have communicated their needs. The author isn't in the wrong because she's been clear and consistent. The boyfriend should have accepted her position when they started dating. So the answer is B.\n"
