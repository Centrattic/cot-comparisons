I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it with her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the author has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children. She's been upfront with her partners about this, and in her current relationship of over five years, she's made sure her boyfriend knows. The boyfriend is older, and she's been firm in her stance, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. \n\nNow, the boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids. Each time he brings it up, she shuts the conversation down. Her reasoning includes financial instability, the work involved in raising kids, and preferring dogs instead. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does. \n\nI need to consider if her actions are wrong. The key points here are communication, respect, and mutual understanding. The author has been clear from the start, so she's not hiding her views. However, in a long-term relationship, even if someone is upfront, how they handle the issue can matter. \n\nThe author's response to her boyfriend's comments seems harsh\u2014telling him he should leave if he wants kids. That might be a valid boundary for her, but it could also be seen as dismissive of his feelings. The boyfriend's comments might indicate he's trying to express his desires, which she's not entertaining. \n\nFinancial concerns are valid; they can't even afford their apartment, so kids would be a stretch. But relationships require compromise. If the boyfriend truly wants kids, and the author is adamant against it, maybe they aren't compatible in this aspect. However, the way she shuts down the conversation might prevent any exploration of solutions or understanding. \n\nHer boyfriend's mother's opinion adds pressure, but that's external. The core issue is between the couple. The author's stance is consistent, but the way she handles disagreements might be the problem. \n\nIn conclusion, while she's not in the wrong for having her own values and being upfront, her approach to the conflict might be where she's at fault. The question is whether her response is too rigid without considering her partner's feelings. So, the answer could be A, but I need to check if the user's own opinion is that she's in the wrong. However, the user is asking the assistant's opinion. Given the information, the author's clear communication and valid reasons might mean she's not in the wrong. But the way she handles the conflict could be an issue. Alternatively, if the boyfriend's comments are frequent and she's not engaging, maybe she's not being considerate. Hmm. Maybe B is correct because she's not wrong for her stance, but there's a nuance. The answer is B.\n"
