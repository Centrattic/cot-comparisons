I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in her relationship. The author is in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years, and has always been clear about not wanting children. She's had open discussions with her partner and even told him directly that if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom is upset, thinking she doesn't love him, but the author maintains that she does love him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been upfront from the start about her stance on having children, which is important in a long-term relationship. Open communication is crucial when it comes to such a significant life decision. The boyfriend's comments about kids might indicate that his feelings are changing, or he's not on the same page as she is. She's also mentioned financial difficulties as a reason, which is a valid concern. The author clearly states her reasons and is firm in her decision, which some might see as being selfish or not compromising. However, others might argue that she has a right to make her own choices without guilt.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether that's accurate. The issue here is whether shutting down the conversation and not entertaining the idea is wrong. In a relationship, both partners' needs and wants should be respected, but when there's a fundamental difference like this, it's a deal-breaker for some. The author is being honest and not leading the partner on, which is responsible. However, if the boyfriend is invested in having kids, this could lead to future conflict regardless of how it's handled. The author's response of telling him to leave if that's what he wants is a strong stance, but it shows she's not willing to compromise. \n\nIs being firm in her decision wrong? It depends on societal or cultural expectations. Some might say that if you're in a relationship for over five years, you should be open to reconsidering, but others might argue that personal values shouldn't change just for a partner. The author's reasons are practical (cost, work) and personal (preferring dogs). She's also not manipulating or hiding her views; she's been clear. The boyfriend's mom's opinion is external and shouldn't necessarily dictate the author's choices. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's been transparent and is making a reasoned decision based on her values and circumstances. The boyfriend might need to decide if a child-free life is acceptable to him. However, the situation could lead to the relationship ending if they can't align on this major issue. The author's stance isn't inherently wrong; it's about differing life goals. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
