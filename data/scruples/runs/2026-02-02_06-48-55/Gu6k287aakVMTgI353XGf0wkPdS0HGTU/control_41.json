I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's been making snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversation. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her stance on not wanting kids, her communication with her boyfriend, and the financial aspect. She's been clear from the start about not wanting kids, which is important. Choosing not to have children is a personal decision and there's no moral obligation, so that's a point in her favor. However, the boyfriend has been pushing for kids, which might indicate a fundamental difference in their life goals. \n\nThe user is asking if she's wrong for not entertaining the idea. The question is whether it's her fault for not compromising. But if the boyfriend knew from the start that she didn't want kids and is now pressuring her, maybe the issue is on his side. However, she's been in the relationship for over five years, and maybe he expected her stance to change, which is unrealistic. \n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't afford an apartment, so having kids would be even more stressful. She's also mentioned wanting dogs, which is a preference but not as significant as the kids issue. \n\nThe user might be considering if she's being selfish or if she's being honest. Since she's been upfront and the relationship is long-term, it's possible that the boyfriend should have considered her stance before getting too serious. But maybe he thought they could find a solution. However, if the conversation keeps coming up and she's firm, maybe the problem is his insistence. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because she's been clear, and the decision to not have kids is personal. The boyfriend may need to accept that or leave, which is a tough call but not her fault.\n"
