I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about choosing not to have kids despite a partner wanting them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author is in her mid-20s, has always known she doesn't want kids, and has been upfront with her boyfriend about it. They've been together over five years, and he's older. She shuts down conversations about kids and told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author says she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are her honesty from the start, the duration of the relationship, financial constraints, and the partner's differing views. \n\nHonesty is crucial in relationships, especially regarding such a significant decision as having children. The author made it clear from the beginning, so she's not hiding her stance. However, the boyfriend's desire for kids hasn't been addressed adequately. Ending the relationship if he wants kids is a firm stance, but maybe she should have discussed compromises or explored if there's a middle ground. Still, she's not forcing him to stay or to change his views; she's stating her position clearly.\n\nFinancial aspects are real. They can't even afford their apartment, so having kids would be a stretch. The author also mentions her preference for dogs, which are a different kind of responsibility. That shows she's aware of her limitations and priorities.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother's opinion isn't her fault. The main issue is between her and her boyfriend. If he's unhappy with her decision, maybe he's not the right partner. The fact that she's been consistent for five years suggests she's not being impulsive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't being dishonest or manipulative. She's been clear and upfront. The decision not to have kids is personal and valid. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
