I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman in her mid-20s who has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's firm about not wanting kids and has made that clear from the start, but her boyfriend keeps bringing it up, leading to tension. The boyfriend's mom even thinks the author doesn't love him, which she does. Now, the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting children since she was 16. In her past relationships, she made sure to only date people who shared her view. With her current partner, she's been in a long-term relationship but he's pushing for kids, which she refuses to entertain. She's also mentioned financial reasons and her own priorities like wanting dogs instead of kids.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is at fault. To determine this, I should look at relationship dynamics, communication, and mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's values and boundaries. The author has been upfront about her position, which is important. However, her response to her boyfriend's desires is quite firm\u2014saying he should leave if he wants kids. That might be seen as harsh, but if she's clear from the start, it's her right to set those boundaries.\n\nThe boyfriend's mother's opinion might not be relevant, but it's a point of tension. The financial aspect is a valid concern; having kids is expensive. The author wants to be honest and not lead someone on. She's prioritizing her own life goals over societal expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is expressing his desire for children, which is a significant life decision. If the author is unwilling to compromise, that's a deal-breaker for him. But if he's aware of her stance and continues to push, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual agreement on major issues like having children. If the author made her stance clear and the boyfriend is still in the relationship despite that, maybe the issue lies with him for not accepting her position. However, if the author is dismissive and unwilling to consider any alternatives or discuss it constructively, that could be a problem. But given her history of being upfront, she's probably not at fault here.\n\nFinancial stability is also a factor. The author mentions they can't even afford a small apartment, which makes having kids unrealistic. That's a practical concern. The fact that she wants dogs instead shows she's willing to commit to some responsibilities but not to children. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. She's being honest about her preferences, and if the relationship is causing conflict because of differing desires on such a significant matter, it's a matter of compatibility rather than right or wrong. The boyfriend might need to accept her stance or realize it's not a fit. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she's just being truthful about her own wants.\n"
