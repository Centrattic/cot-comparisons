I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is in her mid-20s, has always known she doesn't want kids and communicates this to her partners. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's been bringing up kids. She shuts down the conversation each time, even telling him if he wants kids he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and the author wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and whether her actions are reasonable. The author is upfront about her stance on kids from the start, which is important in a long-term relationship. She's been clear and consistent, which is good. However, the boyfriend is making snippy comments about having kids, which might indicate he's not respecting her boundaries. The author's response, while firm, might be seen as harsh, especially telling him to leave if he wants kids. That could be seen as cutting off negotiation or compromise. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone has an absolute stance, it's reasonable to expect their partner to respect that. The boyfriend might be testing the boundaries or not accepting her position. The author's priority is clear, and she's not in the wrong for standing by her decision. The boyfriend's mother's opinion isn't relevant here; the main issue is between the couple. Financial issues are also a valid reason not to have kids. The author's decision to prioritize her own desires (wanting dogs) is a personal choice and not inherently wrong. \n\nBut maybe the way she shuts down the conversation could be improved. Instead of telling him to leave, perhaps discussing why he wants kids and finding a middle ground. However, given that she's been clear from the start and the relationship has lasted five years, it's possible the boyfriend hasn't respected her boundaries. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. The key is mutual respect and communication. If the boyfriend is repeatedly bringing it up despite her clear stance, he's the one not respecting her. So the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
