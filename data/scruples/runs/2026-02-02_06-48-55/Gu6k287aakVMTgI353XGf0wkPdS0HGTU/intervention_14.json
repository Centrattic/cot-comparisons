I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether not wanting to have kids makes the author responsible for any wrongdoing in their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a woman in her mid-20s, has been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear since she was 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's been upfront with her partners about this. Her boyfriend is older, and he's been making snippy comments about having kids. When the topic comes up, she shuts the conversation down. She even told him that if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids and she prefers dogs.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious to know others' opinions. The answer should be A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nNow, to evaluate if she's in the wrong. The key points here are about personal choice, communication, and relationship dynamics. Having children is a significant decision that affects both partners. Not wanting to have kids is a personal choice, and many people choose not to have children. However, in a relationship, both partners' desires and values need to align. \n\nThe author has been clear about her stance on kids since the beginning. She's been upfront with her partners, which is good communication. However, her response to her boyfriend's comments is harsh\u2014telling him to leave if he wants kids. This could be seen as dismissive of his feelings or not engaging in a meaningful discussion. While her stance is valid, the way she handles it might be problematic. \n\nThe boyfriend's mother's opinion is also mentioned, which might indicate that there's pressure from the family side. But the user's main focus is on the author's actions. If the boyfriend hasn't communicated his desire for kids clearly or hasn't addressed the financial concerns, that's on him. But the author's response of \"leave if you want kids\" could be seen as not leaving room for compromise or discussion. \n\nHowever, the author has made her position clear from the start. It's possible that the boyfriend didn't realize her stance was non-negotiable. In that case, maybe the boyfriend should have discussed this more thoroughly before getting into a long-term relationship. The author's decision to not even entertain the idea might be seen as right if both parties were aware, but the way she handles the conflict could be a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong, it's about whether her actions (telling him to leave) are unjust. Since she's communicated her stance and made it clear that it's not negotiable, she's not obligated to consider having kids. However, the abruptness of her response might be seen as harsh. But considering the long-term commitment and that she's been upfront, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The problem might lie in the boyfriend's expectations and not addressing the issue in a way that respects both partners' views.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for being clear about her preferences and making decisions based on her values, even if the communication style could be improved. The boyfriend's expectations might not have aligned with hers, but the author isn't at fault for standing by her choice.\n"
