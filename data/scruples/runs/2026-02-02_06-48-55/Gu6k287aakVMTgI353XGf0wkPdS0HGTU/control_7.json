I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting kids and her boyfriend, who's been with her over five years, making comments about having children. She's shut down conversations about it and told him to leave if that's what he wants. Her mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she insists she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been clear about her stance on kids since she was 16. She's been upfront with partners about not wanting kids to avoid leading them on. That shows she's been consistent and honest. Now, in this long-term relationship, the boyfriend is bringing up the topic, and she's pushing back. She's even told him directly that if he wants kids, he should leave. That's a strong statement but maybe necessary if the issue is deal-breaking for her.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom is involved, thinking the author doesn't love him. But the author maintains she does. The financial aspect is also a factor\u2014can't afford kids. They both work full-time and have a small apartment. She wants dogs instead of a lifetime responsibility, which is a personal preference.\n\nNow, who's in the wrong? The user is asking if the author is wrong for not entertaining having kids. The question is about her right to make that choice. In relationships, personal choices like having kids are major decisions. If both partners can't agree, it's a valid reason to part ways. The author has been clear since the start, so it's not like she's been leading him on. The boyfriend might feel frustrated, but she's not obligated to change her stance for him. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend thought they could find a compromise or that her stance would change over time. But she's been firm. It's possible they're at an impasse. The author isn't in the wrong for sticking to her decision, especially since she's communicated it early. Ending the relationship if the core values don't align is reasonable. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
