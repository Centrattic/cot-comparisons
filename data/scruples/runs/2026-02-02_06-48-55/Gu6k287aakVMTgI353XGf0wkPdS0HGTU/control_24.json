I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it. The situation is that she's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has consistently made it clear she doesn't want kids. She's had snippy comments from him, and even told him to leave if he wants kids. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. She's been upfront about her stance on kids from the start. She made sure they were on the same page when they started dating. Now, he's bringing it up again, and she's firm. The question is about whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a right/wrong perspective, it's about respect and communication. She's communicated her position clearly, which is important in a relationship. However, if he hasn't addressed his feelings about kids despite her clear stance, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. But the author is defending her choice, not forcing him to change. She's not stringing him along, as she's been clear. Financial reasons are valid, and her choice to not have kids is her right. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not accepting her decision, but the author isn't at fault for sticking to her values. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
