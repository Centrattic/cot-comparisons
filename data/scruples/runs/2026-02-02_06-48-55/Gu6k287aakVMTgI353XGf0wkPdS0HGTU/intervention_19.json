I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids, and she's made sure previous partners felt the same. Now, her boyfriend, who's older, is making comments about having kids, and she's been shutting those conversations down. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she argues that they can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was clear about her stance on kids early on. She's been in a long-term relationship and made sure compatibility on having kids was there before. That's important because it's a major life decision. However, the boyfriend is now bringing up the issue after five years, even though he knew her position from the start. That might be a red flag for the author. If he knew she didn't want kids, why is he still bringing it up after so long? Maybe he's not respecting her boundaries or maybe he's changed his own stance. But the author's consistent position is that she doesn't want kids, and she's communicated that clearly. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that over time his feelings have changed or that he wants to have kids and is trying to see if there's any compromise. But the author is firm, which is understandable given her values. The boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, suggesting that maybe there's pressure from his side of the family, but that's not the author's problem. \n\nFinancial aspects are a big part of the author's reasoning. They can't even afford their apartment, so having kids is impractical. She also mentions wanting dogs, which are different in terms of responsibility. So her reasons are practical and personal. \n\nIs she wrong for not entertaining the idea? Well, if two people are not aligned on such a big issue, it's a deal-breaker. The author has been clear, and the boyfriend is either not respecting that or hasn't realized it's a non-negotiable. However, after five years, maybe the boyfriend is testing if there's any flexibility. But the author's stance seems firm. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to have compatible long-term goals. If having kids is a deal-breaker for one person, and the other person can't accept that, then it's a problem. However, in this case, the author has been upfront, so she's not stringing him along. The boyfriend might need to consider if he can accept her no-children stance. If he can't, then the responsibility is on him to decide if he can stay in the relationship. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's been honest and consistent. The boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries or not being honest about his own needs. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
