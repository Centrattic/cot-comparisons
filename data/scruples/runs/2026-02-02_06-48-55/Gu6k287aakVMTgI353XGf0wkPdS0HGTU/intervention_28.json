I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's making comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation and even told him to leave if that's what he wants. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but the author says she does, just can't have kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting kids since she was 16. She's been upfront with her partners, which is good. Now, with a long-term boyfriend, he's bringing up the topic, and she's firm in her position. The question is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea.\n\nFrom one angle, being honest about life goals and not wanting kids is valid. It's her right to not want children, and she's communicated that clearly. However, the boyfriend has been in the relationship for over five years, so maybe the author should have discussed this more openly with him, rather than just shutting down the conversation. The boyfriend might feel his desires aren't being considered, leading to tension. Also, the mother's opinion might not matter as much, but it's causing strain.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons: financial instability, not wanting the responsibility of kids, and wanting a different life (like having dogs). She's not being selfish; she's honest about her boundaries. The boyfriend might need to accept that if having kids is non-negotiable for him, then maybe the relationship isn't a good fit. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe because she shut down the conversation without trying to find a compromise or understand his perspective. However, if she's adamant about not having kids, there might be no middle ground. It's important in relationships to discuss such issues early, but since they've been together for five years, the boyfriend should have also communicated his feelings about wanting kids earlier. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for being clear about her stance. It's her choice, and she's communicated her position. The problem might lie in the boyfriend not being open to the possibility of a child-free life. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
