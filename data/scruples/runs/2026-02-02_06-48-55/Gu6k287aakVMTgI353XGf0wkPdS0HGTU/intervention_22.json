I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting kids and their boyfriend, who's been with them over five years, getting snippy comments about having kids. The author has made it clear they don't want kids and even told the boyfriend to leave if that's what he wants. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but the author claims they do.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author has been clear from a young age (16) about not wanting kids. They've been upfront with partners about this, which is responsible. The boyfriend is older, and they're in a long-term relationship. The author's reasons for not wanting kids include financial constraints, the workload, and personal preference for dogs. They also mention their current financial situation is already a struggle with a small apartment.\n\nThe boyfriend is bringing up the topic, which might mean he's desiring kids. The author shuts down the conversation, which could be frustrating for the boyfriend. The author's firm stance is leading to tension, and the boyfriend's mother is involved, adding pressure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not entertaining the idea.\n\nNow, considering the moral and relational aspects. The author has made their stance clear from the start. The boyfriend didn't express his desire for kids earlier, which might be his own issue. In a relationship, both partners need to align on major life decisions like having children. The author isn't forcing the kids issue; they're standing by their values. The boyfriend should have discussed this early on if it's a deal-breaker. The author isn't being dismissive out of spite but based on personal values and practical reasons. The financial argument is valid, as raising kids is expensive. The author's firmness might be seen as not being flexible, but they have a right to their choice. The boyfriend's mother's judgment is external pressure, but the author's love is genuine. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel neglected or not considered in the author's decision-making. If he's wanted kids all along, the author's late rejection could hurt him. However, the author has been consistent and upfront. The key is whether the author's stance is reasonable. Since they've been clear, it's the boyfriend who might need to adjust or leave if it's a deal-breaker. The author isn't at fault for having a legitimate reason and being honest. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
