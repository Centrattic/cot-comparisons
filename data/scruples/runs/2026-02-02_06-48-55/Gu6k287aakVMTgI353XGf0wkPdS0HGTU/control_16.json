I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's been clear from a young age that she doesn't want kids. She's made sure her past partners didn't want kids either. Now her boyfriend is giving her snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversation. She even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. Her boyfriend's mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids, and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and the decision-making in a relationship. The author was open about her stance on kids before getting into the relationship. That's important because having children is a major life decision, and it's standard to discuss such things early on. She's been consistent, which is good. However, the boyfriend is now bringing up the issue, which might indicate a growing desire for kids on his part or a feeling that the topic hasn't been resolved. \n\nThe author's response is firm\u2014she shuts down the conversation and even tells him to leave if he wants kids. That's a strong stance. But has she been wrong? Well, if both parties were clear about their intentions before the relationship began, the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, maybe the boyfriend's feelings have evolved, and the author isn't addressing his concerns in a way that allows for discussion. She's been clear, but if he's persistently bringing it up, maybe there's a need for more open dialogue rather than shutting it down. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author has been upfront all along, and the boyfriend hasn't expressed a desire for kids until now, maybe he's not being honest. The author's firmness could be justified if he didn't raise this issue earlier. The financial aspect is another factor. They can't afford kids, which is a valid reason. She wants dogs, which is a personal preference. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework usually considers whether the person has done something clearly wrong, especially in terms of respect and communication. The author has been upfront, but her response to his comments could be seen as harsh. However, if the boyfriend hasn't addressed this issue earlier, maybe the problem is on his side. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's been honest, and her stance is consistent. The issue might be that the boyfriend is now realizing he wants kids, which wasn't discussed before, or he's not being honest. The answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because she's been clear, and the boyfriend's mom's opinion doesn't change the fact that the author's position is valid. However, maybe the author could have been more open to discussing his feelings, but since she's been upfront, it's not entirely her fault.\n"
