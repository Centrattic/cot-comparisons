I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author is a woman in her mid-20s who's been with her boyfriend for over five years. She's known since she was 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's made this clear in past relationships, ensuring her partners are on the same page. Now, her current boyfriend, who's older, has been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts down these conversations and once told him if he wants kids, he should leave. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him, but she insists she does. They can't afford kids financially, and she prefers dogs instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. So, first, the author has been upfront about her stance on kids from the start. That's important because it's clear she's not leading someone on. The boyfriend is older, so maybe he has different expectations, but if he hasn't addressed this issue directly, that's a problem. The author is firm in her decision, and she's made it clear to the boyfriend and his mom. The financial aspect is a valid concern too, and her preference for dogs over kids is personal.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is being honest about her views, which is good. However, maybe she's being dismissive by shutting down conversations and telling him to leave. But she's consistent in her views and has made them clear. The boyfriend's mom's opinion might not be relevant, but if the boyfriend hasn't communicated his own stance clearly to her, that's an issue. The author isn't the one changing her mind here; she's been consistent. She's also considering the practical aspects, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's about whether she's respecting his feelings. But the problem might be that the boyfriend hasn't addressed his own needs. If he hasn't communicated that he wants kids, or if he's only making snippy comments instead of a real conversation, then maybe he's the one not handling it properly. The author is standing by her decision, which isn't inherently wrong. She's not manipulating him; she's being upfront. Therefore, the answer might be B, that she's not in the wrong.\n"
