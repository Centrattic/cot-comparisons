I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has always known she doesn't want kids, has been upfront with her boyfriend for over five years about it, and has even told him to leave if he wants kids. The boyfriend and his mom think she doesn't love him, but she argues they can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is wrong. The author is clear about her stance from a young age, communicated it early in relationships, and is consistent with her current partner. She's not stringing people along, which is a common concern in AITA scenarios. The boyfriend's mom's opinion is mentioned, but the main issue is between the couple.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The author has been upfront about her no-children stance, which is important. The boyfriend might be unhappy, but it's his choice to stay despite that. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she's made her position clear. Financial concerns and personal preferences (wanting dogs) are valid reasons. \n\nHowever, some might argue that being \"snippy\" or shutting down conversations isn't respectful. But given the long-term commitment, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest and not changing her stance for the relationship. The boyfriend's mom's judgment isn't the author's responsibility. \n\nSo, the consensus would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
