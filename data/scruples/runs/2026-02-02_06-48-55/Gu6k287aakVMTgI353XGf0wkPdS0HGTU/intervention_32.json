I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids and has been upfront with her boyfriend, who's older, about this. They've been together over five years, and he's been making snippy comments about having kids. She shuts it down each time and even told him to leave if that's what he wants. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she argues they can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but others might disagree. Let me break it down. The author has been clear from the start she doesn't want kids, which is important. She's been honest with her boyfriend, so he knew this before committing to the relationship. However, after five years, he's still bringing it up, which could indicate a deal-breaker for him. The question is whether she's wrong for not entertaining the idea.\n\nFactors to consider: Honesty and communication. She was upfront, so she's not lying. He might not have considered this as a non-negotiable. The fact that his mom is involved suggests family pressure, but that's not the author's responsibility. Financial reasons are valid; having kids is expensive, and they can't even afford their apartment. She values dogs over children, which is a personal choice. However, five years is a long time. If he's been pushing for kids each time it comes up and she's shutting it down, maybe there's a communication issue on both sides. The problem is whether her stance is wrong. Since she's consistent and honest, and the decision not to have kids is personal, it's more about compatibility. She's not wrong for having her own values. The boyfriend might need to accept this or realize it's a deal-breaker. So the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
