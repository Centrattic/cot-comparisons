I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her mid-20s who has always known she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. She's been clear about not wanting kids and shuts down conversations about it. He's made some snippy comments, and she even told him if he wants kids, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she says she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and the impact on the relationship. The author has been upfront from the start about her stance on kids, which is important. She's been with her boyfriend for a long time, so it's possible he's had years to adjust to that fact. However, the boyfriend is bringing up the topic and getting snippy, which might indicate he's not happy with the arrangement. The author's response of telling him to leave if he wants kids is strong, but it's her right to set boundaries if her stance is non-negotiable.\n\nFinancial aspects are mentioned as a reason, but the author's main point is her personal choice, not just finances. She also mentions wanting dogs, which is a personal preference. The boyfriend's mother's opinion is brought up, but that's more about how others perceive the relationship, not the actual issue between the couple.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author has been transparent. The boyfriend might be struggling with his own desires versus the relationship. The author isn't forcing him to stay; she's making her position clear. However, the way she shuts down conversations and the ultimatum could be seen as dismissive. But given that this is a personal choice and she's been consistent, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. The boyfriend's persistence in bringing it up might be the issue here, not the author's stance.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's communicated her stance clearly and is sticking to her decision, which is a valid personal choice.\n"
