I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The person, a woman in her mid-20s, has been clear from a young age that she doesn't want children. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has made sure he shares her stance. But he's been making snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts down the conversation. She even told him to leave if he wants kids. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she argues they can't afford kids and prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has been upfront about her stance from the start. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, which is a significant amount of time. She's communicated her feelings clearly, even to the point of saying if he wants kids, he should leave. That seems pretty definitive. Financial reasons and lifestyle choices are valid concerns. She wants dogs instead of children, which is a personal choice. \n\nThe boyfriend's snippy comments might indicate some unresolved feelings or pressure from his side, perhaps influenced by his mom. However, the author has made her position clear multiple times. The key here is whether she's in the wrong for not entertaining the idea of having kids. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. If the author has been clear and the boyfriend hasn't respected her boundaries, then he might be at fault. But the question is about the author's fault. Since she's been upfront, given the long-term relationship, and the financial and personal reasons are valid, it's her right to make that choice. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to reconsider if he can accept her stance or not, but it's the author's decision to make.\n"
