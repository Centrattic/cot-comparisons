I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a woman in her mid-20s who has known since 16 that she doesn't want kids. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years and has consistently made it clear that she doesn't want children. However, he keeps bringing up the topic, leading to tension. The author has even said if he wants kids, he should leave.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author has been upfront about her stance on having kids from the start of the relationship. That's important because transparency is crucial in long-term relationships, especially regarding such a significant life decision. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has been bringing up the issue repeatedly, which the author finds frustrating. The boyfriend's mother is involved, which might add pressure, but the author's perspective is that her love isn't in question despite her stance on kids.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author isn't stringing him along; she's clear about her position. If the boyfriend wanted kids, he should have considered that before entering a long-term relationship. The financial aspect is also mentioned\u2014they can't even afford their apartment, so having kids would be impractical. The author's preference for dogs instead of children is a personal choice and doesn't inherently make her wrong.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's feelings and desires are valid too. Long-term relationships require compromise, and if having kids is a deal-breaker for him, maybe the relationship isn't sustainable. But the author hasn't been the one to compromise here; she's set a boundary. The question is whether her stance is unreasonable. Personal choices about having children are personal, and as long as both parties are aware and in agreement, it's not the other's fault. Since she's communicated clearly, the boyfriend's dissatisfaction is his decision to make, not hers.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's been honest and consistent, and her reasons are practical and personal. The boyfriend needs to decide if he can accept her choice. The answer should be B.\n"
