I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The situation is that the author is a woman in her mid-20s who has never wanted kids since she was 16. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's older. He's given her snippy comments about having kids, and she shuts the conversation down. She even told him if that's what he wants, he should leave. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she does. They can't afford kids and she wants dogs instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been clear about her stance on not wanting kids from the start. She made sure her partners knew this before dating them. That's good because it's important to be upfront about such significant life decisions. Now, with her current boyfriend, she's been in a long-term relationship. The boyfriend is making comments about wanting kids, which suggests he might want them eventually. The author is firm in her position and even told him to leave if that's what he wants. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. The author communicated her stance early on. The boyfriend, however, hasn't been able to accept that or come to a mutual understanding. The fact that his mom is involved and thinks the author doesn't love him adds another layer, but that's his mother's perspective, not the author's fault. \n\nFinancial stability is another factor. They can't afford kids, and the author mentions they can't even afford their small apartment. That's a legitimate concern. Wanting dogs instead also shows her preference for pets but not the lifelong responsibility of children.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. She's been consistent in her position, and it's her right to make that choice. However, in a long-term relationship, differing views on having children can be a deal-breaker. The boyfriend might feel that he can't reconcile this difference, which could lead to a breakup. But is the author at fault for standing by her decision? Probably not. She's being honest and clear. The boyfriend's reaction and the pressure from his mother might indicate that he hasn't fully accepted her stance, which is his issue to work through. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. She's being truthful and upfront, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's frustration is his responsibility, not hers. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
