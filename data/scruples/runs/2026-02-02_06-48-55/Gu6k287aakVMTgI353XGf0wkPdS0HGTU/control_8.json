I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting kids, and the boyfriend is pushing for them. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear from a young age that they don't want kids. They even screened their partners before, making sure they didn't want kids either. That shows they're being upfront, which is good. Now, in their current relationship of over five years, they're facing pressure from the boyfriend and his mom. The author is firm in their decision, even telling the boyfriend to leave if that's what he wants. \n\nFinancial reasons are mentioned as a factor, along with personal desire for dogs instead of children. The boyfriend's mom thinks the author doesn't love him because of this. But the author does love him, but the child-free stance is non-negotiable. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, personal choice regarding having children is a big deal. As long as they communicated their stance clearly and consistently, they're not wrong for standing their ground. The boyfriend might need to consider if he can accept that or not. The author isn't stringing him along; they've been honest. So, the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
