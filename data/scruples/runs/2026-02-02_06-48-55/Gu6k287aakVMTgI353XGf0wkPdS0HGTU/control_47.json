I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids and shutting down conversations about it in her long-term relationship. \n\nFirst, the author is in her mid-20s, has always known she doesn't want kids, and has been upfront with her boyfriend about it. They've been together over five years, and he's older. She's clear about her stance, even telling him to leave if he wants kids. He's making snippy comments, and his mom is upset, thinking she doesn't love him.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal choice and communication. The author is consistent in her decision and communicates it clearly. She's not trying to trick him into a lifestyle he doesn't want. The boyfriend's family and friends might have opinions, but the key is whether the author is wrong for not changing her mind or not entertaining the idea.\n\nFrom what I know, being upfront about not wanting kids is generally seen as responsible, especially in a long-term relationship. The author is respecting her own values and not pressuring the other person into something against her will. The boyfriend should have considered this before entering a long-term commitment. His comments and his mom's judgment don't make the author wrong. \n\nAlso, the practical aspects like financial instability and wanting dogs instead of kids are valid reasons. So, I think the author is in the right here. The answer should be B.\n"
