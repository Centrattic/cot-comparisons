I think they're very expensive, dirty, a lot of work, and just not worth it. so when I started dating I always make sure that the person I was with didn't didn't want kids, because I don't want to string anybody along and make them upset. \n\nBut I'm with my boyfriend  more than 5 years now he is older than me,and I've been getting snippy comments about the possibility of us having kids. Each time it comes up I shut that convo down. I once told him if kids is what he want he should leave bc I'm not going to do that.  His mom knows and thinks I don't love him. But I do, but we can not afford children we both work full-time and can't even afford our small apartment. It's unreasonable to have kids plus I want dogs not a life-time responsiblity. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting kids. The situation is that the author, a mid-20s woman, has always known she doesn't want children. She's been with her boyfriend for over five years, and he's been making comments about having kids. She shuts down the conversation and told him he should leave if that's what he wants. His mom thinks she doesn't love him, but she claims she does. They can't afford kids and she prefers dogs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is clear about her stance on kids from a young age and has been upfront with her partners. That's important because honesty in relationships is crucial. She's been with her boyfriend for a long time, which suggests a committed relationship. However, he's been bringing up the topic of kids, which she finds unacceptable. She's even told him he should leave if he wants kids. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have different values. Not wanting kids is a personal choice. If she communicated her stance early and consistently, it's not her fault if her partner isn't aligned with that. However, the fact that she told him to leave if he wanted kids might come off as harsh. But in a long-term relationship, compatibility on major issues like having kids is essential. If he can't accept her choice, then maybe it's his issue, not hers. \n\nHer financial situation is another point. They can't afford kids, which is a valid concern. Plus, she wants dogs instead. That's her preference. His mom's reaction doesn't change the fact that her decision is based on her own desires and circumstances. \n\nThe user might be looking for validation that her choice isn't wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether the author is being responsible by not pretending to want kids when she doesn't. Since she's upfront and their incompatibility is the root issue, she's probably not in the wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
