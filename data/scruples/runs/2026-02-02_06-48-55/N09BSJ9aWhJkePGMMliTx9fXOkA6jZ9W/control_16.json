Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person's brother-in-law, who they've known since kindergarten, is acting in a way that they find creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls her \"my Betsy,\" uses the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has her picture on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see the kid and ignores adults, FaceTimes every day, and even tried to visit when the parents were away. Plus, he has bad hygiene that's affecting their belongings and daughter.\n\nThe author confronted him, the brother-in-law got defensive and accused them of accusing him of child molestation. The sister-in-law is upset and cut off contact, making the wife sad because she might lose her sister over this. The author's friend also agreed that the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for speaking up. Let's break it down. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior towards a young child. The author is concerned about their daughter's well-being and safety. The actions described\u2014excessive attention, personal items with the child's photo, ignoring adults, and trying to visit when parents aren't there\u2014could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the age of the child. The author's response was to confront him, which led to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFrom a legal and social standpoint, any behavior that could be perceived as grooming or inappropriate attention towards a minor, especially a child, is taken very seriously. Even if there's no proof of molestation, the actions described are concerning. The author's duty to protect their child is paramount. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing concerns, especially since they have valid reasons. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction don't negate the initial concerns. The friend agreeing with the author's assessment adds credibility to their perspective.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They acted in the best interest of their child and family, and confronting the issue was necessary given the circumstances.\n"
