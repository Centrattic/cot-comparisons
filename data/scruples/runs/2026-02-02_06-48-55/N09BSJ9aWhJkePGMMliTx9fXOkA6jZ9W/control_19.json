Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a friend from childhood who's also his brother-in-law. This guy has been acting inappropriately towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. He calls her \"my Betsy,\" uses his own name as \"uncle,\" has her picture on his dashboard and phone screensaver, comes over just to see her, FaceTimes daily, ignores adults, and even went behind their backs to visit when they were out. Plus, his hygiene is terrible, causing issues.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law took offense, accusing him of calling him a child molester. Now the sister-in-law is cutting off communication, and the wife is upset about losing her sister. So the author is asking if they're in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the brother-in-law's actions are actually inappropriate. The examples given do seem concerning. Referring to a 3-year-old as \"my Betsy\" and having her as a screensaver might be crossing boundaries. Adults shouldn't fixate on young children in such a way. The author's concern about the behavior being creepy is valid, especially with actions like trying to see the child without the parents present. That could create an unsafe situation if the child is left alone with someone who has such intense focus on her.\n\nThen there's the hygiene issue, which is a separate problem but adds to the overall discomfort. The fact that the brother-in-law took offense to being confronted and escalated the conflict by being defensive and making accusations suggests he might be in denial about his own behavior.\n\nThe author's actions were to address the inappropriate behavior directly. Since the daughter is a child, the parents have the responsibility to protect her and set boundaries. Confronting someone who's acting in a way that's potentially harmful isn't wrong. The brother-in-law's reaction might be an overreaction, but that doesn't make the author wrong for standing up for their child.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it more carefully. For example, involving other family members or professionals first, but given the seriousness of the situation, especially the unauthorized visit during the parents' absence, the author had a right to step in. The key here is that the author was protecting a child from someone whose behavior was at minimum inconsiderate and potentially dangerous.\n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect their child from inappropriate attention, and the brother-in-law's behavior was the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
