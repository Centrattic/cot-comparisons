Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter. The brother-in-law has been acting in a way that seems over-attentive and maybe creepy, especially with a 3-year-old. The examples given include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her picture in his car and phone, visiting just to see her, and ignoring adults. There's also the incident where he tried to see the daughter without the parents' knowledge, and his poor hygiene that affected the child.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the brother-in-law's behavior towards a young child. Even if the intentions are innocent, the actions described can be seen as inappropriate. The author felt the need to address this because they perceived a threat or discomfort. The brother-in-law's reaction was defensive, leading to a broken relationship. The sister-in-law is upset and the wife is caught in the middle.\n\nThe author's actions were based on concern for their daughter's well-being. They tried to distance themselves first, then confronted the brother-in-law when he went behind their back. The friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate. So, the author isn't acting out of malice but genuine concern. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling accused without proof, but the author had valid reasons to be concerned. In these situations, protecting a child is paramount. The author isn't in the wrong for taking a stand against what they reasonably perceive as creepy behavior.\n"
