Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The examples given are pretty specific: calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using creepy nicknames, having photos of her on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, FaceTiming daily, and then going behind their backs to visit her when they were out of town. Plus, he has bad hygiene that's affecting the daughter. The writer confronted him, the brother-in-law got defensive, accused them of implying he was a molester, and now the sister-in-law is cutting off contact. The wife is upset because she might lose her sister.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the writer did something wrong. The key points here are the brother-in-law's behavior. The examples he provided seem inappropriate, especially given the age of the child. Using terms like \"my Betsy\" and keeping photos of a child on his dashboard and phone screen could be seen as overstepping. The daily FaceTime calls and going out of his way to see the child when the parents are away are also concerning. The writer's action was to confront him about this behavior, which led to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the possible reasons someone might think the writer is in the wrong. Maybe they overreacted? But the brother-in-law's actions are pretty clear in the story. The writer's concern is about their daughter's safety and well-being. Parents have the right to protect their children, and if they perceive someone's behavior as inappropriate or creepy, it's reasonable to address it. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the accusation of implying he's a molester might be his way of deflecting. The writer's friend also agreed with the assessment, so there's some corroboration.\n\nIs there a chance that the writer misinterpreted the behavior? Maybe, but the examples given are pretty specific and could be seen as crossing boundaries. The hygiene issue is another point that adds to the discomfort. The writer's action was to confront the brother-in-law, which is a direct approach, but given the circumstances, it might have been necessary. The alternative would be to let it continue, which could be risky for the child. \n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction might be more about defending her husband than the child's well-being. The writer isn't in the wrong here because they acted in their daughter's best interest. The brother-in-law's actions are questionable, and the writer had the right to address it. So the answer should be B, the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
