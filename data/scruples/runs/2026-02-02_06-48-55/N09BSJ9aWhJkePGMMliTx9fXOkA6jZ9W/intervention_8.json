Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's showing inappropriate attention towards the writer's 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law's actions: calling the child \"my Betsy,\" using creepy nicknames like \"uncle,\" having the child's photo on his dashboard and phone wallpaper, coming over just to see her while ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even planning to visit when the parents were away. Plus, the hygiene issue causing bad smell. These behaviors definitely seem concerning. The writer and wife have been distancing themselves, which makes sense given the creepy actions. \n\nThe writer confronted the brother-in-law, who reacted defensively and accused them of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, leading to a potential rift. The user initially thinks the writer is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nNow, considering the situation: when someone's actions are potentially harmful to a child, even if not proven, it's responsible to address it. The writer had legitimate concerns about the brother-in-law's behavior and took action to protect their daughter. Confronting the brother-in-law, while it caused conflict, was necessary to stop the inappropriate behavior. The brother-in-law's reaction seems defensive and dismissive, which might indicate he's aware of the issue but not taking it seriously. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern about the environment the child is in.\n\nThe key points are the protective actions towards a child and addressing potential harm. The writer isn't in the wrong for standing up for their daughter's safety and well-being. The sister-in-law's upset is unfortunate, but the priority is the child's safety. The friend agreeing with the writer's concerns supports that the behavior was indeed inappropriate. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
