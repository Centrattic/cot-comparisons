Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's become overly focused on their 3-year-old daughter, and the author confronted him, leading to a broken relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother-in-law is calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has a photo of her on his dashboard, phone screensaver, visits just to see her and ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even tried to visit when the author's family was away. Plus, his hygiene is bad, causing issues. The author confronted him, leading to defensiveness and the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to analyze whether the author overstepped or if their actions were justified.\n\nThe brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning. The actions described could be seen as inappropriate, especially the constant focus on a young child. The author addressed the behavior after finding out about the unauthorized visit. It's possible that the brother-in-law felt blindsided, leading to his defensive reaction. However, the author's main responsibility is to protect their daughter and family's safety and well-being. Confronting someone about behavior that could be harmful is a valid response. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling that the author accused her husband without sufficient proof, but given the examples provided, the author had cause to be concerned.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were justified. Since there are clear examples of the brother-in-law's behavior that could be considered inappropriate or creepy, the author had a right to express their concerns. The sister-in-law's anger might stem from defensiveness rather than valid reasons. The author's actions were aimed at protecting their daughter, which is a parent's responsibility. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
