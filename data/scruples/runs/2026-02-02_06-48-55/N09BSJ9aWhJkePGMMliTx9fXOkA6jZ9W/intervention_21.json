Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been showing a lot of attention towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The author feels it's inappropriate and confronts the friend, leading to a ruined relationship and tension with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother-in-law refers to the daughter using terms like \"my Betsy,\" has her picture on his dashboard, phone screensaver, and tries to FaceTime her every day. He's also coming over just to see the kid and ignoring adults. The author and his wife have been distancing themselves. Then, the brother-in-law made plans with the mother-in-law to see the daughter when they were out of town. The author found out and confronted him, leading to accusations of being a molester and the sister-in-law cutting off communication.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to check.\n\nSo, what's the main issue? The brother-in-law's behavior towards the child. The author is concerned it's inappropriate. The problem is whether the author overreacted or had a legitimate reason to confront.\n\nI need to think about appropriate boundaries. A 3-year-old is a minor, so any adult showing excessive focus, especially with terms of endearment and constant attention, could be seen as concerning. The brother-in-law's actions, like having the child's photo on his dashboard and screensaver, trying to see her daily, and ignoring others, might be a red flag. Also, the fact that he went behind their backs to see the child when they were away is a privacy and trust issue.\n\nHygiene issues are mentioned too, which might be a separate issue but adds to the overall discomfort. The author's reaction was to confront him, which led to the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a molester. That's a serious accusation, so maybe the confrontation was too direct or harsh? But on the other hand, the brother-in-law's behavior is already problematic.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for confronting him? If the behavior is inappropriate, the author has a duty to protect their child. However, confronting a close friend and relative could lead to conflict. But given the circumstances, maybe the author had to act to protect their daughter.\n\nThe key factors here are the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions and the manner in which the author addressed them. If the brother-in-law's behavior is indeed concerning, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. However, if the author overreacted without clear evidence, they might be at fault. The fact that another long-time friend agreed it was not appropriate supports the author's concern.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions seem justified to protect their daughter from what they perceive as inappropriate attention. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the subsequent fallout might be his responsibility, not the author's. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
