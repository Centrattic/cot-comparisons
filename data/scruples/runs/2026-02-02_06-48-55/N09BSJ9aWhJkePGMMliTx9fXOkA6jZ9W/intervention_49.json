Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a long-time friend and brother-in-law to his wife's sister. The sister-in-law's husband (the author's friend) has been showing excessive attention towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" using the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her picture on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see the daughter, ignoring adults, daily face-time requests, and even planning to visit the daughter without the author's knowledge while he was away. Additionally, the man's hygiene is so bad it's affecting their belongings. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now cutting off communication, and the author's wife is upset about possibly losing her sister.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Concern for Daughter's Well-being**: The author is worried about his daughter's safety and comfort. The friend's behavior is being perceived as inappropriate and potentially creepy, especially with actions like daily contact, exclusive attention, and having the child's image on personal devices. This could be a valid concern as parents have a duty to protect their children from any form of unwanted attention, especially from adults who may overstep boundaries.\n\n2. **Going Behind Their Backs**: The friend made plans with the mother-in-law to see the daughter without the author's knowledge. This is a breach of trust and could be seen as disregarding the author's and daughter's wishes, which is concerning.\n\n3. **Hygiene Issue**: The friend's poor hygiene is a separate issue but might contribute to the overall discomfort and could be a reason to limit interaction. However, it's a different type of problem compared to the attention towards the child.\n\n4. **Confrontation**: The author directly confronted the friend about his behavior. The friend became defensive and accused the author of implying he was a molester. The sister-in-law's reaction is also significant here. The author's action was a response to what he perceives as a threat to his daughter, which is a parent's instinct.\n\n5. **Relationship Impact**: The confrontation has led to a breakdown in the relationship between the author and his sister-in-law, and the wife is caught in the middle. However, the author's primary concern was for his daughter's safety, which is a valid reason.\n\nNow, considering these points: Is the author in the wrong for speaking up about the behavior he found concerning? From a protective parent's perspective, it's reasonable to address actions that seem inappropriate, especially when they involve a minor. The friend's behavior does cross lines that could make others uncomfortable, and the author's intervention was to protect his daughter. The sister-in-law's overreaction might be due to the accusation, but the author had a right to express his concerns to prevent any potential harm. The friend's hygiene issue adds another layer, but the main issue is the attention towards the child.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the author should have approached the situation more carefully, perhaps involving other family members or professionals before confronting the friend. But given the direct threat to his daughter's well-being, the author's action seems justified. The key here is whether the behavior was indeed inappropriate. If the friend's actions were objectively creepy, the author was right to act. If there was a misunderstanding, then perhaps the approach could have been different. But based on the examples given (calling her \"my Betsy,\" daily facetime, etc.), the behavior does seem off. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely not in the wrong for speaking out, as he was trying to protect his daughter. The sister-in-law's reaction is unfortunate, but the author had a valid reason to address the situation. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
