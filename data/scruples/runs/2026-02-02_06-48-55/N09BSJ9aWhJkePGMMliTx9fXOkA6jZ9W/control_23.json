Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a brother-in-law, who has been a friend since kindergarten. He married the author's wife's sister. Now, the brother-in-law has been acting in a way that the author and his wife find creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. Examples given are calling her \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her picture on the dashboard and as a screensaver, coming over just to see her while ignoring others, FaceTiming her every day, and even trying to see her while the author and wife were away, to the point of going behind their backs. Also, his bad hygiene is causing a smell problem.\n\nThe author confronted him, which led to the brother-in-law being defensive and claiming he's being accused of being a child molester. Now, the sister-in-law is upset and cutting off the relationship, which is making the author's wife sad, possibly losing her sister. The friend they confided in agreed the behavior wasn't appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate. Calling the child \"my Betsy\" and using \"uncle\" in a way that's considered creepy might be overstepping boundaries. Having a 3-year-old's photo on his dashboard and as a screensaver could be seen as excessive, especially since young children might not understand the dynamic here. Coming over to see the kid and ignoring adults is odd. Daily FaceTime with a toddler might be normal if it's a family member, but maybe the frequency and the way it's done (e.g., using the screensaver, dashboard photo) makes it seem obsessive. The fact that he went behind their backs to see the child when they were away adds a layer of secrecy, which is concerning.\n\nThe author's wife might be upset because losing her sister is a big deal, but the author felt compelled to act to protect his daughter. The friend's agreement supports the author's view that the behavior is not appropriate. The bad hygiene is a separate issue but might contribute to the overall discomfort.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for addressing this? Well, even if the confrontation was harsh, the underlying issue seems to be valid. The brother-in-law's behavior likely crosses a social boundary, and the author has a responsibility to protect his child. However, the way the author handled it (calling him out for being \"creepy\" and leading to accusations of molestation) might have been too confrontational, causing unnecessary harm. But the core of the issue is the inappropriate behavior towards the child. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister's reaction don't absolve him of potential wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the author probably isn't in the wrong for addressing the behavior, especially since it's about a minor. The brother-in-law's actions are more concerning. The key here is that the author acted out of concern for his daughter's safety and well-being, even if it led to a breakdown in the relationship. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
