Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards the writer's daughter, and the writer confronted him, leading to a rift with their sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The brother-in-law has a 3-year-old niece. He calls her \"my Betsy,\" uses a creepy uncle term, has her photo on his dashboard and phone, visits just to see her and ignores adults, FaceTimes every day, and even went to see her when the parents were out of town. Plus, his hygiene is bad, causing issues. The writer confronted him, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset and cutting off contact.\n\nSo the question is whether the writer did the right thing by speaking up. Let's break it down. The brother-in-law's behavior is the main issue. The writer's actions were in response to this. The key factors are whether the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate and if the writer's response was justified.\n\nThe brother-in-law's actions seem over the line. Having a minor child's photo as a screensaver and dashboard, visiting solely to see her, ignoring adults, daily FaceTime\u2014these could be signs of inappropriate attachment. The hygiene issue is another red flag. The writer's concern for their daughter's safety and well-being is valid. Parents have the right to control who interacts with their children. The brother-in-law's actions going behind their backs to see the daughter exacerbate the problem.\n\nThe writer's confrontation, while leading to a fallout, was about protecting their child. Even if the brother-in-law felt accused, the writer's intent was to address the concerning behavior. The friend agreeing that it was inappropriate supports the writer's perspective. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to her brother's defensiveness, but the writer isn't necessarily at fault here. They acted in their daughter's best interest. So, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
