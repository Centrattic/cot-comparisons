Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards the author's daughter. The brother-in-law has been calling the 3-year-old \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself as her uncle in a creepy way, has her picture on his dashboard, uses it as his phone wallpaper, comes over just to see her, ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even made plans with the mother-in-law to see the daughter when the author and his wife were out.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law lashing out by accusing him of accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The author's friend also agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The key points are the inappropriate behavior towards a child, which is a serious concern. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a minor. The author's responsibility as a parent is to protect their child from any potential harm, even if it's not a criminal act yet. The fact that the brother-in-law went behind their backs to see the daughter adds to the concern about his intentions.\n\nThe author confronting him directly was a necessary step to address the behavior. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and accusation might be a way to deflect from the issue. The sister-in-law's reaction could be due to feeling that her husband was unfairly accused, but given the evidence of his strange behavior, the author had a legitimate reason to act.\n\nHygiene issues, like the smell affecting the couch and the daughter, are also a problem, but the main issue is the focus on the child. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their daughter's well-being. The sister-in-law's sister might be overreacting, but the author wasn't wrong to address the situation that could be harmful. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
