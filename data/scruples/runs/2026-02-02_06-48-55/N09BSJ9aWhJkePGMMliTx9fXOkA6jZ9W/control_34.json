Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the story is at fault for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is the brother-in-law, married to the sister of the author's wife. The author has known him since childhood, and they're both almost 40. The brother-in-law has been showing excessive attention to the author's 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself in a creepy way, having her picture on his dashboard and phone, visiting just to see her, FaceTiming every day, and even going behind the author's back to see the daughter when they were out of town. Additionally, there's the issue of his bad hygiene affecting the daughter.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law, who became defensive and accused the author of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, leading to a rift in the family. The author is worried about his wife's relationship with her sister.\n\nNow, the key points here are about appropriate boundaries and the author's responsibility to protect their child. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as inappropriate, especially with a young child. The author's reaction is to address this behavior directly, which might have been intense but necessary given the potential risk to the child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate and the author felt they had to intervene to protect their daughter, then the author might not be at fault. However, if the author's approach was confrontational without giving the brother-in-law a chance to explain or change his ways, maybe there's room for a different approach. But given the examples provided, the behavior seems to cross a line, and the author's responsibility as a parent is to act in their child's best interest.\n\nAlso, the brother-in-law's defensive reaction and denial might indicate he's not acknowledging the problem. The author's friend also agreed the behavior wasn't appropriate, which supports the author's perspective.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely B (author is not in the wrong) because the author is protecting their child from what they perceive as inappropriate behavior, even if it caused a family rift. The alternative would be if the behavior wasn't actually inappropriate, but the examples given do suggest concerning actions towards a minor.\n"
