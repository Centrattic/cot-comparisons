Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for confronting his brother-in-law about his behavior towards his daughter. The brother-in-law is a friend from childhood, married to the sister of the author's wife. The brother-in-law has been showing excessive attention to the author's 3-year-old daughter\u2014calling her by a nickname, using his phone and dashboard with her pictures, coming over just to see her, and even planning to visit without the author's knowledge. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The brother-in-law's actions are definitely concerning. Referring to a young child with terms of endearment typically reserved for romantic partners, having her as a screensaver, and visiting just to see her could be seen as inappropriate, especially if it's to the point of ignoring others and causing discomfort. The author's main concern is that this behavior is \"creepy\" and possibly a sign of inappropriate attachment. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and accusation of molestation might be an overreaction, but the author's actions were in response to observed behavior that others also agreed was not appropriate.\n\nThe key points here are the brother-in-law's actions. The author is acting as a parent to protect his daughter. The brother-in-law's planning to see the child without the author's knowledge adds to the concern. The author's confrontation was to address what he perceives as a threat to his family, even if it caused a rift. The brother-in-law's reaction is extreme, but the author had to take a stand to protect his child. Since others also validated the concern, the author isn't acting without reason. Therefore, the author is in the right to speak up about his daughter's well-being.\n"
