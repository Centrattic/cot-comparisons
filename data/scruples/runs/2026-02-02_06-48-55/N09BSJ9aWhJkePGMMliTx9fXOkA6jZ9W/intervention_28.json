Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has shown excessive attention towards the writer's 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having the daughter's picture as a screensaver, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. There's also an incident where he tried to see the daughter when the parents were out, leading to the writer confronting him.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The brother-in-law's behavior is being described as creepy and inappropriate. The author took action by confronting him, which led to the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is concerned about losing her sister. The friend agrees the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nFrom a personal safety and child protection standpoint, the author has a responsibility to protect their daughter. The brother-in-law's actions\u2014focusing solely on the child, using terms that might be seen as overly affectionate, making plans to see the child without consent\u2014could be seen as concerning. The hygiene issue adds to the discomfort, as it's a health and safety issue.\n\nHowever, the confrontation method is important. The author called out the behavior, leading to defensiveness. Did the author handle it appropriately? Maybe they could have approached it more carefully, but given the circumstances, the action was about protecting their child. The brother-in-law's reaction might be extreme, but the author's concerns are valid.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents have the right to protect their children from any behavior that's even questionable. The brother-in-law's actions, while not proven to be criminal, are at least inappropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling attacked, but the author's intent was to protect the child.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author acted in their daughter's best interest and had legitimate concerns.\n"
