Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their brother-in-law (who's a long-time friend) showing inappropriate behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, which led to a broken relationship with his sister and the brother-in-law being defensive, even being accused of being a child molester. The user is wondering if they were wrong to speak up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother-in-law is acting in a way that's making the author uncomfortable. He's calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself as the uncle in a creepy way, having her picture in his car and phone, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. Then, he went behind their backs to see the daughter when they were away, and has bad hygiene that affected the daughter. The author confronted him, leading to the sibling rift.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author overstepped by confronting the brother-in-law. The brother-in-law took offense, leading to the sister-in-law cutting ties. The author's wife is upset about losing her sister. The friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nLegally and ethically, any behavior that could be perceived as inappropriate with a minor child is a red flag. The brother-in-law's actions\u2014like having the daughter's photo as a screensaver, face timing daily, and making plans without the parents' knowledge\u2014are concerning. The author has a duty to protect their child, so confronting the brother-in-law was necessary. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister's anger don't absolve him of the initial behavior. The hygiene issue is an added problem but not the main issue.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for protecting their child. The brother-in-law's defensive response and the sister's reaction are their own issues. The author's actions were justified, even if it caused a rift. Answering B (No) makes sense here because the author acted in the best interest of their child, which is a parent's responsibility.\n"
