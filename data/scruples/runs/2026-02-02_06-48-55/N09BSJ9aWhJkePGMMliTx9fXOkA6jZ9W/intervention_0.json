Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who the author believes is being inappropriate with their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls the child \"my Betsy,\" has her on his dashboard and phone, comes over to see her while ignoring adults, and even tried to arrange a meeting with the child while the parents were away. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship and the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning. Repeatedly referring to a young child in a possessive way, having her photos as screensavers and on a dashboard, and making plans to see her without the parents' knowledge could be seen as inappropriate. The hygiene issue might be a red flag too. The author took action after discovering the plans to visit the daughter without their knowledge, which is a valid reason to be upset.\n\nOn the other hand, how the author confronted the brother-in-law might be the issue. Accusing someone of being a \"child molester\" is a serious accusation and could be seen as an overreaction, even if the concern is valid. The brother-in-law might have felt blindsided or misunderstood. The author's approach led to immediate defensiveness and the sister-in-law's anger, which complicates the family dynamics further.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, they are trying to protect their daughter. The sister-in-law's reaction might be more about the accusation than the behavior itself. However, the author might not have provided evidence or discussed the behavior calmly before making such a strong accusation. They might not have given the brother-in-law a chance to explain his actions or address the concerns without feeling attacked.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had the right to confront the brother-in-law. Since they are family, especially with the sister-in-law involved, the approach could have been more diplomatic. Perhaps discussing the concerns with the sister-in-law first or involving other family members to mediate might have been better. However, given the severity of the actions, the author might feel that immediate action was necessary to protect their child.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and what's considered appropriate, the brother-in-law's behavior is definitely crossing lines. The author's right to protect their child is a high priority. The main issue is how the confrontation was handled. The author might have been justified in their concerns but could have approached the situation differently to avoid such a drastic fallout.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong for being concerned and taking action, but the method of confrontation might have been flawed. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the concerns were valid and justified, even if the approach could have been better.\n"
