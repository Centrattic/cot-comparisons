Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law is a long-time friend but has become their sister's husband. The key issue is his focus on the 3-year-old daughter. Examples given include nicknames like \"my Betsy,\" using the dashboard and phone screensaver with her photos, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. The author found out he was planning to visit the daughter while they were away, which led to the confrontation. The brother-in-law reacted defensively, accusing the author of calling him a child molester, leading to a breakdown in the relationship with the sister.\n\nThe question is whether the author did the right thing by speaking up. Let's consider the points. The brother-in-law's behavior seems to cross boundaries. Referring to a 3-year-old in a possessive way, using personal items as screen savers, and seeking unsupervised time could be seen as inappropriate. The author's main concern is their daughter's safety and well-being. Confronting someone about behavior that feels creepy is reasonable, especially when it's their own child involved.\n\nHowever, the brother-in-law's reaction might suggest that the author's approach was too harsh. But given the examples, the author had valid concerns. The key here is whether the author had a reasonable belief that the brother-in-law's actions were inappropriate. Since the friend confirmed the behavior was not okay, the author wasn't just being paranoid. The brother-in-law's defense and the sister's reaction might indicate that the confrontation was necessary but perhaps handled in a way that escalated tensions.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's primary duty is to their child's safety. Even if the confrontation caused a rift, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their daughter's well-being. The brother-in-law's actions, even if not criminal, are concerning and crossing social boundaries. So the author is justified in speaking up. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
