Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law developing an infatuation with the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The friend refers to her with terms like \"my Betsy,\" has her picture on his dashboard and phone, visits just to see her, and ignores adults. There's also the issue of bad hygiene leading to smells on the couch and the daughter. The writer confronted the friend, who got defensive and accused them of implying he's a child molester, causing a rift with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior toward a 3-year-old is definitely concerning. Using terms of endearment that are more adult, having her image as a screensaver, and going out of his way to see her when the parents aren't there could be seen as inappropriate. The writer's main concern is protecting their daughter, which is a parent's duty. The friend's defense and the sister-in-law's reaction suggest that the confrontation was intense, but the writer's actions were based on genuine concerns. The friend's hygiene is another issue, but the main problem is the focus on the child. The writer isn't in the wrong for addressing inappropriate behavior that could potentially harm their child. The answer should be B (No).\n"
