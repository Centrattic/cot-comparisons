Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person has a friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that's making them uncomfortable around their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls the kid \"my Betsy,\" uses her as his screensaver, has a picture on his dashboard, comes over just to see her, FaceTimes every day, and even went behind their backs to see her when they were away. Plus, he smells bad and left his BO on the kid.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law got defensive, calling it an accusation of being a child molester. Now the sister-in-law is upset and won't talk to them, causing a rift. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's behavior is genuinely inappropriate. The examples given do sound concerning. Referring to a child as \"my Betsy\" and having her as a screensaver might be overstepping. Constantly seeking attention from a 3-year-old, especially to the point of ignoring adults, could be seen as crossing boundaries. The fact that he went behind their backs to visit the child while they were gone adds to the concern. The hygiene issue might be a red herring, but the smell could be a health or safety issue too.\n\nThe author's actions were to confront the brother-in-law about the behavior they found creepy. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's subsequent anger are part of the fallout. But the key is whether the author was justified in confronting him. Since the brother-in-law's actions could be interpreted as inappropriate, especially around a child, the author has a valid reason to express concern. However, the way they confronted him might have been harsh if they didn't give him a chance to explain. But given the examples, it seems like the author had legitimate concerns.\n\nThe friend's agreement that the behavior was not appropriate supports the author's stance. Also, the brother-in-law's immediate defensiveness and the accusation of being a child molester suggest he might have been in the wrong. The author's intention was to protect their daughter, which is a parent's responsibility. So, the author likely isn't in the wrong for acting to protect their child's well-being. The brother-in-law's actions are the main issue here.\n"
