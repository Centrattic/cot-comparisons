Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has her photo on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see her and ignores adults, FaceTimes every day, and even went behind their backs to see the daughter when they were away. Plus, he has bad hygiene that affects the daughter.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law got defensive, accusing the author of calling him a child molester. Now the sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother-in-law's actions. The examples given do seem concerning. A 3-year-old is very young, and someone fixating on them with daily contact, personal photos, and ignoring adults could be a red flag. The hygiene issue is also a problem, especially affecting the child.\n\nThe author's actions were to confront him. The brother-in-law's reaction was defensive and possibly over the top. The key question is whether the author had a right to address the behavior they found inappropriate. Since the author is a parent, they have a responsibility to protect their child. If they felt the brother-in-law's actions were inappropriate and potentially harmful, confronting him might be justified.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it more carefully. Accusations of being a child molester without evidence could be damaging. But the brother-in-law's own behavior was problematic. The author did mention that a friend agreed the behavior was not appropriate, supporting their concerns.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is trying to protect their daughter from what they see as harmful behavior. The brother-in-law's actions were questionable, and the author's response, while maybe intense, was in response to those issues. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
