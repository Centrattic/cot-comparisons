Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author is a close friend and brother-in-law to his wife's sister. The brother-in-law has been showing a lot of attention towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. Examples given include calling her \"my Betsy,\" using the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her photo on his dashboard and phone, making plans to see her when the parents are away, and even leaving his bad odor on the kid. The author confronted him, leading to a fallout in the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions and whether the author overstepped by confronting him. The brother-in-law's behavior seems excessive. Having a child's photo on dashboard and screensaver, making daily FaceTimes, and coming over just to see the child while ignoring adults could be concerning. The author's action was to call him out, which led to defensiveness and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is caught in the middle.\n\nNow, considering boundaries, parents have the right to protect their children. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as inappropriate, especially the behind-the-back plans. The author's confrontation was to address these concerns. While the approach might have been harsh, the underlying issue is valid. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction might be due to feeling accused without proper evidence, but the author's intent was to protect his daughter.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is acting in his child's best interest. However, the way he addressed it might have been abrupt. But given the situation, it's a valid concern. So the author isn't in the wrong for addressing the inappropriate behavior.\n"
