Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has become overly focused on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior: calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy uncle persona, having her picture on his dashboard and phone screen, visiting just to see her while ignoring others, daily FaceTimes, planning to see her when the author and wife were away, and bad hygiene causing smells on the child.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being accused of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, cutting off communication, and the wife is distressed. The friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author overstepped. The brother-in-law's actions seem concerning. A 3-year-old is a minor, and any adult showing excessive, one-sided interest in a child of that age can be problematic. The examples given\u2014possessive nicknames, exclusive focus, daily contact, visiting behind the family's back\u2014are all red flags for inappropriate behavior. The hygiene issue adds another layer of risk, as it could harm the child's health.\n\nThe author's responsibility to protect their daughter is paramount. They have a right to address behavior they perceive as threatening or harmful, especially when it involves someone in their close family. Confronting the brother-in-law was necessary to ensure their child's safety and well-being. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction don't negate the potential harm in his actions. The friend's agreement supports the author's perspective as well.\n\nHowever, the author should consider if their approach was constructive. Maybe a more private or less confrontational approach could have been tried first, but given the severity and persistence of the behavior, direct confrontation might be justified. The key is whether the brother-in-law's actions are genuinely inappropriate and a threat, which they seem to be. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their child.\n"
