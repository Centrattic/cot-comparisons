Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the specific behaviors mentioned. The brother-in-law refers to the daughter with pet names, has her photos as a screensaver and dashboard, visits just to see the kid while ignoring adults, FaceTimes daily, and even tried to come over when the author's family was away. Plus, there's the hygiene issue causing bad smell. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nNow, considering the context: a 3-year-old is very young. The brother-in-law's focus on her seems excessive. The actions described\u2014like having her photo in prominent places, daily contact, and wanting to see her when parents aren't there\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. The hygiene problem adds another layer of concern, as it affects the child's environment.\n\nThe author's response was to call out the behavior. The key here is whether the author overstepped. Since the brother-in-law's actions are concerning and the author is the parent, it's reasonable to address it. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and escalation to a molestation accusation might indicate he was aware his behavior was questionable. The friend agreeing it's inappropriate supports the author's perspective.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a responsibility to protect their daughter. The brother-in-law's actions were the problem, not the author's response. Therefore, answer B.\n"
