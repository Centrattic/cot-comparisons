Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's becoming overly focused on the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The examples given are pretty specific: calling her \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her picture on his dashboard and phone screensaver, coming over just to see the kid and ignoring adults, FaceTiming daily, and even trying to visit when the parents are away. There's also the issue of his bad hygiene affecting the daughter.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law reacting defensively and even implying he was accused of being a molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are whether the brother-in-law's behavior is inappropriate and if the author had a right to confront him. The examples do sound concerning. A 3-year-old is a young child, and any adult showing excessive, one-sided focus on a child, especially with possessive nicknames and constant contact, can be a red flag. The fact that the author's friend also agreed it was inappropriate suggests it's not just their perception.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been harsh. Calling someone out for \"creepy\" behavior could be seen as accusatory, especially if the brother-in-law didn't realize his actions were crossing a line. But given the specific examples, the author had a legitimate concern. The brother-in-law going behind their backs to see the daughter when they were away is a privacy issue and could be seen as manipulative or inappropriate. \n\nThe author's wrongness would depend on if their confrontation was justified. Since the behavior included neglecting hygiene around a child and possibly overstepping boundaries, the author had a valid reason to address it. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's fallout are part of the consequences, but the root issue is the brother-in-law's actions. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their child and addressing concerning behavior, even if it strained relationships. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
