Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault. The author's friend/brother-in-law has been acting in a way that's making them uncomfortable around his niece. Examples include calling her by a term of endearment, having her pictures on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. The brother-in-law even tried to go behind their backs to spend time with the daughter while they were away. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the brother-in-law's behavior is inappropriate. The examples given\u2014excessive focus on a 3-year-old, using terms like \"my Betsy,\" having personal photos, visiting just to see her, and ignoring others\u2014could be seen as concerning. Especially since the author mentions a strong reaction (smell affecting the couch, BO on the kid) and the brother-in-law's own acknowledgment of being accused of child molestation, which is a serious accusation. \n\nThe author's action was confronting the brother-in-law. The question is if that was wrong. The brother-in-law's defensive response and the fallout might suggest that the author was right to speak up. The sister-in-law's reaction is also important. If the brother-in-law's behavior is crossing boundaries, the author has a responsibility to protect their daughter and set limits. \n\nHygiene issues are another point. The smell being so bad it affects property and the child\u2014this is a legitimate concern beyond just creepy behavior. \n\nThe friend agreeing that the behavior wasn't appropriate supports the author's perspective. The author didn't keep quiet until there was evidence of a crime, but they acted on their concerns when the situation escalated (like the brother-in-law trying to see the daughter when they weren't home). \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Confronting someone in a way that's accusatory might lead to defensiveness. Perhaps approaching the sister-in-law first, or involving a mediator. But given the context, the author's actions were to protect their child, which is a valid reason. The brother-in-law's reaction might have been inevitable given how the confrontation was handled, but the core issue was the inappropriate behavior. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The brother-in-law's actions were problematic, and the author had a duty to address it. The answer is B.\n"
