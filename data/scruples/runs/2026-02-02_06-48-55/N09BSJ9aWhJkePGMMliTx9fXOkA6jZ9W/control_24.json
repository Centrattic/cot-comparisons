Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting his brother-in-law about his behavior towards his 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law, who's been a friend since kindergarten, has been acting in ways that the family finds creepy. Examples include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using a picture of her as a screensaver, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, trying to FaceTime daily, and even making plans to visit during the parents' absence. Plus, his hygiene is terrible, leading to issues like smelly couches and the daughter.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law, who then got defensive and accused him of implying child molestation. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The friend agrees that the behavior is inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's actions seem to cross boundaries. Referring to a child that way, keeping a screensaver with the child, and making unilateral plans to visit the child without the parents' consent are concerning. The hygiene issue adds another layer of discomfort, especially since it affects the child.\n\nThe author's decision to confront him directly is a response to what he and others see as inappropriate behavior. Even though the brother-in-law reacted defensively and misunderstood the accusation as a serious allegation, the author's intent was to address concerning behavior that could affect the child's well-being.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped or was within his right to act. The behavior described is indeed problematic from a social and possibly legal standpoint. Parents have the right to protect their children from any behavior that makes them uncomfortable or violates boundaries. The author's friend also agreed it was inappropriate, supporting the author's perspective.\n\nHowever, the confrontation might have been handled more delicately. Instead of directly accusing him of being a \"child molester,\" which is a serious accusation and could be taken as a slur, the author could have focused on the specific behaviors and their impact. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction might have been mitigated with a different approach, but the core issue of the behavior remains.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for addressing the inappropriate actions of his brother-in-law, even if the confrontation led to a breakdown in the relationship. The priority is the child's safety and well-being, and the author acted to protect his daughter from what he perceives as a concerning situation.\n"
