Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author's brother-in-law has been showing excessive and creepy behavior towards his 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls her \"my Betsy,\" uses the phone's screensaver with her picture, comes over just to see her, and even tried to visit while they were away. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's actions are inappropriate. The examples given do seem concerning. Referring to a young child in a possessive way, having her picture on the dashboard and phone, coming over specifically to see her, and ignoring adults could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The fact that the brother-in-law is going behind the author's back to see the child while they're away adds to the concern.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law about the behavior. The brother-in-law reacted defensively, even equating the accusation to being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now cutting off contact, causing the author's wife distress. The author is worried about being at fault here.\n\nLegally and ethically, the brother-in-law's actions might not meet the threshold for criminal behavior, but they are definitely inappropriate. Parents have the right to protect their children from any behavior that makes them uncomfortable or seems predatory. The author had a right to address the behavior to ensure their daughter's safety and well-being.\n\nThe brother-in-law's reaction, however, was to become defensive and escalate the situation. The author's confrontation was justified given the circumstances. The fact that a long-time friend also agreed the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's stance.\n\nSo considering all this, the author is not in the wrong for standing up for their daughter and addressing the behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
