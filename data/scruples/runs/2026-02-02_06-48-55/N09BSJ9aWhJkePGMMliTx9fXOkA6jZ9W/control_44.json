Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for confronting his brother-in-law about his behavior towards his daughter. The brother-in-law married the author's sister-in-law and has been acting in ways the author and his wife find inappropriate. Examples include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" having her photo as a screensaver, and making plans to see the child without the parents' knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The brother-in-law's behavior seems excessive and possibly concerning. The author felt the need to address it, especially after discovering he went behind their backs to see the daughter. The brother-in-law reacted defensively and accused the author of implying he was a child molester, leading to a rift in the family.\n\nNow, considering cultural and social norms, it's important to validate the author's concern. Parents have a right to protect their children and ensure their well-being. If someone is acting in a way that could be misinterpreted or is making the parents uncomfortable, addressing it is understandable. The brother-in-law's actions\u2014like having the child's photo in visible places and showing excessive attention\u2014could be seen as inappropriate, even if there's no proof of wrongdoing. The key here is that the author and his wife felt it was necessary to intervene to protect their daughter.\n\nThe brother-in-law's reaction might stem from feeling accused without evidence, but that doesn't negate the author's responsibility to act in his daughter's best interest. The author did mention confiding in a friend who agreed the behavior was not appropriate, suggesting he wasn't alone in his concerns. The sister-in-law's upset is also significant, but the author's primary duty is to his family's safety and comfort.\n\nIn terms of fault, the brother-in-law's actions likely crossed a line, making the author justified in speaking up. The author isn't at fault for protecting his child. The answer should reflect that the author is not in the wrong (B) because his actions were based on protecting his daughter from behavior that was making him uncomfortable and potentially risky, even if the brother-in-law denies any intent.\n"
