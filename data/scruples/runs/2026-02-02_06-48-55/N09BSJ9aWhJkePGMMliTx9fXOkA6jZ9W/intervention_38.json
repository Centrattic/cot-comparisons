Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has shown excessive, possibly inappropriate attention towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the man's behavior: calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy tone, having her photo on his dashboard and phone, visiting to see her while ignoring adults, trying to FaceTime daily, and going behind their backs to visit when they were away. Additionally, his hygiene issues caused a smell problem.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction where the brother-in-law accused the author of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions. The behavior described\u2014excessive focus on a child, especially a 3-year-old, using terms of endearment that might be overstepping, and trying to spend time solely with the child\u2014can be seen as concerning. The hygiene aspect adds another layer of discomfort. The author's decision to confront him seems justified because they felt their daughter's safety and well-being were at risk.\n\nThe brother-in-law's reaction is problematic. Getting defensive and misinterpreting the accusation as a claim of being a molester might indicate he's aware that his behavior crosses boundaries. The sister-in-law's reaction suggests she might not see the issue, leading to the rift.\n\nThe author's actions were to protect their daughter, which is a parent's responsibility. Even if the confrontation caused tension, the priority is the child's safety. The brother-in-law's behavior needed addressing, and the author's friend agreed it was inappropriate. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for speaking up. The brother-in-law is likely at fault here for his actions, not the author for confronting them.\n"
