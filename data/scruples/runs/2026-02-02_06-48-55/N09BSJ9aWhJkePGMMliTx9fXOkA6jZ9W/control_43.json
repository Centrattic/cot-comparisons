Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's acting inappropriately towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The key points here are the friend's behavior: calling the daughter his own (\"my Betsy\"), using the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her photo as his screensaver, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even planning to visit when the parents are away. Plus, there's the issue with his hygiene affecting the child.\n\nFirst, the author confronts the friend about these behaviors, which the friend takes as an accusation of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, leading to a rift. The question is whether the author was wrong to speak up.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, any behavior that makes a parent uncomfortable, especially involving a young child, is cause for concern. The friend's actions are definitely over the line. The author had a duty to protect their daughter and address the inappropriate behavior. The friend's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction are on them. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their child's well-being. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern for the child's health. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
