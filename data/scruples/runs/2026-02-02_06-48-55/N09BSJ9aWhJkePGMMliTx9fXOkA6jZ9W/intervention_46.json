Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The friend, who's been around since kindergarten (almost 40 years), married the sister of the author's wife. Over the past year, he's shown excessive focus on the daughter, including using nicknames, having her photos on his phone and dashboard, FaceTiming daily, coming over just to see her, and ignoring others. The author found out he planned to visit their daughter while they were away, and he has poor hygiene that affected their home. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and the brother-in-law accusing them of implying he's a molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nNow, considering the actions: The author's concern is about the brother-in-law's behavior towards their young daughter. The examples given could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a minor. The author's actions were to confront the friend about this, which is a natural response to protect their child. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the accusation of implying he's a molester is a serious counter-accusation, but the author was addressing specific, observable behaviors.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author's primary role is to protect their child. The behaviors described, while not necessarily illegal, are concerning and could be considered inappropriate. The author had a right to express their discomfort, especially when the brother-in-law was going behind their backs. However, the confrontation might have been handled more tactfully to avoid escalation. But the core issue is the brother-in-law's actions, not the author's response to protect their daughter.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
