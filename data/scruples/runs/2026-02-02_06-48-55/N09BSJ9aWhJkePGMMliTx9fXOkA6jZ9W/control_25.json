Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong, with options A or B. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards his 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend refers to the daughter as \"my Betsy,\" uses creepy terms like \"uncle,\" has her picture on his dashboard and phone, ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even tried to visit when the parents were out of town. Plus, his hygiene is bad, which affects the daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship and the sister-in-law cutting off contact. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nNow, considering the actions of the brother-in-law. The behaviors described could be seen as inappropriate, especially given the child is only three. Referring to a young child as \"Betsy\" might be endearing to some, but combined with other actions like having the child's photo on a dashboard and phone, and FaceTiming daily, it crosses into stalker-like behavior. The fact that he went behind their backs to visit the daughter while they were away is a red flag. The author's action was to confront this, which is a protective measure for their child.\n\nThe brother-in-law's reaction was defensive and he accused the author of implying he's a child molester. That's a serious accusation, but the author's intent was to address the behavior, not make that claim. The sister-in-law being upset and cutting off contact is a consequence, but the author's primary concern would be the safety and well-being of their daughter. The friend they talked to also agreed the behavior was inappropriate, which supports the author's perspective.\n\nLegally, if someone is behaving in a way that could be considered harassment or is a safety risk for a minor, the parent has a right to address it. The author isn't making a false accusation but is protecting their child. The brother-in-law's actions, while not necessarily illegal (without more evidence), are definitely concerning and warrant a conversation. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their child and setting boundaries, even if it caused a rift in the family. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
