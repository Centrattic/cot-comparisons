Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person's friend and brother-in-law has been acting in a way that the author considers creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. Examples given include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, FaceTiming daily, and even trying to visit when the author and wife were away, leaving a bad smell on their couch and daughter.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law about this behavior, which led to the brother-in-law getting defensive and the sister-in-law cutting off communication. The author is asking if they're at fault for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions. The behaviors described could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a young child. The key here is whether the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate or just friendly. The author and their wife perceive it as creepy, but maybe others might see it as just being close to the niece. However, the fact that the brother-in-law went behind their backs to visit the daughter while they were away is a red flag. That suggests he's not respecting their boundaries and possibly overstepping.\n\nThe hygiene issue is another point. While not directly related to the daughter, it adds to the overall discomfort and could be seen as a personal problem that affects others (like the couch smell and the child's exposure to his body odor). \n\nNow, when the author confronted him, the brother-in-law reacted defensively and accused the author of implying he's a child molester. That's a serious accusation and might indicate that the brother-in-law was aware his behavior was crossing lines. The sister-in-law's reaction is also significant\u2014she might have been in denial about her husband's behavior, leading to the fallout.\n\nThe author's actions: by speaking up, they were trying to protect their daughter and set boundaries. Even if it caused a rift with the sister-in-law, protecting a child's well-being is a priority. The brother-in-law's actions could be legally questionable if they're grooming behavior, but without explicit evidence of abuse, it's hard to say. However, the described actions are definitely concerning and the author has a right to address them to protect their family.\n\nThe friend who agreed the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's stance. So the author isn't being unreasonable. They had a duty to act in their daughter's best interest. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's loss of composure might be due to their inability to handle criticism or denial about his behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for confronting the inappropriate behavior. The brother-in-law's actions warranted the confrontation, and the author had a responsibility to protect their child. The fallout with the sister-in-law is unfortunate but not the author's fault. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
