Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy regarding their 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior: calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself creepily as \"uncle,\" having her picture on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her and ignoring others, video calling every day, and trying to see her when the parents are away. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was justified in confronting the brother-in-law. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The examples given do seem inappropriate for a 3-year-old\u2014excessive focus, personal items, ignoring others, daily contact. The hygiene issue is also a problem but maybe secondary. The brother-in-law's reaction was defensive and he accused the author of implying he's a child molester, which is a serious accusation.\n\nThe author's actions were to confront the brother-in-law when they felt the behavior was crossing a line. The question is whether the confrontation was justified. In many cases, if someone is behaving in a way that makes others uncomfortable, especially regarding a child, it's reasonable to address it. However, the brother-in-law might have felt blindsided or accused without prior warning. The author might have considered addressing the behavior gradually or discussing it with the wife and sister-in-law first before confronting the brother-in-law directly.\n\nBut given that the brother-in-law was going behind their backs to see the daughter, which adds to the concern, the author might have felt it was necessary to act. The key is whether the behavior was indeed inappropriate and the confrontation was a reasonable response. The friend agreeing with the author suggests others see the behavior as off. The author's main concern is for their daughter's well-being, so acting to protect the child is a valid reason.\n\nHowever, the author could have approached it differently. Maybe discussing it with their wife and sister-in-law first to present a united front, or giving the brother-in-law a chance to explain before accusations. But given the situation, the author might have felt it was urgent to stop the behavior, especially with the secret plans to see the daughter.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the author was addressing inappropriate behavior that could affect their child's safety and well-being. The confrontation, while leading to conflict, was based on legitimate concerns. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction doesn't negate the potential issues with his actions.\n"
