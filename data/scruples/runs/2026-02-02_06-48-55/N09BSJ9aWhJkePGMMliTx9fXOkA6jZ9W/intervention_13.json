Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter. The situation is complicated because the brother-in-law is a long-time friend and has been acting in a way that the family finds creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother-in-law refers to the daughter as \"my Betsy,\" has a photo of her on his dashboard, comes over just to see her, FaceTimes daily, and even went behind their backs to spend time with her when they were out of town. Plus, his hygiene is bad, which adds to the discomfort. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and family tension.\n\nThe author's actions were based on concern for their daughter's safety and well-being. They noticed concerning behavior over time and decided to address it after the brother-in-law made plans without their knowledge. The brother-in-law took it as an accusation of child molestation, which is a serious charge, but the author didn't actually say that. However, the brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction suggest that the conversation might have been mishandled.\n\nBut was the author in the wrong for speaking up? Well, protecting a child from someone who behaves in a way that could be creepy is a parent's responsibility. The brother-in-law's actions, while not necessarily illegal, are certainly inappropriate and could create an uncomfortable environment for the child. The author didn't make false accusations but pointed out the behavior that they found concerning. The brother-in-law's reaction seems to be an overreaction, possibly because he was defensive or didn't want to confront his own actions.\n\nHowever, the method of confrontation might be a point of critique. Approaching a family member with such serious concerns without being clear and calm can lead to misunderstandings. The author might have approached the situation more carefully, perhaps by talking to their sister-in-law first to gauge her perspective before confronting the brother-in-law directly. But given the circumstances\u2014especially the unauthorized visit to the daughter\u2014it's understandable that the author felt compelled to act.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intentions were to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. The brother-in-law's behavior, as described, is indeed troubling, and the author's decision to address it wasn't wrong. The fallout with family relationships is unfortunate, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's safety. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
