Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend and brother-in-law has been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards his 3-year-old daughter. The examples given include nicknames like \"my Betsy,\" using \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having the daughter's picture as a screensaver and on the dashboard, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, daily FaceTime requests, and even trying to see her when the author's family was out of town. Plus, his bad hygiene is a problem.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the friend took it as an accusation of being a child molester, leading to a broken relationship and the sister-in-law cutting off contact. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior seems problematic. The line between affection and something inappropriate can be blurry, but the examples given do cross into what many would consider creepy. The fact that the author's friend agreed with the behavior being inappropriate adds weight to that. The author had a duty to protect their daughter, so confronting the brother-in-law was necessary.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been harsh. Instead of immediately calling out the behavior, maybe a calmer discussion could have been initiated first. But given the potential risk to the child, the immediate concern is safety. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and taking the accusation too far doesn't absolve the author of any wrongdoing. The author acted out of concern for their child, which is a parent's responsibility. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), as the author had valid reasons to address the situation, even if the confrontation was intense.\n"
