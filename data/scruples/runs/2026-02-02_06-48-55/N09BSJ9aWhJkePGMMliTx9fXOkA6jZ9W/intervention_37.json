Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a long-time friend and brother-in-law, known since kindergarten, and he's almost 40. His friend, now his brother-in-law, has been showing excessive focus on the author's 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy way, keeping her picture on the dashboard and phone screensaver, coming over to see her and ignoring adults, trying to FaceTime daily, and even going behind their backs to visit the daughter when they were away. Additionally, the brother-in-law's hygiene is terrible, causing bad smells on the couch and the child. The author confronted him, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now cutting off contact, and the wife is upset about losing her sister.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The brother-in-law is showing behaviors that the author and possibly others find inappropriate. The author took action by confronting him, which resulted in the relationship breakdown. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nI should consider what's considered appropriate behavior in a family setting, especially with minors. The brother-in-law's actions\u2014using affectionate nicknames, having the child's photos on screens and dashboards, trying to interact daily, and ignoring adults\u2014could be seen as overly possessive or intrusive. While it's possible that he has a genuine fondness for the child, the frequency and exclusivity might cross into inappropriate territory. The fact that he went behind their backs to visit the daughter while the author's family was away is a red flag. Parents typically have the right to control who has access to their children, so this could be a valid concern.\n\nHygiene is a separate issue, but the author mentions it as part of the problem. If the brother-in-law's behavior is making the child uncomfortable or exposing her to something (like bad smells), that's another point for the author's concern. The confrontation led to the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a molester, which is a serious accusation. However, the author was reacting to what they perceive as creepy behavior, so maybe the way they confronted him was too harsh or accusatory without sufficient evidence.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for speaking up. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Parental Rights and Child's Well-being**: Parents have the right to protect their children. If the brother-in-law's behavior is making the author and his wife uncomfortable, they have a duty to address it. The extreme actions like going behind their backs might warrant confrontation.\n\n2. **Perception vs. Reality**: The brother-in-law might not see his actions as creepy. However, the author and maybe their friend do. The line between affection and inappropriate can be subjective, especially for a 3-year-old. But actions that could be seen as overstepping, like constant contact and face-to-face interactions, might be concerning.\n\n3. **Communication Approach**: The author called him out, leading to defensiveness and a serious accusation. Maybe the approach could have been more measured, like a private conversation without confrontation. But the brother-in-law's behavior was already causing issues, and the author had to protect their family.\n\n4. **Hygiene as a Separate Issue**: While the smell is unpleasant, it's a different concern. However, if it's affecting the child, the author might have a point in bringing it up as part of the overall behavior.\n\n5. **Impact on Family Relationships**: The sister-in-law is now cutting off contact, possibly influenced by her husband's reaction. The author's wife is upset about losing her sister. This suggests that the confrontation might have been too direct or blunt, but the root issue was the brother-in-law's actions.\n\nIn many cases, when someone feels that a family member is overstepping boundaries with their child, it's reasonable to address it. The brother-in-law's behavior, even if not criminal, might be making the author and his wife uncomfortable. The author's concern is about protecting their daughter, which is a parent's responsibility. However, the way the confrontation was handled could have been improved. Accusations, even if based on concerns, can be damaging if not framed carefully. The brother-in-law's immediate defensiveness and the extreme accusation of molestation might indicate that he was already sensitive or that the author's approach was too confrontational.\n\nBut overall, the author is not in the wrong for acting in their child's best interest. The brother-in-law's actions were likely the main issue, and the author had a right to express concerns. The sister-in-law's reaction might stem from her husband taking offense, but the author's duty to protect their family is more important. So the answer is more likely B (No).\n"
