Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who they believe is showing inappropriate attention towards the author's 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the specific examples given. The brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" refers to himself as her uncle in a creepy way, has the child's picture on his dashboard and as a screensaver, comes over just to see her, ignores adults, faces her every day via FaceTime, and even tried to visit her without the parents' knowledge. Plus, his hygiene is bad, leading to smells on the child. These behaviors do seem concerning. \n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction where the brother-in-law was accused of being a child molester, which caused the sister-in-law to cut off contact. The wife is upset about possibly losing her sister.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, protecting a child is paramount. If there are signs of inappropriate behavior, it's the parent's duty to act. The author did try to distance themselves first, but when the brother-in-law went behind their backs, the confrontation was necessary. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's overreaction might be their own issues. \n\nBut legally, unless there's concrete evidence of wrongdoing, it's a judgment call. However, the author is acting in the best interest of their child. The examples, while not proof of molestation, are unsettling. The key here is the child's safety. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing behavior that they reasonably find creepy and a potential risk. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
