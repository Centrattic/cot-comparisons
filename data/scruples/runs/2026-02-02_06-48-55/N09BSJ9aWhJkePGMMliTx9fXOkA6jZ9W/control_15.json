Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's become overly focused on the writer's 3-year-old daughter. Examples given include calling her \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her picture on his dashboard and phone screensaver, frequently coming over just to see the daughter, ignoring adults, daily FaceTime requests, and even going behind the writer's back to visit the child when they left town. Also, his bad hygiene is a problem, affecting their home and daughter.\n\nThe writer confronted him, leading the brother-in-law to get defensive and accuse them of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The friend confirmed the behavior was inappropriate. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's actions are inappropriate. A 3-year-old is a young child, and adult men having such intense focus on a child can be concerning. The examples mentioned\u2014using nicknames that might be too personal, having her pictures in prominent places, ignoring adults\u2014could be seen as overstepping boundaries. Parents have a right to be concerned about such behavior, especially when it's excessive and exclusive.\n\nThe brother-in-law went behind their backs to visit the daughter while the mother-in-law was there. That's a breach of trust. The writer's reaction was to confront him, which is a reasonable step when they feel their child is being exposed to something they consider inappropriate. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the accusation of being a child molester suggests he might be in denial or unwilling to acknowledge the issue. \n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction of cutting off communication could be due to feeling her husband is being accused without proof. However, the parents' responsibility to protect their child's well-being is significant. The friend agreeing that the behavior is inappropriate supports the writer's concerns. The writer's distance was a logical response to the unsettling behavior before the confrontation.\n\nConsidering all this, the writer isn't in the wrong for protecting their daughter and addressing the behavior. The brother-in-law's actions are the problem here. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
