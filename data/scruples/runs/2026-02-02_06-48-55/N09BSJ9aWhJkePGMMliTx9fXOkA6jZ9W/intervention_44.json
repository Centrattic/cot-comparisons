Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law is acting in a way that's making the author uncomfortable. He calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses creepy terms, has pictures of her on his phone and dashboard, and even plans to visit her when the parents are away. Plus, his hygiene is bad, affecting the daughter. These are red flags for inappropriate attention towards a child.\n\nThe author and their wife have been distancing themselves, which is a reasonable first step. But when the brother-in-law goes behind their backs to see the daughter, that's a breach of trust. The author confronts him, leading to a defensive reaction from the brother-in-law and the sister-in-law cutting ties.\n\nThe key points here are the brother-in-law's actions. The author is trying to protect their daughter from someone who's displaying concerning behavior. Even if the confrontation was direct, the intent was to stop potential harm. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's anger don't negate the initial wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the friend agrees that the behavior was inappropriate, supporting the author's stance. The author isn't accusing the brother-in-law of being a molester, just calling out the creepy actions. So, the author's actions were justified to protect their child and maintain boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
