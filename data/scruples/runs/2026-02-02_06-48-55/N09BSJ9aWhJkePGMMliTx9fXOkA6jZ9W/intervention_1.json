Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has been acting inappropriately towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him about his behavior, which led to a fallout with both the brother-in-law and the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother-in-law has shown excessive attention towards the young child, using affectionate nicknames, having her photo on his dashboard and phone, visiting just to see her and ignoring others, FaceTiming daily, and even planning to see her while the parents were away. Additionally, his poor hygiene caused issues. The author and his wife distanced themselves and then confronted him, leading the brother-in-law to accuse them of accusing him of being a child molester, and the sister-in-law cutting off communication.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: he addressed the concerning behavior directly. The question is whether he was wrong to do so. The main issue here is the brother-in-law's actions towards a child. Even if the brother-in-law didn't have malicious intent, the behavior could still be inappropriate. The author had a duty to protect his daughter, especially since the other parent (sister-in-law) might not share the same concern. The author's confrontation was a response to protect his family, even if it caused a rift. \n\nThe brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's anger might be due to feeling accused or misunderstood, but the author's priority was the child's safety. In such cases, it's important to act in the child's best interest, even if it strains relationships. The friend agreeing that the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's perspective. So, the author isn't in the wrong for speaking up about what he reasonably perceived as inappropriate behavior towards his daughter.\n"
