Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. The situation involves the brother-in-law showing excessive attention to the child, which the author and their wife find creepy. The brother-in-law then makes plans to see the daughter without their knowledge, leading to the confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions. The examples given\u2014calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy tone, having her photo on his dashboard and phone wallpaper, frequent attempts to see her, ignoring adults, and even planning to visit without the parents' knowledge\u2014do seem concerning. Especially since the child is very young, such behavior could be inappropriate, even if not explicitly illegal. The hygiene issue adds to the discomfort, as it's unsanitary and potentially harmful.\n\nThe author then confronted him, which led to the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a child molester, causing a rift in the family. The key question is whether the author was correct to confront him or if they overstepped.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, parents have the right to ensure their child's safety and well-being. If there are signs of inappropriate attention, even if not criminal, it's reasonable to address it. The brother-in-law's actions cross boundaries by involving the child without the parents' knowledge and consent. The author's reaction is a protective measure.\n\nHowever, the confrontation might have been harsh if it came across as an accusation without evidence. The brother-in-law's defensiveness suggests he might not see his actions as wrong. The author's friend also agreed the behavior wasn't appropriate, which adds credibility to their concerns.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their child. They had valid reasons to be concerned and acted to safeguard their daughter's well-being. The brother-in-law's behavior was inappropriate, and the author's response, while causing a conflict, was justified.\n"
