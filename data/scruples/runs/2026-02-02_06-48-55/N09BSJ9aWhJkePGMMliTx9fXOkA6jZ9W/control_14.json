Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's showing what the author considers inappropriate attention towards his 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls her \"my Betsy,\" has her photo on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see her, ignores adults, FaceTimes every day, and even tried to see her when the author and wife were out of town. Plus, his hygiene is bad, which is affecting their daughter.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law got defensive, accusing him of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset and not talking to them. The wife is caught in the middle between her sister and the author.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did the right thing by confronting. The brother-in-law's behavior seems concerning. At 3 years old, a child doesn't understand boundaries, so any adult showing excessive attention could be problematic. The author's actions were to protect his daughter and set boundaries. However, the way he approached it might have been abrupt, leading to the brother-in-law feeling accused. But given the examples, the behavior does seem creepy, especially the behind-the-back plan with MIL. \n\nThe key points are the inappropriate focus on a young child and the violation of trust by arranging to see her without permission. The author's reaction is protective. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's anger might be due to feeling betrayed. However, the author's actions were in the best interest of his daughter's safety and hygiene. \n\nIs the author wrong? The brother-in-law's actions are concerning, so the author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. He had a duty to protect his daughter. The answer should be B, No.\n"
