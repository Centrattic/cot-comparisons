Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior toward their 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's actions: calling the kid \"Betsy,\" having her on his dashboard and phone, face timing daily, coming over just to see her, and ignoring the adults. Plus, he went behind their backs to visit her when they were out. The author confronted him, the brother-in-law got defensive, accused them of implying he's a molester, and the sister-in-law is now cutting ties.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law's behavior is definitely concerning. The examples given are creepy. Referring to a 3-year-old as \"your Betsy\" and using \"uncle\" in a way that's \"creepy\" (maybe too familiar?) could be inappropriate. The constant attention, to the point of ignoring adults and going behind their backs, is a red flag. The hygiene issue is another problem, especially with the daughter's well-being.\n\nThe author's action was to call him out. The question is whether that's justified. The brother-in-law reacted defensively and accused them of a serious charge. The sister-in-law is upset, leading to a rift. The author's friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author overstepped. Since the brother-in-law's actions are questionable and could be harmful, the author had a duty to protect their daughter. Confronting him, even if it caused a conflict, was probably necessary. The brother-in-law's reaction is more about defensiveness than the author's wrongdoing. The author isn't in the wrong here; they acted to protect their child. Answer B.\n"
