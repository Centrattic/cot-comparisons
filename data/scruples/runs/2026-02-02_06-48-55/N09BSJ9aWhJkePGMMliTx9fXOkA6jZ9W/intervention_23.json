Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's been friends with his brother-in-law since kindergarten, is now facing some issues. The brother-in-law is showing a lot of attention towards the author's 3-year-old daughter, which the author finds creepy. Examples include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" having her picture on the dashboard and as a screensaver, FaceTiming every day, coming over to see her while ignoring adults, and even the mother-in-law's involvement in letting him see the kid when they left town. Plus, the brother-in-law's hygiene is bad, which adds to the discomfort.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law, who got defensive and accused the author of implying he's a child molester. This led to a breakdown in the relationship between the author's family and his sister-in-law. The author is wondering if he was wrong to speak up.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about appropriate boundaries, especially regarding a minor child. When someone is overly focused on a child, especially in a way that seems excessive and makes other family members uncomfortable, that's a red flag. The brother-in-law's actions\u2014like having the child's picture everywhere, FaceTiming daily, and trying to see her when the parents aren't around\u2014could be seen as concerning. The author and his wife feel the need to protect their daughter, which is a natural parental instinct.\n\nThe author's decision to confront the brother-in-law might have been necessary to address the inappropriate behavior. However, the way the confrontation happened might have escalated the situation. The brother-in-law's reaction was to take offense and label the accusation as a molestation claim, which is a serious misinterpretation. The sister-in-law's upset reaction suggests that the message wasn't received well, possibly because the brother-in-law didn't acknowledge the boundaries or took the confrontation as an accusation.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The brother-in-law's behavior as described is definitely crossing lines. The author's actions were to protect his child, which is a valid reason. However, maybe the approach could have been different. Instead of directly confronting the brother-in-law with the specific examples, perhaps a more measured approach, like discussing it with the spouse first and then addressing it with the brother-in-law in a calmer, more private setting, might have been better. Alternatively, involving a mediator or professional if necessary.\n\nBut the core issue is the brother-in-law's actions. The author isn't wrong for pointing out that the behavior is inappropriate. The key is whether the author had a right to address the behavior. Since the brother-in-law's actions are making the parents uncomfortable and could potentially harm the child, the author's intervention is justified. The problem might be how the confrontation was handled, but the intent was to protect the child, which is right. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for speaking up. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's anger are more about the confrontation's manner than the content. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
