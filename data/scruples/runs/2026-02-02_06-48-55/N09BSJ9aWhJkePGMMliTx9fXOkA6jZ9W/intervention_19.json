Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been showing what the family perceives as inappropriate behavior towards the author's 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The brother-in-law refers to the daughter with terms like \"my Betsy,\" uses the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has the child's picture as his screensaver and dashboard, visits just to see the kid and ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even planned to visit when the parents were away. Plus, he has bad hygiene that's affecting the daughter. The author confronted him, and the brother-in-law took offense, thinking it was an accusation of being a child molester, leading to the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother-in-law's behavior towards a young child. The author felt it was inappropriate and decided to confront him. The main question is whether the author was wrong to do so. \n\nFrom a general standpoint, any behavior that makes others uncomfortable, especially involving a minor, is typically considered concerning. The brother-in-law's actions\u2014excessive attention, keeping photos of the child in personal spaces, trying to see her without the parents' presence, and ignoring adults\u2014can be seen as overstepping boundaries. The author's intervention seems to be a protective measure for their daughter. However, the way the author communicated it might have been abrupt, leading to the brother-in-law's defensive reaction. But given the potential risk to the child, the author's actions might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have approached it more carefully, perhaps by discussing it with their wife first or involving other family members. But the situation involves a child's well-being, which is a high priority. Parents have a duty to protect their children from any behavior that could be harmful or inappropriate. The brother-in-law's reaction might indicate he was aware his behavior was crossing lines but didn't see it that way. The author's confrontation could have been necessary to stop further issues.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is likely in the right because protecting their child is paramount. However, handling it in a way that causes a family rift might be a consequence they have to live with, but the action itself was justified. The brother-in-law's behavior was questionable, and the author's response, while leading to conflict, was an attempt to address a serious concern.\n"
