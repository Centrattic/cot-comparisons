Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's becoming overly focused on the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The writer confronts him, leading to a broken relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the behavior of the brother-in-law. He's calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using creepiness in his uncle title, having pictures of her on his dashboard and phone, coming over to see her while ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even going behind their backs to visit when the parents are away. Plus, the bad hygiene issue. All of this seems concerning. The writer's main point is that the focus is inappropriate and they took action to protect their daughter.\n\nThe brother-in-law reacted defensively, accusing the writer of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The writer is now questioning if they were right to confront the brother-in-law.\n\nNow, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants an opinion. I need to evaluate if confronting the brother-in-law was justified. Considering the behavior described, it does seem like there's a potential for inappropriate attention towards a minor child. The key here is whether the writer's actions were a reasonable response to possible child endangerment or inappropriate behavior.\n\nIn many cases, when someone is overly fixated on a child, especially in a way that's intrusive or exclusive, it's a red flag. The brother-in-law's actions\u2014going behind the parents' backs to see the child, daily contact, and ignoring adults\u2014could be signs of grooming. The writer's decision to address it directly is a protective measure for their daughter. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's upset reaction might be because they perceive the accusation as harsh, but the writer's intent was to protect their child.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but that might be underestimating the seriousness of the brother-in-law's behavior. The author acted to prevent potential harm, which is a parent's duty. Therefore, the correct answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
