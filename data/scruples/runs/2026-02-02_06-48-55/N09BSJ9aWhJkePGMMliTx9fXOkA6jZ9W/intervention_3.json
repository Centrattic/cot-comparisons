Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards his 3-year-old daughter. Examples given include the brother-in-law referring to the kid as \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and phone, making plans to see the child when the parents are away, and bad hygiene that affects the kid.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law, leading to a breakdown in the relationship with his wife's sister. The brother-in-law took offense, accusing the author of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of the brother-in-law. The behaviors described do seem concerning. A 3-year-old is very young, and the brother-in-law's focus on her, especially with the examples given, could be seen as inappropriate. The key here is whether these actions cross a line into being creepy or potentially harmful. The author's reaction is based on protecting their daughter and ensuring her safety. \n\nHowever, the author could have approached the situation differently. Instead of directly confronting the brother-in-law in a way that led to immediate defensiveness and accusations, maybe a more private and careful conversation could have been had. The author did mention confiding in a friend, who agreed it was inappropriate, so they aren't acting entirely out of nowhere. The fact that the brother-in-law made plans behind their backs to see the child when the parents were away is a red flag. That action alone justifies the author's concern and intervention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's method of confronting might have been confrontational or accusatory, which could have exacerbated the situation. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction might have been heightened if the approach wasn't measured. Still, the underlying issue is the brother-in-law's behavior, which is the root problem here. The author's intent was to protect their daughter, which is a valid and responsible action. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate, then the author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. The author had a duty to ensure their daughter's safety and well-being. The brother-in-law's defensive response doesn't absolve him of any wrongdoing. The author's actions were in response to the brother-in-law's behavior, so the blame lies more on the brother-in-law for his actions rather than the author for pointing them out. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author had a valid concern and acted to protect their family, even if the confrontation could have been handled more carefully.\n"
