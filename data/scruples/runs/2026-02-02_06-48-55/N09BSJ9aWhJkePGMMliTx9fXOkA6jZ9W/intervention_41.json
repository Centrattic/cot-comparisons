Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault. The writer is a long-time friend and brother-in-law of the author's wife. The key issue is that the brother-in-law has an infatuation with the author's 3-year-old daughter. Examples include using affectionate terms like \"my Betsy,\" setting up a photo of the daughter as his screensaver, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. The author discovered that the brother-in-law made plans with the mother-in-law to see the daughter while they were away. The author confronted him, leading to conflict and the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a child molester.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's behavior crosses into inappropriate territory. The examples given do seem concerning. Referring to a young child as \"my Betsy,\" using a screensaver of her, and coming over just to see her could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a 3-year-old. The author's concern about the smell and the brother-in-law's hygiene is an added issue but not the main ethical problem here.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law, which led to a defensive reaction and the sister-in-law cutting off communication. The author's friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate. The key question is whether the author overreacted or had a valid reason to speak up. \n\nThe main ethical considerations are: 1) The appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions towards the daughter, and 2) The author's right to address this concern directly. Given that the brother-in-law's actions seem to focus intensely on a young child in a way that's not typical for a relative, the author's intervention might be justified. However, the confrontational approach could have been handled more sensitively to prevent the relationship from breaking down.\n\nBut in terms of fault, the primary issue is the brother-in-law's behavior. The author's actions in confronting him, while perhaps harsh, were based on valid concerns for their daughter's safety and well-being. The brother-in-law's reaction of calling it an accusation of molestation is extreme and possibly dismissive of the real concerns. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for addressing the inappropriate behavior. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
