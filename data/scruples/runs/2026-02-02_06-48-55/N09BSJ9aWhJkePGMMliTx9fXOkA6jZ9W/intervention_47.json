Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The author is a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that's making the family uncomfortable, especially regarding his focus on the author's daughter. The key points are the behavior towards the daughter, going behind their backs, and the resulting fallout.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law refers to the daughter as \"my Betsy,\" uses the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has her picture on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see her, ignores adults, and even plans to visit when the parents are away. Plus, his poor hygiene is a problem. The author confronts him, leading to a defensive reaction where the brother-in-law accuses the author of accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. The brother-in-law's actions seem concerning. Referring to a 3-year-old as \"my Betsy\" and having her as a screensaver could be seen as over-attachment. Coming over just to see her and ignoring others is odd. Planning to visit when the parents are gone is definitely crossing a boundary. The hygiene issue adds to the discomfort.\n\nThe author's response was to confront him directly. Is this justified? The brother-in-law took it as an accusation of child molestation, which is a severe accusation. But given the behavior, the author might have felt it's necessary to address it. The question is whether the author overstepped. \n\nLegally, unless there's evidence of actual abuse, it's hard to say. But in terms of social boundaries, the brother-in-law's behavior is definitely inappropriate. The author had a right to be concerned about their daughter's safety and well-being. Confronting him directly might have been a necessary step to protect the daughter and set boundaries. However, the way it was done might have caused the sister-in-law to take it personally, thinking it's an accusation against her husband. The author might have approached it more tactfully, but the core issue is the brother-in-law's behavior, not the author's reaction.\n\nSo, considering all that, the brother-in-law's actions are problematic. The author's actions were a response to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
