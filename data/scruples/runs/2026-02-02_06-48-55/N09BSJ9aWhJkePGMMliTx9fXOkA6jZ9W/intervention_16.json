Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother-in-law who's been acting inappropriately towards the author's daughter. The brother-in-law calls her \"my Betsy,\" has her as his phone wallpaper, comes over just to see her, and even tried to visit without the author's knowledge. The author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a child molester, which caused a rift with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning. The examples given\u2014like the phone screensaver, referring to himself in a way that's \"creepy,\" and trying to see the daughter without permission\u2014are all red flags. The hygiene issue might also contribute to the author's discomfort. The key point here is whether the author overstepped by confronting the brother-in-law.\n\nThe author's main concern is the safety and well-being of their daughter. It's reasonable to want to protect a child from someone whose behavior is questionable. The author didn't just keep quiet; they took action because they felt the brother-in-law's actions were inappropriate. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's upset reaction might be due to feeling blindsided or accused without evidence.\n\nHowever, the author didn't accuse the brother-in-law of being a molester directly. They pointed out the behavior as creepy and behind-the-back actions. The brother-in-law might have interpreted this as an accusation, but the author's intent was to address the behavior. The author also mentioned talking to a mutual friend who agreed it was inappropriate, which suggests they had some external validation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the brother-in-law's actions are the primary issue. The author had a duty to protect their daughter, even if it caused tension. The question is whether the confrontation was necessary. Given the behaviors described, it seems justified. The author might have handled it differently, perhaps by first talking to their sister-in-law more carefully, but the core issue is the brother-in-law's actions, not the author's response.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). They had valid concerns and acted to protect their child. The brother-in-law's reaction might be overblown, but the author's actions were in response to real issues.\n"
