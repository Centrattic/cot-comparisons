Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's become overly focused on his sister-in-law's 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a broken relationship and his wife's sister being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The brother-in-law's behavior includes calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy tone when referring to himself as \"uncle,\" having the child's photo on his dashboard and phone, visiting just to see her, ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even planning to see the child behind the parents' backs. Plus, his bad hygiene caused issues. The author confronted him, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being accused of child molestation.\n\nThe author's actions: they called out the brother-in-law for his behavior, which the sister found offensive, causing the sister to cut ties. The user is wondering if the author is at fault.\n\nIn terms of appropriateness, the brother-in-law's actions do seem concerning. While it's possible he's just being a doting relative, the frequency and exclusivity of his attention to a 3-year-old, along with the secretive behavior, could be problematic. Parents have a right to protect their children and set boundaries regarding who interacts with them. The author's concern about the child's safety and well-being is valid. Confronting someone about behavior that could be perceived as inappropriate, especially when it's affecting their child, is a parent's responsibility.\n\nHowever, the manner of confrontation might be a factor. The brother-in-law felt accused of being a child molester, which is a serious accusation. The author might not have approached the situation delicately enough, leading to the defensive reaction. But given the behavior described, it's understandable that the author felt compelled to act to protect their daughter.\n\nConsidering all that, the brother-in-law's actions were likely inappropriate, and the author had a right to address it. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the behavior was concerning, and the author acted to protect their child.\n"
