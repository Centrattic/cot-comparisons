Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has been acting inappropriately towards the writer's young daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's obsessive behavior, the writer confronting him, and the resulting fallout in family relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the brother-in-law's actions. Referring to a 3-year-old as \"my Betsy,\" having her picture on the dashboard and screensaver, making daily FaceTime calls, and coming over just to see her while ignoring adults all seem concerning. The hygiene issue where he left a bad smell on the couch and the child is another red flag. The brother-in-law also went behind the family's back to arrange a visit with the daughter while the parents were away, which shows a lack of respect for boundaries.\n\nThe writer confronted the brother-in-law about these behaviors, which led to the brother-in-law being defensive and accusing the writer of falsely accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law was upset and cut off communication, causing family conflict. The wife is distressed about losing her sister.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author might be in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The writer's actions were in response to what they perceived as inappropriate behavior towards their daughter. Protecting a child's well-being is a primary concern. The writer did not act without cause; they had evidence of the brother-in-law's actions and even got confirmation from a mutual friend. Confronting someone about behavior that could harm a child is generally justified. However, the manner of confrontation might be a factor. Did the writer approach the situation calmly and with evidence, or was there an outburst? The post mentions calling him out for the creepy behavior, which led to defensiveness. The brother-in-law's reaction of being accused of a serious crime (child molestation) might be an overreaction, but the writer's intent was to address actual behavior, not make a false accusation.\n\nThe key here is intent and proportionality. The writer's intent was to protect their daughter from someone's obsessive and potentially harmful behavior. The brother-in-law's actions were inappropriate, and the writer had a duty to address it. The fallout in the relationship is unfortunate, but the writer isn't in the wrong for standing up for their child's safety and well-being. The sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling attacked or not understanding the severity of the brother's actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The writer acted in the best interest of their daughter and addressed inappropriate behavior, which is a valid and responsible action.\n"
