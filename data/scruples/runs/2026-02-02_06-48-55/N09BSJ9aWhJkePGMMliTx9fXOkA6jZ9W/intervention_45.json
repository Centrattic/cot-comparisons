Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's developing an infatuation with the author's 3-year-old daughter. The author confronted him, leading to a ruined relationship with his sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother-in-law is acting in a way that could be considered inappropriate. He calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has her picture on his dashboard and phone, visits just to see her, ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even went behind their backs to see her when they were away. Plus, he has bad hygiene that affects the child. The author confronts him, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is sad about losing her sister.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know my opinion. Hmm. The author's actions were to address inappropriate behavior towards his daughter. As a parent, protecting a child is a priority. The brother-in-law's actions do seem concerning. The author had reason to be alarmed, especially with the behind-the-back plans. Confronting someone about behavior that could be harmful is understandable. The brother-in-law's reaction was extreme, but the author's intent was to protect the child. The user might be thinking the author overreacted, but given the circumstances, it's a parent's duty to act. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
