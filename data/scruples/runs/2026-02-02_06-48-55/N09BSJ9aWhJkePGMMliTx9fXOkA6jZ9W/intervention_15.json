Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards his 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses the phone screen to show her picture, has her photo on his dashboard, insists on being called \"uncle,\" and even tries to come over just to see her, ignoring adults. Plus, he made plans with the mother-in-law to visit the daughter when the author and wife were out. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and accusations of being a child molester. The brother-in-law's sister (the wife) is upset and might lose contact with her sister.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the brother-in-law's behavior. The actions described\u2014referring to the child in possessive terms, having her image on personal items, coming over to see her while ignoring others, and trying to see her when the parents aren't home\u2014could be seen as concerning. The author is a parent, so protecting their child is a priority. The brother-in-law's hygiene issues adding to the problem, like making the couch smell, might be a red flag too.\n\nThe author's approach was to confront the brother-in-law. The key question is whether this confrontation was justified. The author felt the need to act because of the potential risk to their daughter. However, the brother-in-law felt accused of being a molester, which is a serious accusation. The author might have overstepped by making such an accusation, even if it was implied. Confronting someone with such strong language can lead to defensiveness and relationship breakdown.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, they have a responsibility to protect their child. The brother-in-law's behavior is indeed unusual, and the author's actions were to address what they saw as a threat. However, the way the confrontation happened might have been too harsh. Maybe they should have approached it more carefully, perhaps first talking to the wife (his sister) to see if she noticed the same things before confronting the brother-in-law directly.\n\nThe brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction suggest that the author's approach might have been too confrontational. Instead of immediately calling him out, maybe there's a more constructive way to address the issue without alienating the family. The author's intent was to protect their daughter, which is valid, but the method might have contributed to the fallout.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They acted out of concern for their child, which is understandable. However, the way they handled it may have been too direct or accusatory. The brother-in-law's reaction might be due to the author's approach rather than the underlying issue. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for how the confrontation was handled, even if the initial concern was justified.\n"
