Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for confronting their long-time friend and brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. The friend has been acting in ways that seem inappropriate, like calling the child \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy tone, having the child's photo as a screensaver and on his dashboard, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, FaceTiming daily, and even trying to visit her unsupervised while the parents were away. Plus, his hygiene is terrible, which is a concern for the child's health.\n\nThe key points here are the inappropriate behavior and the parents' right to protect their child. The author felt uncomfortable and took action when they discovered the friend was going behind their backs to see the daughter. The friend's reaction was defensive, and the sister-in-law is now cutting off contact. The author's friend also agreed the behavior was not appropriate.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, parents have a responsibility to ensure their children's safety and well-being. If there are signs of someone being overly fixated or acting in a way that could be concerning, especially with a young child, it's reasonable for the parents to address it. The behavior described\u2014like constant attention, ignoring adults, and unsupervised visits\u2014could be seen as red flags. The author's action of confronting the friend was likely an attempt to protect their daughter, which is understandable. \n\nHowever, the approach taken might be a point of discussion. The author called the friend out, leading to the friend feeling accused of being a child molester, which is a serious accusation. That might have escalated the situation and caused a rift. But given the context, the author might not have felt they had a choice, especially since the friend was going behind their backs. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for protecting their child. The brother-in-law's actions are the main issue here, and the author's response was a reaction to those actions. The sister-in-law's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's primary responsibility is to their family's safety. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
