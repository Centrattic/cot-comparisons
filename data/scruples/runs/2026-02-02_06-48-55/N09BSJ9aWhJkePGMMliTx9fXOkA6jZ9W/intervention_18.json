Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards his 3-year-old daughter. The key points are that the brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses his phone's screensaver with her picture, has her on his dashboard, comes over to see her and ignores adults, FaceTimes daily, and even went behind their backs to visit during a trip. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship with the sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the behavior of the brother-in-law. The actions described\u2014referring to the child with endearing terms, keeping her image on personal devices, excessive attention, and ignoring other family members\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. The author's concern is valid because any behavior that could be misinterpreted as inappropriate, especially involving a minor, is a red flag. The brother-in-law's hygiene is also a point, but that's more about personal habits, though it affects others.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law, which led to defensiveness and accusations of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nNow, considering the appropriateness of the author's actions. The brother-in-law's behavior could be harmful, even if not illegal. The author had a duty to protect their daughter and address the situation. Confronting him directly might have been a necessary step to stop the behavior. However, the approach might have been heavy-handed. Maybe a more measured approach, like discussing with the sister-in-law first or involving other family members, could have been better. But given the potential risks, the author's actions were protective.\n\nThe brother-in-law's reaction was extreme, possibly deflecting blame. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their child. The key is whether the brother-in-law's actions were actually inappropriate. If so, the author had to act. The answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because the author was protecting their daughter from potentially inappropriate behavior.\n"
