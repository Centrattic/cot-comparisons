Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's become overly focused on the author's three-year-old daughter. The examples given are things like calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her while ignoring adults, and even trying to FaceTime her every day. There's also mention of bad hygiene leading to smells on the furniture and the child.\n\nThe author confronts the brother-in-law, who then accuses them of falsely accusing him of child molestation, leading to a strained relationship. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is caught in the middle.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's behavior. While some might say it's overstepping to have such close attention on a child, especially with photos and daily contact, it's important to consider cultural or familial norms. However, the key points here are the behavior being \"creepy,\" the behind-the-scenes actions (trying to see the daughter when the parents aren't home), and the hygiene issue causing discomfort. These could be signs of inappropriate attachment, especially when it's excessive and one-sided.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law. The question is whether this confrontation was justified. The author's actions were based on their perception of the behavior being creepy and a potential risk to their daughter. They had reason to be concerned, especially after the brother-in-law went behind their backs. Confronting someone about behavior that causes concern for a child's well-being is generally a responsible action. However, the way it was done might matter. Did they approach it respectfully, or was it an accusation without evidence? The brother-in-law reacted defensively and even more so by being accused of something as severe as child molestation, which could have been a misstep from the author. But the author did mention they confided in a friend first, who agreed it was inappropriate, so there was some validation.\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction is also a factor. If she was supportive of her husband's actions, the author had to take a stand to protect their daughter. The hygiene issue is a separate concern but adds to the overall discomfort. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their daughter's safety and their family's well-being. However, they might have handled the confrontation differently to avoid such a drastic fallout, but the core issue of the inappropriate behavior seems valid.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's concerns were legitimate, and taking action to address them isn't necessarily in the wrong. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
