Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the brother-in-law has been acting in a way that the author and his wife find creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" using a creepily familiar term like \"uncle,\" having her picture on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, daily FaceTime requests, and even planning to visit the daughter when they were out of town. Plus, there's the issue of his bad hygiene affecting the child.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a defensive response where the brother-in-law accused them of accusing him of being a child molester. This caused the sister-in-law to cut off communication, and the wife is upset about losing her sister.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to consider both sides. The author's actions were based on concern for their daughter's well-being. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem inappropriate. The author felt it necessary to confront him after trying to distance themselves first. However, the confrontation might have been handled better. Maybe there were other steps they could have taken before directly confronting him, like involving the sister-in-law first or getting more evidence. But given the potential risk to the child, it's hard to say they're entirely at fault. The brother-in-law's reaction was extreme, but the author's actions were protective. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The key is that the behavior was concerning, and they acted to protect their daughter. The answer is B.\n"
