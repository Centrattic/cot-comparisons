Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards his 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law refers to the child by a pet name, has her picture as a screensaver, comes over just to see her, and even tried to visit without the parents' knowledge. The author confronts him, leading to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother-in-law's actions: calling the child \"my Betsy,\" which is a term that might be too affectionate for a niece. He's making her the screensaver, having a picture on his dashboard, FaceTiming daily, and coming over just to see her. The author mentions this creeps them out. Then there's the incident where he goes behind their backs to visit the child when they're away. The hygiene issue adds to the discomfort, but the main issue is the inappropriate focus on the child.\n\nThe author confronted the brother-in-law, who then accused them of accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The author's friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the brother-in-law's behavior crosses boundaries. A 3-year-old's uncle shouldn't have that level of attention, especially without the parents' consent. The author has a duty to protect their child, so confronting them is understandable. The brother-in-law's reaction seems defensive and possibly projecting. The sister-in-law might be defensive of her husband, leading to the fallout.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. The actions described could be seen as protective. However, maybe the author should have addressed it more privately first. But given the repeated behavior and the attempt to visit without permission, confronting him wasn't unreasonable. The brother-in-law's response was extreme, which complicates things. The author isn't wrong for standing up for their child's well-being. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
