Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's become overly focused on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law's actions include things like calling her \"my Betsy,\" using her as a phone screensaver, and trying to visit her without the author and his wife's knowledge. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the brother-in-law's behavior is inappropriate. The examples given\u2014referring to the child in a possessive way, keeping her image on his dashboard and phone, trying to see her daily, and ignoring adults\u2014could be seen as concerning. The fact that the sister-in-law is now upset and the brother-in-law accused of being a child molester adds weight to the author's perspective. However, the author's action was to confront the brother-in-law directly, which led to the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: They felt the need to address the behavior they found creepy, especially after discovering the brother-in-law made plans without their knowledge. Confronting someone about behavior that makes you uncomfortable is generally justified, especially when it involves a child. However, the author might have been too direct without giving the brother-in-law a chance to explain. But given the examples, the brother-in-law's actions do cross boundaries. The author's defense of their daughter and their family is a parent's responsibility.\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction is also a factor. If the brother-in-law is indeed acting inappropriately, the author is within their rights to protect their family. The key here is whether the author overstepped by calling out the brother-in-law. Since the behavior was potentially harmful and the author had reason to believe it was inappropriate, they are not in the wrong for addressing it. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
