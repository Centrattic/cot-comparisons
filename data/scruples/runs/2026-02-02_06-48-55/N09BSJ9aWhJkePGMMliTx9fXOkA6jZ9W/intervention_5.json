Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has become overly focused on the author's three-year-old daughter. The key points are the man's behavior: calling her \"my Betsy,\" setting her as his phone screensaver, having her photo on his dashboard, coming over to see her and ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even trying to visit when the author and wife were out. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship with the brother-in-law and sister-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions. The man is married to the author's sister-in-law, so he's in a position where his behavior towards a family member's child is under scrutiny. The examples given could be seen as crossing boundaries. For instance, referring to the child in a possessive way (\"my Betsy\"), having her photo on personal devices, and visiting specifically to see her while ignoring others might indicate he's overstepping. The fact that he went behind their backs to see the daughter when they were away raises concerns about consent and trust.\n\nThe author's reaction was to confront him, which led to the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a child molester. This defensive reaction might suggest that the confrontation was too harsh or accusatory, but given the behavior described, the author might have felt justified in standing up for their daughter's safety and boundaries. The sister-in-law's reaction is also influenced here\u2014if the brother-in-law is defensive and denies any wrongdoing, the sister-in-law might take sides, leading to the rift.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were in response to what they perceived as inappropriate behavior towards their daughter. Parents have a responsibility to protect their children from any potentially harmful or uncomfortable situations. Even if the brother-in-law isn't a molester, the behavior described can be unsettling and might be harmful in other ways, like making the child feel objectified or pressuring the parents. The author's approach was to address the issue directly, which is understandable when it comes to a parent's concern for their child's well-being.\n\nHowever, the confrontation might have been handled differently. Instead of immediately confronting the brother-in-law, maybe the author could have given him a chance to self-reflect or discussed it privately without making strong accusations. But given the situation where the brother-in-law was going behind their backs, the author might have felt the need for a direct approach.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but based on the analysis, the author's actions seem to be a justified response to protect their daughter. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
