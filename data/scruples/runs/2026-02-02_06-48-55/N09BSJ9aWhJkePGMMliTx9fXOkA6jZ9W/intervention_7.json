Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (and his wife) have a brother-in-law who they feel is being inappropriate with their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law is acting in a way that seems obsessive, like having the daughter's picture on his dashboard and screensaver, trying to FaceTime her every day, and even making plans with the mother-in-law to see the child when the author's family wasn't home. The author confronts him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's appropriate behavior. The brother-in-law is the daughter's uncle, so there's a family connection. However, the behavior described\u2014referring to the child affectionately in a way that feels strange, excessive attention, and acting in a way that's more focused on the child than others\u2014could be concerning. The key points are the author's perception of the behavior as creepy, the brother-in-law's actions going behind their back, and the hygiene issue that affects their daughter. \n\nThe author's actions were to confront the brother-in-law about this. The brother-in-law took offense, feeling accused of being a child molester, and the sister-in-law cut off communication. The wife is upset about losing her sister over this. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the behavior is actually inappropriate, then the author is justified in speaking up. However, if the author overreacted without sufficient evidence, that could be an issue. But given that the brother-in-law was trying to see the child without the parents' knowledge and had a pattern of behavior that others (including the author's longtime friend) agreed was not appropriate, it seems like the author had valid concerns.\n\nThe brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's response might be due to feeling accused without proof, but the author had legitimate reasons to be concerned about their daughter's safety and well-being. Parents have a right to protect their children from what they perceive as inappropriate attention, even if it's from family.\n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author's actions seem justified. The brother-in-law's behavior crosses boundaries, and confronting him was necessary to protect the child. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
