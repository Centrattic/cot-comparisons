Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's developed an inappropriate focus on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior: calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and as a screensaver, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, daily FaceTime requests, and even planning to visit when the parents were away. Plus, his bad hygiene caused issues. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning. Referring to a young child in a possessive way, excessive attention, and trying to see her without the parents' knowledge could indicate inappropriate intentions. The author and his wife had a right to be protective of their daughter. Confronting someone about behavior that could be harmful is generally acceptable, especially when it involves a child.\n\nThe brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's anger might be due to feeling accused without proof. However, the author didn't accuse him of being a molester; they called out the creepy behavior. The sister-in-law's reaction could be overprotective or defensive of her husband. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern, as it affects the child's environment.\n\nThe author's friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate, which supports the author's perspective. The main question is whether confronting the brother-in-law was the right move. Since the behavior was potentially harmful to the child, the author had a duty to address it. The brother-in-law's reaction might have been defensive, but the author wasn't in the wrong for protecting their daughter. The answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
