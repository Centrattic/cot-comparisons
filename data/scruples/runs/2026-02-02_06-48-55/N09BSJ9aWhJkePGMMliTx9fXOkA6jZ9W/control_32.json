Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person has a long-time friend who is also their brother-in-law. This friend has married their wife's sister. Over the past year, he's developed an infatuation with the author's daughter, who's 3 years old. The examples given are that he calls her \"my Betsy,\" refers to himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has a picture of her on his dashboard and phone screensaver, comes over just to see her, ignores the adults, tries to FaceTime her every day, and even went behind their backs to visit her when they were out of town.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law got defensive and accused them of accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife might lose her sister over this. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the brother-in-law's behavior is actually inappropriate. The actions described\u2014like having the child's photo on the dashboard and screensaver, FaceTiming her daily, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults\u2014could be seen as overstepping. Especially since the author's daughter is only 3, which is very young. The behavior might be crossing into creepy territory, especially if it's causing the author discomfort.\n\nThen there's the part where the brother-in-law went behind their backs to visit the daughter when they were away. That seems like a breach of trust. The author has the right to be concerned about their child's safety and well-being, so confronting him might be necessary.\n\nHowever, the way the author handled it could be a factor. They mention calling him out for the behavior. Depending on the tone and approach, confrontation can sometimes escalate things. But given the examples, the behavior is concerning, so the author's concern is valid. The brother-in-law's reaction of being defensive and accusing them of implying he's a child molester might be an overreaction, but it shows he felt accused of something serious. \n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction and the potential fallout in the family relationships is a big issue. The author's wife is upset about possibly losing her sister. However, the author's responsibility to protect their daughter might take precedence. The friend they confided in also agreed the behavior was inappropriate, which supports the author's perspective.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, if someone is showing excessive interest in a minor child, especially in a way that's making the parents uncomfortable, it's generally considered inappropriate. The hygiene issue is an added problem, but the main concern is the focus on the daughter. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing this, especially after trying to distance themselves first. The brother-in-law's actions are the root issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
