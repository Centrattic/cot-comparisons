Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law is acting in a way that seems inappropriate. He's calling the 3-year-old \"my Betsy,\" using her as his screensaver, having a photo on his dashboard, coming over just to see her and ignoring others, FaceTiming daily, and even trying to visit her behind the family's back. Plus, his bad hygiene is affecting the daughter. These actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially with a young child.\n\nThe author and their wife have been distancing themselves. Then they find out he planned to visit their daughter without their knowledge. The author confronts him, leading to a defensive reaction where the brother-in-law accuses them of accusing him of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the relationship is ruined.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to consider whether confronting the brother-in-law was justified. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior crossing lines, potential harm to the child, and the family dynamics. \n\nThe brother-in-law's actions might not be legally wrong, but they are certainly inappropriate and creepy. The author had a duty to protect their daughter and address the behavior. The confrontation might have been necessary to prevent further issues. However, the way the author handled it might have been harsh, but given the situation, it's understandable. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister's reaction complicate things, but the author's intent was to protect their child. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their family's safety. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
