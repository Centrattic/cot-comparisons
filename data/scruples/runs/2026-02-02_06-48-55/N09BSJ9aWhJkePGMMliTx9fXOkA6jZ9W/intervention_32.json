Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author, who's known his friend/brother-in-law since kindergarten, feels his friend has been too focused on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The friend calls her \"my Betsy,\" uses her as his screensaver, has her picture on his dashboard, comes over just to see her, and even tried to visit when the author and wife were out of town, going behind their backs. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction where the friend accused him of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister.\n\nHmm, first, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the friend's behavior towards the daughter. The friend seems to have an inappropriate focus on a young child. The behaviors described\u2014using affectionate nicknames, having the child's photos prominently displayed, coming over just to see her, and the hygiene issues\u2014are concerning. The fact that the friend went behind their backs to visit the daughter when they were away adds to the concern of overstepping boundaries.\n\nThe author confronted the friend because they felt the behavior was creepy and potentially inappropriate. The friend's defensive reaction and the accusation of being a child molester might be an overreaction, but the author's intent was to set boundaries to protect their daughter. The author's actions were in response to what they perceived as a threat to their child's well-being. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions could be seen as crossing a line, even if not illegal. The author had a responsibility to address it to protect their family. The confrontation might have been direct, but given the potential for harm, it's reasonable. The sister-in-law's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's priority is their child's safety. The friend's defensive response doesn't necessarily make the author wrong; it might indicate the friend's awareness of inappropriate behavior.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect their daughter from what they perceived as a boundary issue. The correct answer would be B.\n"
