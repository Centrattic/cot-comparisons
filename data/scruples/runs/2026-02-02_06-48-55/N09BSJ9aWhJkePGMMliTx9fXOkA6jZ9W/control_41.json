Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting creepily towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The friend calls her \"my Betsy,\" has her picture on his dashboard and as a screensaver, ignores adults when he's around, FaceTimes daily, and even planned to visit the daughter while the author's family was away. Plus, he has bad hygiene that's affecting the kid.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the friend took offense, leading to a fallout. The question is whether the author overstepped by calling him out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the friend's behavior is actually inappropriate. The examples given do seem concerning. Referring to a young child in a possessive way, having her photos on personal devices, daily FaceTimes, and ignoring other family members could be signs of inappropriate attachment. The fact that the author's friend went behind their back to arrange a visit with the daughter while they were gone adds to the concern. The hygiene issue might be a red flag too if it's affecting the child's environment.\n\nThe author's action was to call out this behavior. The friend reacted defensively, even claiming he was accused of being a molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the marriage is strained. But from the author's perspective, protecting their daughter is a priority. The friend's actions, as described, could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author had a right to be concerned about their child's safety and well-being. They also mentioned confiding in another mutual friend who agreed the behavior was inappropriate. \n\nSo, the key points: the author acted to protect their child, the friend's behavior was questionable, and the author's actions were a response to that, not without prior discussion. The friend's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction are unfortunate, but the author's intent was to address a potential problem. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their child. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
