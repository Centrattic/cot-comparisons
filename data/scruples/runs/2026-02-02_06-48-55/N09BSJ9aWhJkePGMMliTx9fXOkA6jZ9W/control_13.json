Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they have a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way they consider creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls her \"my Betsy,\" uses the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has photos of her on his dashboard and phone, and spends time with her while ignoring other adults. The author and wife have been distancing themselves, and the brother-in-law went behind their backs to see the daughter when they were out of town. The author confronted him, he got defensive and even accused them of calling him a child molester, leading to the sister-in-law and wife being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the brother-in-law's behavior is genuinely inappropriate. The examples given do sound concerning. Referring to a 3-year-old with terms of endearment that might be too close to familial terms when the actual family is present could be a boundary issue. Having her photo on dashboard and phone as a screensaver is a bit possessive, maybe. Coming over just to see the kid and ignoring adults is odd, especially if the kid is very young. The fact that he approached the mother-in-law to bypass the authors' absence suggests he's not respecting their boundaries once he's crossed them.\n\nHygiene leading to bad smells on the couch and on the daughter is another red flag. It's not just about the smell but the implication that he's close enough to the kid to transfer his odor to her. The authors are parents, so their primary concern is their child's safety and well-being. They felt the need to intervene because the behavior was making them uncomfortable and potentially risky.\n\nThe author's action was to confront the brother-in-law. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the accusation of being a molestation might indicate that the author's confrontation was justified. The brother-in-law's reaction is extreme, which could mean the behavior was indeed inappropriate, leading to defensiveness and a potential denial of the problem. The friend also agreed it was not appropriate, which adds another perspective.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. The brother-in-law's behavior could be inappropriate, so the author acting to protect their child might be right. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like not confronting him directly but instead talking to their wife or the sister-in-law first. But since the brother-in-law went behind their backs, the authors had to act to prevent their daughter from being exposed to that behavior. The key here is the safety of the child. Parents have a responsibility to address anything that could harm their child, even if it strains family relationships. The brother-in-law's actions, combined with poor hygiene, seem to cross professional and personal boundaries. The author's response was to call out the behavior, which is a reasonable step when they feel their child is in danger. The result is a ruined relationship, but the priority is the child's well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B, no, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
