Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's known his brother-in-law since kindergarten, is now upset because his brother-in-law has been acting inappropriately towards his 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" has her picture on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see her and ignores adults, tries to FaceTime her every day, and even went behind their backs to visit when they were away. Plus, his hygiene is so bad it's affecting the kid.\n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law got defensive, accused him of accusing him of being a child molester. Now the sister-in-law is cutting off contact, and the wife is upset because she might lose her sister over it. The friend agrees that the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior towards a young child and the author's response. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as inappropriate, especially the constant attention and the boundary issues. The author's action was to confront him, which led to conflict. The author had a duty to protect his daughter and his family's well-being. Even though it caused a rift, the author's action was to address what he perceived as a serious issue. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction don't negate the initial inappropriate behavior. The author shouldn't be in the wrong here because he was protecting his family. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
