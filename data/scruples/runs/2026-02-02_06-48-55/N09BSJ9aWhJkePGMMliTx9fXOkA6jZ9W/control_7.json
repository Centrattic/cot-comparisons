Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law (let's call him BIL) has been acting in ways that the author and wife find creepy. Examples include calling the 3-year-old \"my Betsy,\" using the phone's screensaver of her, coming over just to see her, and ignoring adults. Also, he made plans to visit the daughter without the parents knowing, which the author found out about accidentally. Plus, his bad hygiene is a problem, affecting their home environment.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to BIL being defensive and accusing them of calling him a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset and cutting off contact, which is causing strain on the wife's relationship with her sister. The question is whether the author did the right thing or is at fault.\n\nFrom what I see, the author's main concern is the safety and comfort of their daughter. The BIL's behavior is bordering on inappropriate, especially with a young child. The key points here are the BIL's consistent focus on the child, the secrecy involved in seeing her without parents' knowledge, and the physical effects of his poor hygiene. \n\nThe author decided to address the issue after noticing these red flags. Confronting someone about potential inappropriate behavior towards a child is generally considered necessary, especially when there's evidence of the person being in the child's space excessively and in ways that are uncomfortable. The BIL's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction might be due to feeling accused, but the author's main responsibility is to protect their daughter.\n\nI don't see any indication that the author acted without cause. They had multiple examples of concerning behavior and a friend who agreed. The BIL's actions could be misinterpreted, but the author's response is about setting boundaries to protect their child. So, the author probably isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
