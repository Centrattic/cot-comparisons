Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe person has a friend from kindergarten, now in their 40s, who married their sister-in-law. This friend, the brother-in-law, has been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" setting up a picture of her as his screensaver, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, and even going behind their backs to visit the daughter while they were away. The author confronted him, which led to the brother-in-law getting defensive and accusing them of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset and cutting ties, making the wife sad because she might lose her sister over this.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for speaking up. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the brother-in-law's behavior seems concerning. Referring to the daughter in a possessive way, having her image on his phone and dashboard, coming over specifically to see her, and ignoring others could be seen as inappropriate. The fact that he went behind the author's back to visit the daughter while they were away adds to the concern. The hygiene issue might also be a red flag, as it could indicate other issues.\n\nThe author had to confront him, which led to a breakdown in the relationship. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and the sister-in-law's upset reaction complicate things. The wife is caught between two family members, leading to her distress.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and child safety, as a parent, the author has a responsibility to protect their child. If someone is showing excessive, inappropriate attention towards a minor, especially a sibling's child, that's a valid concern. The author isn't just being paranoid; they're taking action to ensure their daughter's well-being. The brother-in-law's response was extreme, possibly deflecting blame onto the author. The fact that another friend agreed with the author's assessment supports that the behavior was indeed inappropriate.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been too direct or confrontational. Maybe they could have approached it more carefully, perhaps involving the sister-in-law first or seeking mediation. But given the circumstances\u2014especially the brother-in-law trying to see the child behind their backs\u2014it's understandable that the author felt they had to act.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were justified. Since the behavior was inappropriate and potentially harmful, confronting the brother-in-law was necessary to protect the child. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their daughter's safety, even if it caused family tension. The brother-in-law's actions were the root of the problem, not the author's response to it.\n"
