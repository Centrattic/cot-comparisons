Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's showing concerning behavior towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the uncle's obsessive actions: calling her \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy nickname, having her picture as a screensaver and dashboard, coming over just to see her while ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and going behind their backs to visit the daughter when they're away. Plus, the uncle's bad hygiene is a problem.\n\nThe author confronted the uncle, who reacted defensively and accused them of false accusations about being a molester. The sister-in-law is now cutting off contact, making the author question if they should have stayed silent.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the uncle's behavior is appropriate. The actions described (constant attention, personal items, sneaking in when the family is away) do seem excessive and potentially inappropriate, especially with a young child. The author's concern about this is valid. Parents have the right to protect their children, and if there's a genuine concern about someone's behavior, addressing it is responsible.\n\nThe uncle's reaction is defensive and extreme, which might indicate he's aware his behavior is problematic. However, that doesn't necessarily make the author at fault. The author's actions were in response to observed behavior that they found creepy and invasive. The author's wife is upset about losing her sister, but the author's priority is the daughter's well-being.\n\nThe hygienic issues add another layer, as it's unhygienic and could affect the child. The author's decision to confront is based on these concerns. The friend agreeing with the behavior being inappropriate supports the author's stance.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing the behavior. The uncle's actions are questionable, and the author acted to protect their family. The fallout in the relationship is unfortunate, but the author's intentions were protective. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
