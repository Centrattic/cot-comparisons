Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's become overly focused on the author's 3-year-old daughter, leading to a broken relationship with the sister-in-law and the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" refers to himself as her uncle in a creepy way, has her picture on his dashboard and as a screensaver, visits just to see the kid, ignores adults, FaceTimes every day, and even tried to come over after the family left town. Plus, his bad hygiene is causing problems. The author confronted him, leading to defensiveness and accusations of being a molester, which caused the sister-in-law to cut off contact and the wife to be upset because she might lose her sister over this.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants the AI's opinion. The question is whether the author should have spoken up or kept quiet. \n\nI should consider societal norms and what's appropriate regarding adult relationships with children. Referring to a 3-year-old in such a possessive way, especially by a family member, can be seen as inappropriate. The brother-in-law's actions include things like having her picture on his phone and dashboard, which might be considered overstepping. The daily FaceTime requests and visiting just to see the child, ignoring adults, those all seem like signs of an unhealthy fixation. \n\nThen there's the issue of confronting him. The author did call him out, but the brother-in-law reacted by accusing them of being a molester. That's a strong reaction. The author's concern is valid, especially since it's their child. The brother-in-law's behavior is making them uncomfortable, and they have a right to set boundaries. The sister-in-law's response seems harsh, but maybe she's in denial about her husband's behavior. \n\nThe wife is upset because she might lose her sister. The author's friend also agreed the behavior was inappropriate. So the author isn't alone in their concerns. But was the confrontation handled properly? The brother-in-law might have felt blindsided, leading to his defensive reaction. However, the author had a right to address the issue, especially when it's about their daughter and involving the mother-in-law. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to counter that. If the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate, then the author isn't wrong for speaking up. The key here is whether the focus was genuinely creepy or if the author overreacted. The examples given suggest the brother-in-law's behavior is crossing lines, so the author isn't at fault. \n\nAlso, considering the potential for harm, even if the brother-in-law didn't have malicious intent, the author has a responsibility to protect their child. The sister-in-law's reaction might stem from feeling attacked or not wanting to believe her husband is doing something wrong. The author's actions were about protecting their family and addressing a boundary violation. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author had valid reasons to be concerned and acted to protect their child and family. The brother-in-law's defensive behavior and the sister-in-law's reaction are on their part, not the author's. The author isn't wrong for standing up for their boundaries and their daughter's well-being.\n"
