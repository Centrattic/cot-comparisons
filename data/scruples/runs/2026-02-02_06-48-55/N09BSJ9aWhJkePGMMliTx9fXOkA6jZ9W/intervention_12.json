Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author found creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law uses terms like \"my Betsy,\" has her photo on his phone and dashboard, comes over just to see the kid, and ignores adults. He even went behind their backs to arrange a visit when they left. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and the sister-in-law cutting off contact. The author's wife is upset about losing her sister, and the author is questioning if they should have stayed quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's behavior does seem concerning. Referring to a child as \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on personal devices, and making plans without the parents' knowledge could be seen as overstepping. The author's main concern is the child's safety and well-being, which is a valid priority. However, the way the author addressed the issue might be problematic. Confronting someone with accusations without prior discussion or evidence could lead to defensiveness. The brother-in-law took offense, interpreting the accusation as a charge of child molestation, which is a serious claim. The author didn't provide evidence, just their perception. Also, involving another friend might not have been the best approach. \n\nBut on the other hand, the behavior described does cross boundaries. Parents have the right to protect their children, and if they perceive a threat, even if it's a misunderstanding, acting on that perception is understandable. The brother-in-law's actions do seem inappropriate, especially the secrecy and focus on the child. The author's confrontation might have been abrupt, but given the circumstances, it's hard to say the author is entirely at fault. The key points here are the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's behavior and the method of the author's response. If the brother-in-law's actions are indeed inappropriate, the author is justified. However, if the author misread the situation, they might be at fault. But given the details provided, the brother-in-law's actions seem to warrant the author's concern. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
