Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards his daughter. The brother-in-law calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" uses his phone's screensaver with her picture, puts her photo on his dashboard, ignores adults when visiting, and even tried to see the child when the parents were away. The author confronted him, leading to a broken relationship and his sister's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the brother-in-law's behavior towards the 3-year-old. The author is the parent, so they have the right to be protective. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially if they're making the parent uncomfortable. The fact that the brother-in-law went behind their backs to see the child when they were away is another red flag. The author's main concern is the child's well-being and safety.\n\nHowever, the brother-in-law reacted defensively and accused the author of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset and cutting off communication. The author's friend also agreed that the behavior was inappropriate. The author's actions were to confront someone they consider a creep, which might be necessary to protect their daughter. On the other hand, maybe the author could have approached it differently, like first talking to their sister-in-law before confronting the brother-in-law directly. But given the seriousness of the situation, especially the unauthorized visit when the parents were away, the author's reaction might be justified. The brother-in-law's behavior is concerning and could be harmful, so the author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
