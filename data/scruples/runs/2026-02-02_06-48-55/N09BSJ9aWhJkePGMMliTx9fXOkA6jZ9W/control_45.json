Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has become overly focused on the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the man's behavior: calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and going behind their backs to visit during a trip. Plus, he smells bad, which is a hygiene issue.\n\nThe writer confronts him, leading to defensiveness and the accusation of being called a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The friend agrees the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's actions are problematic. The man's focus on a 3-year-old could be seen as inappropriately intense. Children that young don't understand boundaries the way older kids or adults do, so adults must be cautious about their attention. The examples given (nicknames, daily contact, etc.) suggest he's overstepping. The fact that he went behind the writer's back to see the daughter is a breach of trust.\n\nHygiene is another issue. Smelling bad and affecting the environment is a separate problem but adds to the overall discomfort. The writer's decision to confront him was necessary to protect their daughter and set boundaries. The brother-in-law's defensive reaction and accusation of molestation are extreme and may indicate he's aware his behavior is inappropriate but is unwilling to acknowledge it.\n\nThe sister-in-law's reaction is also important. She might feel her brother is being unfairly accused, but her distress is real. The wife's position is torn between family and the husband's concerns. The writer's actions were to address a situation that could harm their daughter's well-being. The friend's agreement that the behavior is inappropriate supports the writer's stance.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the brother-in-law's actions are the main issue. The writer acted to protect their child, which is a parent's duty. Confronting him was necessary, even if the relationship suffered. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their daughter's safety and setting boundaries.\n"
