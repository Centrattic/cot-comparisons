Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's shown excessive, potentially inappropriate focus on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior: calling the girl by a nickname, using the term \"uncle\" in a creepy way, having her photo on his dashboard and phone, visiting just to see her, ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and going behind the author's back to see her with the mother-in-law's help. Also, his hygiene issues causing problems.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a defensive response where the brother-in-law was accused of being a child molester, resulting in a breakdown of the relationship. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The author sought a friend's opinion, who agreed the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries. A 3-year-old is very young, and adults showing such intense focus, especially without the parents' consent, is concerning. The fact that the brother-in-law went behind the parents' backs to see the child, even while the mother-in-law was babysitting, suggests he's not respecting the parents' authority. The hygiene issue adds to the concern, as it's a health risk for the child.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the brother-in-law. While the accusation of being a child molester might be extreme, the underlying concern about inappropriate behavior seems valid. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the subsequent fallout are unfortunate, but the author had a duty to protect their child. The friend's agreement supports the author's stance.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They were protecting their child from what they perceived as creepy behavior. The brother-in-law's actions were the issue, not the author's response. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
