Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who has become overly fixated on his sister-in-law's daughter. The key points are the man's behavior towards the 3-year-old, like calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her photo on his dashboard and phone, wanting to FaceTime daily, and coming over just to see her while ignoring adults. Then there's the incident where he tried to visit the kid without the parents' knowledge. The author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and the brother-in-law accusing him of calling him a child molester, causing a rift in the family.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he confronted his friend/brother-in-law about what he perceives as inappropriate behavior towards his daughter. The question is whether that confrontation was justified. The author's main concern is for his daughter's well-being and safety. The brother-in-law's actions do seem concerning\u2014excessive focus on a young child, not respecting boundaries by trying to visit without permission, and poor hygiene that affects the child. The author's duty of care for his daughter would require him to address any potential risks. \n\nHowever, the way he handled it might be an issue. The post mentions that they had been distancing themselves first, then the confrontation led to the brother-in-law's defensive reaction. The author might have approached the situation with strong accusations, which could have been perceived as harsh or accusatory, leading to the breakdown in the relationship. The brother-in-law took offense and escalated it by accusing the author of implying he's a molester, which is a serious charge. \n\nBut considering the behaviors described, even if the approach could have been softer, the underlying issue is about protecting a child. The author's actions were driven by concern for his daughter's safety and well-being, which is a valid reason. The brother-in-law's reaction is problematic, but the author isn't in the wrong for standing up to protect his family. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since there's a clear boundary violation (the brother-in-law trying to see the child without permission, excessive attention), the author was justified in addressing it. The brother-in-law's defensive response doesn't make the author wrong; it highlights the brother-in-law's issues. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The author acted in his daughter's best interest, and while communication style matters, the core issue is about protecting a child from potentially inappropriate attention.\n"
