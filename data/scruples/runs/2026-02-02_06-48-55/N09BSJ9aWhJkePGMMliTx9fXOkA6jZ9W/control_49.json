Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who posted this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that he's a long-time friend and brother-in-law to his wife's sister. The brother-in-law has been acting in a way that they consider creepy towards his 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" using his own name as her uncle in a creepy way, having her picture on the dashboard, as his phone screensaver, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, trying to FaceTime daily, and even going behind their backs to visit when they were out of town. Plus, his hygiene is bad, which makes him smell bad around the kid.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law being defensive and feeling accused of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset and cutting off contact, making the wife sad because she might lose her sister. The author's friend agreed that the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The brother-in-law's behavior is concerning. The examples given do sound inappropriate, especially with a young child. Referring to the child in a possessive way, having her image on his phone and dashboard, and making plans without the parents' knowledge could be seen as overstepping boundaries. The author had a duty to protect his daughter, so confronting the brother-in-law seems reasonable. However, the way he confronted him might have been harsh if it led to the brother-in-law feeling accused of something serious without evidence. \n\nBut considering the context, the author was trying to protect his daughter from someone who was behaving in a way that could be harmful. The brother-in-law's defensive response and the subsequent fallout might be his fault for overreacting. However, the author might have handled the confrontation differently to avoid damaging the relationship so abruptly. Maybe a more private or less direct approach could have been better, but given the potential risk to the child, the author's actions were in the child's best interest. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The key points are the brother-in-law's inappropriate behavior, the author's right to protect his child, and the method of confrontation. Since the behavior was concerning and the author had a responsibility to act, it's more likely that he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
