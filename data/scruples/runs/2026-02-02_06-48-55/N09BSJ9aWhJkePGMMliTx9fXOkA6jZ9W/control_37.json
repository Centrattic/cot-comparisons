Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend and brother-in-law who's been acting oddly towards the author's 3-year-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother-in-law is a long-time friend, but in the past year, he's shown excessive attention to the daughter. Examples include nicknames, having her photo on his dashboard and phone, visiting just to see her, and ignoring adults. The author found out he planned to visit their daughter without their knowledge while they were away. The brother-in-law got defensive, accused the author of implying he's a child molester, leading to a fallout with the sister-in-law.\n\nThe author's actions: they confronted the brother-in-law about the behavior. The sister-in-law is upset and cut off communication. The wife is torn because she might lose her sister. The user is asking if the author was wrong to speak up.\n\nNow, considering boundaries, a 3-year-old's safety is paramount. The brother-in-law's actions, while not explicit abuse, are certainly concerning. The author had a duty to protect their daughter and set boundaries. The brother-in-law's reaction being defensive and aggressive doesn't absolve him of responsibility. The author didn't make a false accusation; they based their concerns on observed behavior. The sister-in-law's reaction might stem from her partner's defensiveness rather than the author's approach. The friend also agreed it was inappropriate, so the author wasn't acting out of nowhere.\n\nPossible counterpoints: maybe the author should have handled it privately first, but given the behind-the-back actions, confrontation was necessary. The BO issue could be a sign of other problems. The main issue is the inappropriate focus on a child, which is a serious red flag. The author protecting their child isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
