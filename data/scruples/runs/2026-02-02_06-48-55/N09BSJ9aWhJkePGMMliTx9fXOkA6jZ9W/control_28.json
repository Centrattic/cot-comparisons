Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is a long-time friend and brother-in-law to the author. He's been showing a lot of attention towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The examples given are that he calls her \"my Betsy,\" refers to himself as \"uncle\" in a creepy way, has her picture on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see her, ignores the adults, FaceTimes daily, and even tried to see her when the author and wife were away. Plus, his hygiene is bad, which is affecting the daughter. \n\nThe author confronted him, and the brother-in-law got defensive, even accusing the author of implying he's a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The user's friend agrees the behavior is inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's behavior is actually inappropriate. The key here is the age of the daughter\u20143 years old. Any adult showing excessive focus on a child that young, especially with personal items like photos on phone and dashboard, daily contact, and ignoring adults, can be seen as concerning. The hygiene issue adds another layer, as it's unhygienic and potentially harmful to the child.\n\nThe author's actions: they confronted the brother-in-law when they found out he was trying to see the daughter behind their backs. The brother-in-law's reaction was defensive and he escalated the situation by bringing up molestation. The sister-in-law's reaction is understandable if she feels accused, but the author's main concern was the child's well-being.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author was protecting their daughter from someone whose behavior they found creepy and possibly inappropriate. The brother-in-law's actions were over the line, so the author's confrontation was a response to that. The author didn't just confront without reason; they had built-up concerns. The friend also agreed it was inappropriate. So, the author acted to protect their child, which is a parent's responsibility. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
