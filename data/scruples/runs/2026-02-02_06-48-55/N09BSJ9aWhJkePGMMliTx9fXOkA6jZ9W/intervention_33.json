Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter. The brother-in-law in question has been acting in ways the family finds creepy\u2014calling the daughter by a nickname, having her photo on his dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, FaceTiming daily, and even trying to visit without the parents' knowledge. The author confronted him, leading to the brother-in-law feeling accused of being a child molester and the sister-in-law cutting off communication.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The key points are the brother-in-law's behavior towards the daughter and the author's response. The brother-in-law's actions do seem concerning. Having a child's photo as a screensaver, making unilateral plans to see the child when parents are away, and the hygiene issues could be red flags. The author's concern for their daughter's safety is valid, especially since they had to intervene when the brother-in-law tried to visit without their knowledge.\n\nHowever, the way the author confronted the brother-in-law might have been harsh. Accusing someone of being a child molester is a serious allegation and could be seen as an overreaction, even if the intention was to protect the child. The author might not have provided the brother-in-law an opportunity to explain his actions or address the concerns in a more constructive manner. Instead, a direct confrontation leading to such a severe accusation could have been perceived as hostile, which explains the defensive response.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's responsibility to protect their daughter is paramount. If the brother-in-law's behavior continued unchecked, it could pose a real risk. The author had tried to distance themselves gradually, but the brother-in-law's actions escalated. The author's friend also agreed with the concern, suggesting it wasn't just a personal issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intentions were to protect their daughter, which is understandable. However, the method of confrontation might have been overly aggressive and could have contributed to the breakdown of the relationships. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been more tactful. The main issue is the brother-in-law's behavior, not necessarily the author's decision to address it. Hence, the answer would be B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
