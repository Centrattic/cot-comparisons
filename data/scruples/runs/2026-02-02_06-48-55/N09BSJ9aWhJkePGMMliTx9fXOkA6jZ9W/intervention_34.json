Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's acting creepily towards the author's 3-year-old daughter. The examples given are calling her \"my Betsy,\" referring to himself as the uncle in a creepy way, having her photo on the dashboard and phone, coming over just to see her and ignoring adults, FaceTiming every day, and even going behind their backs to see her when the parents are out of town. Plus, his bad hygiene is a problem.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author should have kept their mouth shut. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the brother-in-law's behavior is inappropriate. The actions described do cross into creepy territory, especially with a young child. Having a child's photo on the dashboard and phone, along with consistent over-attention, could be seen as concerning. The author's response was to call him out, which led to the brother-in-law becoming defensive and accusing them of implying he's a molester. The sister-in-law is upset, and the author's wife is worried about losing her sister. \n\nThe key points here are the brother-in-law's behavior towards a young child and the author's method of addressing it. The author's actions were to confront the brother-in-law, which is understandable given the situation. However, the user is considering if they were wrong to do so. \n\nOn one hand, the brother-in-law's actions are definitely inappropriate. A 3-year-old should not be the focus of such attention from an adult, especially a relative. The author had a duty to protect their daughter, so addressing the behavior is justified. On the other hand, the way the author confronted him might have been abrupt or harsh, leading to the defensive reaction. But even if so, the behavior being addressed is serious. \n\nThe user's friend also agreed it was not appropriate, which supports the author's concern. The brother-in-law's defensive move to being accused of being a molester is an overreaction, but the author's main issue is the behavior towards the child. \n\nSo, the author's actions were in response to potentially harmful behavior, which makes them not in the wrong. The brother-in-law is possibly the one at fault here. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
