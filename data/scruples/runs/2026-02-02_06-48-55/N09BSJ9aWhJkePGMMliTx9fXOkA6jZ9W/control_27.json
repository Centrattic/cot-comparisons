Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's showing inappropriate focus on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The key points here are the behaviors described: the man calling the daughter \"my Betsy,\" using the phone screen saver and dashboard picture, coming over just to see her, ignoring adults, daily FaceTime, and even trying to visit while the parents were away. Plus, his bad hygiene causing issues.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction and a rift with the sister-in-law. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nFirst, let's consider the red flags in the behavior. The brother-in-law's actions seem to cross boundaries. Referring to the child as \"his\" or using terms like \"uncle\" in a creepy way might be inappropriate. The constant attention, especially from an adult to a young child, can be concerning and might be seen as overstepping. The fact that he made plans without the parents' knowledge adds to the concern, as parents have the right to control who interacts with their children.\n\nHygiene issues are a separate problem but contribute to an overall image of someone possibly not trustworthy. The author's wife is upset about losing her sister, but the author's actions were to protect their daughter. The friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate, which supports the author's perspective.\n\nNow, was the author wrong to confront him? Confronting someone about behavior that could harm their relationship with your child is generally justified. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the accusation of being a child molester is problematic, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong. The author had a duty to act in their daughter's best interest. The sister-in-law's reaction might stem from feeling accused, but the author's primary responsibility is to their family's safety and well-being.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have communicated differently or involved other family members first. However, given the seriousness of the situation and the immediate threat to their child's safety, direct confrontation might be necessary. The author's actions were to prevent harm, which is a strong justification.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing the inappropriate behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
