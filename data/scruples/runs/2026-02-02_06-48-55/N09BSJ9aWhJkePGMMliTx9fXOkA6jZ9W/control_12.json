Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's developed an unusual focus on the writer's 3-year-old daughter. The brother-in-law calls her \"my Betsy,\" has her picture on his dashboard and phone, comes over just to see her, ignores adults, and even tried to visit when the writer's family was away. The writer confronted him, leading to a breakdown in relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the writer did something wrong by confronting their friend/brother-in-law. The key points here are the behaviors described: the brother-in-law's obsession with a very young child, which is concerning. The writer felt it was necessary to address this because of the potential risk to their daughter. The brother-in-law took it as an accusation of being a child molester, which escalated things.\n\nI should consider the context. The brother-in-law's actions are definitely inappropriate, especially with a 3-year-old. The writer had a duty to protect their daughter, so confronting the brother-in-law about his behavior was necessary. The brother-in-law might have taken offense, but that doesn't mean the writer was wrong. The sister-in-law's reaction is also a result of the brother-in-law's defensiveness, not the writer's initial concern.\n\nThe writer did mention confiding in a mutual friend who agreed the behavior was not appropriate. That supports the idea that there was a valid concern. The brother-in-law's actions, like going behind their backs to see the daughter, are problematic. The writer's actions were a response to protect their child, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the writer is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
