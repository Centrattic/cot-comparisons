Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's become overly focused on the author's 3-year-old daughter. The key points are the excessive attention, the behavior that's creepy, and the author confronting him after he made plans behind their backs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the appropriateness of the brother-in-law's actions. The examples given are pretty extreme: calling the child \"my Betsy,\" using a creepy tone, having her photo in his car and on his phone, coming over to see her while ignoring adults, and even the hygiene issue. This sounds like inappropriate and potentially concerning behavior, especially towards a young child. The fact that the brother-in-law went behind their backs to see the daughter after they left adds to the problem.\n\nThe author decided to confront him, which led to a defensive reaction and the relationship breaking down. The sister-in-law is upset, and the wife is torn because she might lose her sister. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing by speaking up.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's a duty to protect a child from any form of molestation or inappropriate attention. Even if the brother-in-law isn't a known predator, the behavior described is troubling. The author's actions were to address the issue, which seems justified. The brother-in-law's defensive response and the sister-in-law's reaction don't negate the initial problem. The hygiene issue also contributes to an unhealthy environment for the child.\n\nFriends agreeing that the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's decision. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their daughter and addressing the situation. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
