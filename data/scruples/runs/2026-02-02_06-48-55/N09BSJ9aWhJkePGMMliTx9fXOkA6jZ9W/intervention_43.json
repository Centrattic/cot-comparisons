Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their brother-in-law about his behavior towards their 3-year-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the brother-in-law has been showing signs of inappropriate focus on the daughter. He calls her \"my Betsy,\" uses his phone's screensaver for her, has a picture on his dashboard, and comes over just to see her while ignoring adults. He also tried to visit when the parents were away, which the author found out through a call. Plus, his hygiene is bad, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author confronted him, leading to a defensive reaction where the brother-in-law felt accused of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is now upset, and the wife is worried about losing her sister. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know the analysis.\n\nKey points: The author's actions were to protect their daughter from what they perceive as creepy behavior. The brother-in-law's actions are concerning, potentially inappropriate, and the author acted to address this. The confrontation might have been harsh but was intended to stop possible harm. The brother-in-law's defensiveness and the sister-in-law's reaction don't absolve him of the behavior. The author's responsibility to protect their child likely outweighs the relationship's strain. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because addressing potential harm to a child is justified, even if it strains relationships. The brother-in-law's behavior is the main issue here.\n"
