Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting his friend/brother-in-law about his behavior towards their daughter.\n\nFirst, the situation: the brother-in-law has been overly focused on the 3-year-old daughter. Examples include calling her \"my Betsy,\" having her picture on his dashboard, screensaver, FaceTiming every day, and even going to see her when the parents weren't home. The hygiene issue is also a problem, affecting the daughter.\n\nThe author and his wife have been distancing themselves. The brother-in-law went behind their backs to plan a visit with the daughter, and when confronted, he got defensive and accused the author of accusing him of being a child molester. Now the sister-in-law is cutting off contact, and the wife is upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to speak up. \n\nFrom a parent's perspective, protecting their child's well-being is a top priority. The brother-in-law's behavior seems inappropriate and could be a safety concern. The author has a right to address what he perceives as a threat, especially if he noticed changes in the person's behavior over time. The brother-in-law's reaction being defensive and making accusations doesn't make the author wrong; he was trying to protect his daughter.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. Did the author approach the situation calmly? The user says he \"called him out,\" which might have been confrontational. But the brother-in-law's actions were escalating, including going behind their backs. The hygiene issue adds another layer of concern for the child's environment.\n\nThe mother-in-law's involvement (allowing the brother-in-law to see the daughter without the parents' knowledge) is a breach of trust. The author had a right to be upset about that. The friend agreeing that the behavior was inappropriate supports the author's stance.\n\nPotential issues: Maybe the author could have handled it differently first, like talking to his wife or the sister-in-law before confronting the brother-in-law. But given the brother-in-law's actions, it's understandable that he felt the need to act directly to stop the behavior. The key here is the child's safety and well-being. Parents have the responsibility to protect their children, and the brother-in-law's actions cross boundaries. So, I think the author is in the right. The answer should be B.\n"
