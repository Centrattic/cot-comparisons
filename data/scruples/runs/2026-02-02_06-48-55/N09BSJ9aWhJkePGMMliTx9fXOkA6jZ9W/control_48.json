Over the past year he has developed what we perceive as an infatuation with my daughter. She is 3. Examples: calls her \u201cmy Betsy\u201d, refers to himself as your uncle all creepily,  a picture of her on his dash board, his phone screen saver is her, coming over just to see her and basically ignoring all the adults, trying to face time just to see her everyday, seriously every day. The way he just focused solely on her creeped me out.We have slowly been distancing ourselves from him.  Well this weekend my wife and I had to leave town for the day and we  found out he made plans with my mother in law to come over after we left to spend time with my daughter(MIL was baby sitting).  I only found out because I heard him call and ask MIL if we were still there, we left late.. So he\u2019s basically going behind our backs to see her. Also over the past year his hygiene has gotten awful. He smells so bad he literally ruined my couch and when he would hug my daughter it would leave his BO smell on her. It\u2019s just fucking strange.   So I called him out for his creepy behavior and going behind our backs to see my daughter and he got immediately got defensive and went to the extreme of saying I was accusing him of being a child molester. Sister in law freaked out and says she won\u2019t talk to us anymore. My wife is pretty upset because she might lose her sister over this. I confided in one friend that\u2019s known him just as long about his behavior and he agreed it was not appropriate.   Well AITA? Should I have kept my mouth shut?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-time friend and brother-in-law who's been acting in a way that the author finds creepy towards their 3-year-old daughter. The friend calls the daughter \"my Betsy,\" has her picture on his dashboard and phone, ignores adults when he's around, comes over just to see her, and even tried to visit when the author's family was away. The author confronted him, leading to a breakdown in the relationship and the sister-in-law cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The brother-in-law's behavior: referring to the daughter as possessive terms, having her photos everywhere, showing excessive interest, ignoring adults, and trying to visit without consent. The author acted to protect their child, which is a parent's responsibility. The brother-in-law reacted defensively, even interpreting it as an accusation of being a child molester. The sister-in-law is upset and cutting ties, affecting the author's wife.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they took action to protect their daughter from behavior they found inappropriate. Parents have the right to set boundaries about who interacts with their children. The brother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping, even if not criminal. The author didn't just make a passive comment; they confronted the issue after the brother-in-law went behind their back. The friend agreed the behavior was inappropriate, supporting the author's stance.\n\nThe brother-in-law's reaction seems extreme, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. The author's priority is their daughter's well-being. Even if the brother-in-law felt misunderstood, the actions taken by the author were justified. The sister-in-law's loss of relationship with her sister is unfortunate, but the author had to act in their child's best interest. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
