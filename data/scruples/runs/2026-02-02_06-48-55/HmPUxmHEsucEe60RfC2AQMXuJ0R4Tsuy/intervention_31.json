I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a pregnant wife not allowing her husband to take their daughter on a skiing trip, even though the husband's parents and brother will be there to help. The husband feels he's being unfairly restricted, especially since he's been allowed alone with the daughter before, albeit in limited amounts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She had a miscarriage a year ago, which is a traumatic experience. Now that she's pregnant again, her anxiety might be heightened. She's worried about her health and the new pregnancy, and the husband's planned absence might add to her stress. She doesn't trust the husband or her in-laws with the daughter, which could be due to past experiences or her current emotional state. Her refusal might be more about her anxiety than the actual safety of their daughter.\n\nOn the husband's side, he feels he's being treated unfairly. He's been allowed alone with their daughter before, like when the wife had a school event. He also mentions that his parents and brother are willing to help. The husband might be trying to spend quality time with his daughter as a father, which he believes is important for their relationship. He might feel that his autonomy in parenting is being restricted, especially since he hasn't caused any serious harm to their daughter.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's past trauma (miscarriage) and her current pregnancy, which are significant stressors. The husband's desire to spend time with his daughter is valid, but the wife's fear and lack of trust might be affecting her decision. The husband's argument that he's been allowed before could be a point, but since the daughter is almost 5, maybe the wife's concerns are evolving as the child grows. However, the husband's energetic playstyle might be a point of contention if the wife feels it's risky.\n\nI need to determine if the husband is in the wrong. If the wife's decision is rooted in her anxiety and past trauma, it's understandable. The husband might not be doing anything wrong per se, but maybe he's not addressing his wife's emotional needs. He's also not considering her perspective enough, perhaps. He might be pushing for his own needs without acknowledging her current mental state. \n\nAlternatively, the wife's refusal could be overprotective and not based on reality. The husband could be in the right if he's being reasonable and the wife is being overly controlling. But given the context of her pregnancy and past miscarriage, her feelings are legitimate. The husband's approach might be dismissive of her anxiety rather than supportive.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the husband being in the right if he's trying to foster a relationship with his daughter. But if he's not considering his wife's mental health and past trauma, he might be in the wrong. The fact that she's having a hard time trusting him or his parents adds complexity. The husband's insistence on going despite her concerns could be seen as not supporting her during a vulnerable time.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the wife's history and current state, the husband might be in the wrong for not fully acknowledging her feelings and needs, even if his intentions are good. He should prioritize his wife's mental health and find a compromise that addresses both their needs.\n"
