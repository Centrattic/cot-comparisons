I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband wanting to take his daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and brother's family, but the wife, who's pregnant, is refusing to let him take the daughter. The wife previously had a miscarriage and is now very nervous about the author's interactions with their daughter, even though the author has never hurt her. The wife doesn't trust him or his parents when it comes to the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author feels he's being unreasonable denied, especially since the parents and brother are available to help. He mentions he plays energetically with his daughter, which is typical for a father. However, the wife's reasons are based on her past miscarriage and her fear that the author's actions are causing her stress. She also feels he's too influenced by his parents and not standing up for her.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's mental health and the trust issue. The wife's anxiety is legitimate because she's pregnant and has had a miscarriage. High stress can be a factor in pregnancy complications, so her fear might be contributing to her not wanting to let the daughter go on the trip. The author's actions, like playing energetically, might not be harmful, but the wife's perception of risk is real to her. \n\nAlso, the wife has been the primary caregiver, as the daughter was never left alone with the author for long periods. Now she's denying him the opportunity to take the daughter, which the author might see as unfair, but the wife's trust hasn't been built up in that way. The author might need to consider compromising, maybe finding a middle ground where the wife feels secure but he can still have time with the daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be a present father and wants quality time with his daughter. The parents are willing to help, which is a good support system. But the wife's refusal could stem from deep-seated anxiety. The author might need to validate her feelings, ensure her comfort, and perhaps find another time when she's not pregnant for the ski trip.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's trying to assert his right to spend time with his daughter, but he might not be considering the wife's emotional state enough. If he's not respecting her boundaries and her fears, especially during pregnancy, that could be seen as negligent. However, if he's acting within reasonable limits and the wife's fears are irrational despite his good intentions, maybe he's not in the wrong. But given the wife's history and current state, the author might need to prioritize her well-being over his desire for the trip. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but he needs to approach the situation with more empathy and find a solution that addresses both his and his wife's needs. However, if the wife's refusal is based on legitimate concerns about her health and the author is not being considerate, maybe he's partially at fault. But since he hasn't actually hurt the daughter and is trying to be a good father, perhaps he's not in the wrong. The main issue is the wife's trust and anxiety, which might not be his fault but requires his understanding.\n"
