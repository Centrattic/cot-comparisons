I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a pregnant wife not allowing her husband to take their daughter on a skiing trip, even though the parents and other family members are present.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels that he's a responsible father, as the daughter has only had minor injuries and he plays energetically, which he thinks is part of being a dad. The wife is pregnant again after a previous miscarriage, so she's anxious. She doesn't trust the husband or his parents with the child, leading to arguments. The husband is upset because he wants to take the daughter on this trip.\n\nThe core issue here is the wife's lack of trust. Even if the husband isn't at fault in terms of actual harm, the wife's anxiety and past trauma (miscarriage) are significant. Her fear might be causing her to be overprotective. The husband might think he's being reasonable, but the wife's emotional state is a key factor. Also, the wife is pregnant, so her stress could affect her health, which the husband isn't considering by pushing for the trip.\n\nThe husband's actions aren't necessarily wrong in terms of parenting, but he might be missing the emotional impact of his wife's anxiety. He's trying to assert his parental role, but the wife's trauma and current pregnancy make her perspective valid. The fact that she's having constant fights and blames him for increasing her stress is a big deal. He might need to acknowledge her feelings and find a middle ground instead of insisting on the trip.\n\nSo, considering the wife's mental health and the recent miscarriage, the husband's insistence might be adding to her stress, which could be harmful. Therefore, the author (husband) might be in the wrong for not addressing his wife's emotional needs and pushing the issue despite her concerns.\n"
