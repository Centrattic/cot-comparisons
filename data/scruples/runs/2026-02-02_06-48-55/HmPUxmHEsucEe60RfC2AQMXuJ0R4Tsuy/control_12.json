I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nSo, the husband wants to take their 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and brother's family. The wife is pregnant and doesn't want to go, which the husband understands. But she's also denying him taking their daughter, even though his parents and brother are there to help. She doesn't trust him or his parents with their daughter. They had a miscarriage before, and now she's worried it might happen again because of stress from the argument.\n\nThe husband says he's never injured the daughter, just a bruise once. He likes to play energetic with her as a father. They've had this fight 20 times. The wife feels he's always doing what his parents say and not supporting her. The question is whether the husband is at fault here.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The wife is pregnant, which makes her more sensitive, especially after a miscarriage. Her anxiety is causing her to deny the husband's request. She doesn't trust him or his parents with the daughter. The husband feels he's being unfairly restricted, especially since the parents are willing to help. He also mentions that he wants to have active play with their daughter, which might be a point of contention.\n\nFirst, the wife's health and safety as a pregnant woman need to be considered. If her stress from the argument could lead to complications, that's a valid concern. The husband's desire to spend time with his daughter is understandable, but he has to balance it with his wife's current emotional and physical state. \n\nBut the wife's lack of trust in him and his parents is an issue. Even if he hasn't harmed the daughter before, her trust is a factor. Maybe there's past issues the husband isn't aware of? Or maybe the wife feels unsupported in her parenting role. The husband accuses her of not trusting him, but he's also saying he does what his parents tell him, which might not help his case. If the wife feels he's not standing up for her, that could be part of the problem.\n\nThe key points are the wife's pregnancy, her history of miscarriage, her anxiety affecting the pregnancy, and the lack of trust. The husband wants to spend quality time with his daughter, but the wife's health and safety are paramount. If allowing him to go on the trip would cause her stress that could risk the pregnancy, then he might need to prioritize her well-being over his own desire to go. However, the wife might be overreacting if there's no medical evidence that the stress is harmful. \n\nAlso, the wife's constant denial and the 20th fight suggest a communication breakdown. The husband might not be addressing her concerns adequately. Maybe he's not showing enough empathy towards her situation. If he's not standing up for her, as she claims, that could be a mistake. On the other hand, he's trying to assert his role as a father. It's a balance between respecting the wife's health and the child's needs.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not a clear-cut answer. Both have valid points. But if the wife's health is at risk due to the stress, the husband might need to comply with her wishes to protect her and the unborn child. If he pushes against her concerns, he could be in the wrong. However, if she's being overly restrictive without medical justification, then maybe she's the one at fault. But given the context of her recent pregnancy and past miscarriage, her anxiety might be legitimate. So, the husband's insistence could be contributing to her stress, making him partly at fault. But he's also trying to have a normal father-daughter activity. It's a tough call, but the answer might lean towards the husband needing to be more accommodating to his wife's current situation.\n"
