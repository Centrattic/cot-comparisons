I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a pregnant wife who refuses to let him take their daughter on a skiing trip, even though he's had some previous issues with being allowed alone with her. The author argues that he's a good father, there's no history of injury, and he's been given more trust over time. His wife is concerned, especially after a past miscarriage, and she's not trusting him or his parents with their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant and anxious, which can heighten emotions. Her past experience with a miscarriage might make her more cautious. Trust is a big issue here. If she's not trusting him, maybe she feels he's not responsible enough. But the author says he's never hurt the daughter and plays energetically, which he thinks is part of being a father. The key points are trust, past experiences, and the wife's current emotional state.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he wants to spend time with his daughter and feels his wife isn't trusting him. But the wife's refusal might stem from genuine fear and lack of trust. He mentions she accuses him of always going with his parents' advice, implying he's not standing up for her. That could mean he's not addressing her concerns effectively.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe. If he's not considering her feelings and the reasons behind her distrust, he might be. He needs to validate her concerns rather than push back. However, he's also trying to spend time with his daughter, which is understandable. The problem might be communication gaps. But since the wife is pregnant and more vulnerable, the author's persistence could be exacerbating her anxiety. The fact that she's having another child doesn't mean her existing concerns about her daughter's safety are invalid. The author might need to work on building trust with his wife, showing he can be responsible without her constant oversight, but if he's already been given some independence, maybe her refusal is unreasonable. However, her past miscarriage adds a layer of trauma that affects her current decisions. So, the author might be in the wrong for not fully acknowledging her fears and pushing for his own desires without considering her mental state. Alternatively, if the wife's distrust is unwarranted, he might not be wrong. But since he's had limited time with the daughter before, maybe the wife has valid reasons for her caution. The answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because he's not addressing his wife's valid emotional concerns and is pushing for his needs without considering her anxiety, especially during pregnancy and after a miscarriage.\n"
