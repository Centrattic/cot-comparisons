I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a pregnant wife who doesn't allow her husband to take their daughter on a skiing trip even though the author thinks it's reasonable because his parents and brother will be there. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The wife has been very controlling about the daughter's care, not letting the husband alone with her for even short periods initially. Now that she's pregnant and has a history of a miscarriage, she's more anxious. She's worried that the husband's insistence on going skiing might stress her and risk another miscarriage.\n\nThe husband feels he's a good father, hasn't hurt the daughter, and wants to bond with her. He's frustrated because his wife isn't trusting him or his parents. He's also upset that she accuses him of just following his parents instead of standing up for her.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong? Well, the wife's anxiety is understandable given her pregnancy and past miscarriage. Her restrictions on the husband's time with the daughter are strict, but maybe they were out of fear before. Now, with her current state, her refusal might stem from genuine medical concerns. The husband wants to go skiing, which is a valid desire for family time, but he needs to consider his wife's health. If her stress could lead to complications, he might be in the wrong for pushing despite her wishes. However, he's also a parent who wants to spend time with his child, which is valid too. \n\nBut the wife's trust issues might be part of the problem. She doesn't trust the husband or his parents enough to let them take care of their daughter even with family there. However, her health is a critical factor here. The husband's actions could inadvertently affect her pregnancy. So he might need to prioritize her well-being over his plans. Therefore, the author (husband) might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her medical concerns and the emotional stress it's causing her. But maybe the wife is overstepping by not allowing any time with the daughter. It's a balance between parental rights and health risks. Since the wife is pregnant and at risk, the husband's insistence might be the issue here. So the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering his wife's health and stress, which could lead to complications.\n"
