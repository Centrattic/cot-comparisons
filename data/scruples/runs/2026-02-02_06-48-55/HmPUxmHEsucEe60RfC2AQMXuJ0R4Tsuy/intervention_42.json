I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife who won't let the husband take their daughter on a skiing trip. The husband is frustrated because he feels his wife doesn't trust him or his parents to take care of their daughter. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is worried it might happen again, especially because she's stressed by the argument. The husband wants to take the daughter skiing with his parents and brother's family there, but the wife is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's a responsible father and wants to spend time with his daughter, playing energetically, which he sees as a father's role. He's been allowed alone time with the child before, and now that the trip is planned, he's upset that his wife is denying it. The wife's side is that she's pregnant, anxious, and has a history of a miscarriage, so her stress levels are high. She doesn't trust the husband or his parents to take care of their daughter during the trip, even though the parents are willing to help.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's current health and emotional state, the history of a miscarriage, and the husband's desire for a specific parenting role. The wife's refusal might be rooted in her fear of stress affecting her pregnancy. It's important to validate her concerns, especially given her past experience. The husband's energetic playtime could be a point of contention if the wife feels it's risky. The fact that she's had 20 fights on the same issue suggests a deeper issue in their communication. The husband might be dismissing her valid worries, which could make him at fault. On the other hand, the wife's lack of trust might be overprotective or based on past experiences. \n\nI should check if the husband's actions are reasonable. The skiing trip is a planned event with family support, but the wife's mental health during pregnancy is crucial. If her anxiety is real and the husband is not acknowledging her feelings, he might be in the wrong. The wife's request to avoid stress is understandable, and if the trip is a source of stress for her, he should consider her well-being. The husband's role in playing energetically might be a red flag if the wife feels that's unsafe for the daughter. However, the wife's refusal to allow even the parents to help could indicate an overreaction, but the context of her pregnancy and past trauma is important. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) if the wife's concerns are legitimate and the husband isn't taking them seriously. Alternatively, if the husband is being reasonable and the wife's distrust is unfounded, maybe B. But given the wife's health situation and the number of fights, it seems like the husband is not respecting her boundaries during this vulnerable time. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
