I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants to take their daughter on a ski trip, but the pregnant wife is refusing to let him go. The wife had a miscarriage before, and now she's worried the stress might cause another one. The husband feels like he's being denied time with his daughter and is frustrated because he's allowed to be alone with her sometimes, like when his mom or kindergarten takes care of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is pregnant, which can be a stressful time, especially with a history of miscarriage. Her anxiety about the trip might be legitimate. She might feel that the husband's insistence on going is adding to her stress, which could be harmful. On the other hand, the husband is trying to spend quality time with their daughter, which is important for a father's role. He argues that he's never harmed the child and just wants to play with her. \n\nBut the wife's trust in the husband's ability to care for the daughter seems to be an issue. Even if he's done okay in the past, her current lack of trust could be due to the pregnancy making her more anxious. She's also feeling unsupported because he's following his parents' advice instead of standing up for her. That could be hurting their relationship. \n\nThe key points here are the wife's health and emotional state during pregnancy, the potential risk of stress leading to another miscarriage, and the husband's need for bonding time with his daughter. The husband might not be in the wrong if he's acting in good faith to be a present father, but he also needs to consider his wife's well-being. If the wife's doctors have advised her to avoid stress, then the husband's insistence might not be considerate. However, if there's no medical evidence that the trip would harm her, then maybe the husband isn't wrong to want to spend time with his daughter.\n\nBut the wife's feelings are important too. The husband's actions could be undermining her confidence in their parenting dynamic. He should try to find a middle ground, like maybe a different activity that's less stressful for her, or finding a way to spend time with the daughter that doesn't involve the ski trip if that's what the wife needs. The fact that they're fighting so much and it's affecting their relationship might mean the husband is being inconsiderate of her emotional state. \n\nSo, balancing the husband's desire to bond with his daughter against the wife's health and stress, the husband might be in the wrong if he's not taking her concerns seriously enough. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not addressing her valid concerns about her pregnancy and the potential risks, instead pushing for his own needs without considering her health."
