I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband wanting to take their daughter on a ski trip with his parents and brother's family, but the wife, who is pregnant and had a miscarriage, is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife has historically been very cautious about leaving the daughter with the husband, limiting his alone time with her. Now that she's pregnant, her anxiety might be heightened, especially after a previous miscarriage. The husband feels he's being unfairly denied the chance to bond with his daughter, especially since the parents and brother are supportive. \n\nThe key points are the wife's trust issues, her pregnancy-related anxiety, and the husband's desire for quality time. The wife's past behavior shows she has concerns about the husband's parenting style (he mentions playing energetic, which she might see as risky). The wife's health and emotional state are also important\u2014pregnancy after a miscarriage can be stressful. \n\nThe husband isn't being negligent; he's been allowed some time with the daughter before. However, the wife's refusal might stem from valid fears based on past experiences. The husband might feel wronged because he's trying to spend time with the child, but the wife's perspective is about protecting both the daughter and the unborn child from stress.\n\nI should weigh both sides. The husband's actions are reasonable, but the wife's anxiety and history complicate things. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for pushing despite her concerns. Since the wife is pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, her needs and feelings are critical. The husband might not be in the wrong per se, but he needs to consider her emotional state. However, the wife's refusal could be seen as overprotectiveness. But given the context, maybe the husband is overstepping by not respecting her current emotional state. So, perhaps the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's not adequately addressing her anxiety and history, insisting on taking the daughter despite her valid concerns.\n"
