I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband wants to take their 5-year-old daughter skiing with his parents and brother's family, but the pregnant wife (who had a miscarriage a year ago) is refusing. She doesn't trust him or his parents with the daughter. The husband feels he's been allowed more time alone with the daughter since she was 3, and he's frustrated because he's not getting to spend time with her. He also mentions that the daughter adores his parents and his brother's kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant again after a miscarriage, which might be causing her anxiety. Her trust in the husband and his parents isn't there, even though he says he's never hurt the daughter. Maybe past experiences or her current emotional state are affecting her. She might feel that any stress or issue during the ski trip could risk her pregnancy, especially if she's worried about another miscarriage. Her not trusting him could be due to fear rather than a belief that he's a bad parent. Also, she's mentioned that he's been influenced by his parents, which might be making her feel unsupported in her decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels he's been given more responsibility over time and wants to bond with their daughter. He's trying to assert his parental role by being more involved and energetic with her play. The fact that his parents and brother are available to help seems like a solid support system. The daughter's age (almost 5) might mean she's more independent, but the wife's trust is still a key factor here.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The key points are the wife's anxiety from her past and current pregnancy, her lack of trust, and the husband's desire to spend time with his daughter. If the husband is pushing despite her valid concerns and not addressing her fears, he might be in the wrong. However, if he's trying to assert his parental rights and she's being overly restrictive without just cause, maybe not. But given the context of her medical history and current state, her fears might be legitimate. The husband might not be in the wrong for wanting to spend time with his daughter, but he might be in the wrong if he's not addressing her concerns or if he's being dismissive of her anxiety. However, the situation seems more like a clash between parental responsibilities and the wife's health/mental state, so maybe the answer is that the husband isn't in the wrong, but the wife's fears are valid. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since he's trying to take the daughter with a support system in place, but the wife is denying him due to her own fears, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
