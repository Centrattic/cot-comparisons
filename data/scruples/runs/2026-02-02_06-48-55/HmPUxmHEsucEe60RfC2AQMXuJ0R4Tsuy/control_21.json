I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife not allowing the husband to take their daughter on a ski trip. The husband feels he's being restricted from spending time with his daughter, especially since the parents and brother are available to help. The wife has a history of not trusting the husband with the daughter, and now with her pregnancy and a past miscarriage, she's more anxious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband wants to spend time with his daughter, which is understandable. He mentions he's tried being alone with her before, and there's been no harm. The wife's trust issues might stem from past experiences or her current stress due to pregnancy. Her fear of another miscarriage could be making her more overprotective. \n\nThe key points are: the wife's lack of trust in the husband and his parents, the husband's desire for quality time with his daughter, and the wife's anxiety due to pregnancy. The husband is frustrated because the parents are willing to help, but the wife isn't trusting them. The daughter is almost 5, so maybe she's old enough for the husband to take her, but the wife's concerns about safety or stress from the trip could play a role.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, the wife's feelings are valid, especially given her pregnancy and past trauma. The husband might be pushing too hard without considering her emotional state. On the other hand, the wife's refusal seems extreme if there's no evidence of harm. But since the wife is pregnant and the stress could affect her health, maybe the husband needs to be more empathetic and find a middle ground. However, the wife isn't listening, and the husband feels cornered. \n\nI think the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the husband is trying to spend time with his child, and the wife's lack of trust isn't justified by any real harm. But I need to check if the husband is dismissing her valid concerns. The wife's anxiety from the past miscarriage is a factor. The husband might need to validate her fears while asserting his need to be involved. However, the question is about who is \"in the wrong.\" Since the wife is the one denying him based on her distrust, maybe the husband isn't wrong here. But maybe he should be more considerate of her current state. Hmm. It's a balance. The wife's actions are causing conflict, but the husband's persistence could be seen as ignoring her valid emotional needs. I'm leaning toward B but not entirely sure.\n"
