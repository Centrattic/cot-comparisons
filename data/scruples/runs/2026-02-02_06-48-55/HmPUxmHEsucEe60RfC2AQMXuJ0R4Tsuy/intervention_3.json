I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a father who wants to take his almost 5-year-old daughter skiing, but his pregnant wife refuses to let him go. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is now pregnant again. The author feels that he's being denied time with his daughter, especially since his parents and brother are available to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant and has had a previous miscarriage. Her anxiety about the pregnancy is understandable. She might be worried that being separated from the child could cause stress, which she believes might lead to another miscarriage. The fact that she's been nervous about the author being alone with the daughter in the past adds to her current anxiety. She doesn't trust the author or his parents with the daughter, which is a significant point.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels he's being unfair to his wife by not taking the daughter. He mentions that he's never hurt the daughter, just had some bruises from energetic play, which he thinks is part of being a father. He's also planning to have his parents and brother nearby, which could provide support. The author is frustrated because he's been fighting with his wife repeatedly about this, and she's not listening to his arguments.\n\nLooking at the dynamics, the wife's health and emotional state are critical. Pregnancy after a miscarriage can be very stressful. The wife's refusal might be more about her own mental health and fear than the actual safety of the daughter. The author might not be considering how his insistence affects her stress levels. Even if the author's intentions are good, pushing for the trip could exacerbate her anxiety, which isn't healthy for her or the pregnancy.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is respecting his wife's valid concerns. If she genuinely believes that being separated from their daughter could harm her pregnancy, the author needs to prioritize her health. The author's desire to bond with the daughter is important, but it shouldn't come at the cost of his wife's well-being. The fact that they're in constant fights shows a communication breakdown. The author might need to find a middle ground, like having the daughter with him but ensuring the wife feels supported, or perhaps adjusting the trip to include her if possible.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong not because of the trip itself but because he's not adequately addressing his wife's fears and stress, which could have serious consequences. It's about balancing the needs of the family and considering the wife's health during a vulnerable time.\n"
