I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a pregnant wife refusing to let her husband take their daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and brother. The husband feels he's being unfairly denied, especially since he's been allowed some time with the daughter before. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is now very anxious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is pregnant, which can cause anxiety, especially after a previous miscarriage. She might be more cautious and worried about stress affecting her current pregnancy. The husband feels he's being trusted with the daughter before and that the parents and brother are reliable. He also mentions he's never hurt the daughter, just plays energetically as a father. \n\nThe wife's refusal could stem from her fear and past trauma. Her anxiety is high, and maybe she's not able to trust him to take the daughter even with the parents there. The husband might not realize how his actions are increasing her stress, even if he's not intentionally trying to. The fact that he's had 20 fights on the same topic shows a breakdown in communication. He might not be considering her emotional state enough, pushing for his needs while she's vulnerable.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to fulfill his role as a father, wanting to bond with his daughter in a fun way. He has support from his parents and extended family. But maybe he's not acknowledging her valid concerns and is being too persistent, which could be harmful to her mental health during pregnancy.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's not respecting her anxiety and forcing the issue, that's a problem. Even if he's been allowed to take the daughter before, the wife's current situation is different. She's more fragile, and his insistence might be exacerbating her stress, which could have medical implications. The key points are her pregnancy, past miscarriage, and her expressed fear that this could happen again. He needs to prioritize her well-being here, even if it means giving up his plans temporarily. His actions, while coming from a place of wanting to spend time with the daughter, might be neglecting her emotional needs. So, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he's not considering her valid fears and is causing her additional stress, which isn't helpful during her pregnancy.\n"
