I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a father, wants to take his daughter on a skiing trip, but his pregnant wife won't allow it. The wife is worried about the daughter's safety, especially since she's been very controlling about who cares for the child. The author feels it's reasonable since his parents and brother are also going to be there, and he's never hurt the daughter. But the wife is pregnant, had a miscarriage before, and this is making her stressed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant, which is a vulnerable time, and she's worried about the daughter's safety. The fact that she had a miscarriage adds to her anxiety. She might be overprotective, but her reasons are rooted in stress and past trauma. The author's wife has been cautious about leaving the daughter with him alone for a long time, only allowing it for short periods. Now, he wants to take her on a skiing trip, which is a new and potentially risky activity. Even if he plays energetically, skiing itself could be a concern, especially for a five-year-old.\n\nThe author, on the other hand, feels he's being denied a bonding experience with his daughter. He mentions he's never injured her and wants to engage in active play, which is typical for a father. He's also frustrated that his wife doesn't trust him or his parents, even though they've been approved before. But since the wife is pregnant, her mental health and stress levels are important too. The author's repeated fights might be exacerbating her stress, which could affect her pregnancy.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's anxiety due to her pregnancy and past miscarriage, the father's desire for quality time with the daughter, and the lack of trust from the wife regarding his ability to care for the daughter during the trip. The author might not be in the wrong because he has a legitimate desire to bond with his child, but he also needs to consider his wife's emotional state. However, the wife's concerns are valid given her history and current condition. The author might not be considering how his insistence affects her stress levels, which is important during pregnancy. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not fully understanding his wife's feelings, leading to repeated arguments that could harm her well-being. Alternatively, the wife's trust issues might be unreasonable, but they are influenced by her anxiety. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the wife's justified stress and his not addressing her fears adequately.\n"
