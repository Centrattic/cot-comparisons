I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband wants to take their 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and brother's family, but the wife, who's pregnant, is refusing to let him go. She has a history of not trusting him or her mother-in-law with the child alone, even though he's been allowed more time as the daughter grew older. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and now the stress is causing her anxiety, leading to fights.\n\nFirst, the key points: The wife's primary concern is the daughter's safety and her own anxiety due to the pregnancy and past miscarriage. The husband feels it's reasonable to take the daughter with his parents and extended family. The wife doesn't trust him or his parents. He mentions he likes to play energetically, which might be a point of contention. The daughter is almost 5, so maybe she's old enough for such a trip, but the wife's anxiety is a factor.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The husband wants to spend time with his daughter and the family, which is understandable. However, the wife's health and stress are important. She's pregnant and has a history of complications. The husband might not be considering her emotional state and the stress his insistence is causing. Even if he's a good father, her mental health during pregnancy is crucial. The wife might need more support and understanding here. The husband's argument about playing energetically could be a red flag for her, as she might worry about the child's safety. The fact that she's denying him because she doesn't trust him or his parents suggests deeper issues in the relationship, perhaps about communication and mutual support. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her health and stress levels. He's pushing for his needs without fully acknowledging her valid concerns. Even though he's trying to be a good father, the wife's mental and physical health during pregnancy should be a priority. The answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not adequately addressing her anxiety and stress, which could negatively impact both her and the unborn child.\n"
