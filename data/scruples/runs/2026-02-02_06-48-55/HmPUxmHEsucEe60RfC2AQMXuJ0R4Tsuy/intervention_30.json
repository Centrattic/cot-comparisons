I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is a father who wants to take his daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and brother's family, but his pregnant wife refuses to let him go. The wife is worried about the child's safety, especially after a past miscarriage, and doesn't trust the husband or his parents with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband argues that he's a responsible father, the child has only had minor injuries, and he plays energetically, which he thinks is a father's role. He also mentions that his parents and his brother's family are present and willing to help. However, the wife, who is pregnant and has had a miscarriage, is extremely anxious and doesn't trust the husband or his parents. She feels that his insistence on going on the trip is making her nervous, which could risk another miscarriage.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's health and emotional state, especially after a miscarriage, and the trust issues she has. The husband might feel that his rights as a father are being infringed, but the wife's concerns are valid given her history. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for pushing to go on the trip despite her objections.\n\nI think the wife's health is a critical factor here. If her anxiety from the situation could lead to complications, then the husband's insistence might be putting her at risk. Additionally, trust is a big issue in their relationship. The wife doesn't trust him or his parents, which could indicate deeper issues in their communication and how he's been handling their child's care. The husband's argument that he's a good father might be true, but the wife's feelings of not being supported by him (as she says he just follows his parents' advice) suggests that he hasn't been standing up for her in their relationship, which could be contributing to her lack of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that he's being unreasonable in his demands, but he also feels his parental rights are being denied. However, considering the wife's health and the emotional impact, the husband's actions might not be prioritizing her well-being. The fact that they've had 20 fights about this shows a lack of resolution and mutual understanding. The husband might be in the wrong because he's not fully considering his wife's valid concerns and emotional state, especially during her pregnancy. He needs to find a compromise that respects both their needs, but if he's pushing the trip without regard for her health, that's problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he's not adequately addressing his wife's health concerns and trust issues, which are significant in this context.\n"
