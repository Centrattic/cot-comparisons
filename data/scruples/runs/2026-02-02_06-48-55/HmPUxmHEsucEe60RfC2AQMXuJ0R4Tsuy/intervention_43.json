I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband planning a skiing trip with his daughter while his pregnant wife refuses to let him go. The wife is worried about the daughter's safety and her own health due to a past miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband feels he's being denied time with his daughter, especially since he's not been allowed to be alone with her much before. He mentions that even with his parents and brother nearby, the wife doesn't trust him. The wife, on the other hand, has a history of a miscarriage and is currently pregnant again. Her anxiety is causing her to be more protective, which is understandable given her past experience. She's also worried that the husband's energetic play could be a risk, even though the daughter only has minor injuries.\n\nThe husband plays energetic games with his daughter, which the wife might see as a potential risk. The wife's trust in him might be low because of past control issues, like not allowing him to spend time alone with the child. Also, the husband's arguments might not be addressing her emotional concerns enough. He's focusing on his right to spend time with the daughter, but maybe not validating her fears enough as a pregnant woman with a history of miscarriage.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he's not respecting her feelings and the risks she's aware of, maybe. But he's also trying to connect with his daughter. However, the key here is that the wife's anxiety is linked to her health and past trauma. The husband might be pushing too hard without considering her emotional state and medical history. The fact that she's pregnant and had a miscarriage adds weight to her concerns. Even if the husband's intentions are good, forcing the issue might not be supportive of her needs right now.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions that his wife says he just follows his parents' advice and doesn't stand up for her. That suggests communication issues in the marriage, where he might not be addressing her feelings adequately. Maybe he's not negotiating or finding a middle ground that respects both their needs. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have valid points, but the wife's health and the child's safety during her pregnancy should be a priority. The husband needs to consider her perspective more, especially given her history. So, the answer might be that the husband is in the wrong because he's not adequately addressing his wife's valid concerns, which are compounded by her current vulnerable state.\n"
