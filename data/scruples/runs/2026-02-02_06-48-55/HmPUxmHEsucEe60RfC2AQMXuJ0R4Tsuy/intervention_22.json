I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a dad who wants to take his almost 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and brother's family. But his pregnant wife is refusing to let him go, and she doesn't trust him or his parents to take care of the daughter. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is worried that the stress from the fight is making her pregnant again risky.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is saying that his wife never allowed him to be alone with their daughter for long periods, even when the daughter was younger. Now that the daughter is 5, he thinks it's reasonable to take her on a trip with his parents there. He mentions that his wife is pregnant, so she's not going, but he's being denied the trip. The wife's concern is that she doesn't trust him or his parents with their daughter, and she's worried about her own health due to the previous miscarriage.\n\nThe author feels he's being unfair because he's never injured the daughter, just a bruise once, and he plays a bit energetic as a dad. He wants to go skiing and is frustrated that his wife isn't allowing it. But the wife's side is that she's pregnant, anxious about another possible miscarriage, and doesn't trust the author to handle the daughter properly without her supervision. She might feel that his actions are not supporting her during this vulnerable time.\n\nHmm, the key points here are trust, the wife's mental and physical health, and the daughter's safety. The author might be trying to assert his role as a father, but the wife's refusal could be rooted in her past trauma (miscarriage) and current pregnancy stress. If the wife has a history of not trusting the author with their daughter, then her current decision might be a protective measure. However, the author might feel that he's been responsible and wants to bond with his daughter, which is important.\n\nBut then, if the wife is pregnant and has a history of complications, her well-being is also crucial. The author's repeated arguments might be causing her stress, which she's linking to her health risks. The author might be in the wrong if his insistence on going on the trip is disregarding her health concerns and the trust issues she has. On the other hand, if he's been responsible and the wife's trust is unfounded, maybe she's being overprotective.\n\nI think the main issue is the wife's lack of trust and her anxiety. If the author has a history of being unable to handle the daughter alone, maybe the wife's concerns are valid. Even if he hasn't hurt the child, her trust in him is low. So, the author's insistence on going might be pushing against her boundaries, especially when she's in a fragile state. Therefore, maybe he is in the wrong because he's not considering her feelings and health, and the trust issues need to be addressed instead of forcing the situation. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
