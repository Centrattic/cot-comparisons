I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a husband wanting to take their daughter on a skiing trip while the wife is pregnant. The wife, who previously didn't trust the husband to be alone with their daughter, is now refusing to let him go, fearing another miscarriage due to stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She had a miscarriage a year ago and is now pregnant again. Her anxiety about her health and the pregnancy is valid. The husband's desire to take their daughter on a trip might be seen as dismissive of her fears, especially since she's been stressed by their ongoing arguments about this. The wife's trust issues with him and his parents being the only ones allowed to care for the daughter add another layer. Even though the husband has a history of being allowed to spend time with their daughter, the wife's current state is more fragile.\n\nOn the husband's side, he feels he's being unfairly restricted. He mentions he's a good father, with the daughter only having minor injuries. He also wants to spend quality time with her, which is a natural parental desire. His parents and brother are willing to help, which could be a solution, but the wife doesn't trust them. The husband's frustration is understandable, but repeatedly fighting with a pregnant wife who has a history of miscarriage might not be the best approach.\n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and compromise. The wife needs to feel supported, especially given her medical history. The husband needs to respect her anxiety and find alternative ways to spend time with their daughter without causing her stress. The fact that this is the 20th fight about the same issue suggests a lack of resolution and possibly a pattern of not addressing her concerns adequately. \n\nSo, while both have valid points, the husband's insistence on going despite the wife's health and emotional state might make him at fault. It's important to prioritize her well-being during pregnancy, especially after a previous loss. The answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong) because he's not considering her health and stress levels, which are crucial in her current condition.\n"
