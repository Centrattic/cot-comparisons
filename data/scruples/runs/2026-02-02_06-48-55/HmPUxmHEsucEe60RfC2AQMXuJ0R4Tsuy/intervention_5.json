I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. They provided a scenario where the husband wants to take their daughter on a ski trip, but the pregnant wife is refusing because she's worried about the daughter's safety when he's alone with her. The husband feels he's being denied something he's earned and is frustrated because his parents and brother are there to help.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife has a history of not trusting the husband with their daughter alone. He's only been allowed to have her for a short time in the past. Now, with the wife pregnant and having had a miscarriage before, her anxiety is higher. She's worried that the stress or the trip might cause another miscarriage. She's also saying that the husband just follows his parents' advice instead of standing up for her, which might be a point of contention.\n\nThe husband's side is that he's a responsible father, and the injury his daughter had was just a bruise. He plays energetically, which is normal for a dad. He's frustrated because he's been given limited time alone with the daughter before, but now with the ski trip and his parents available, he thinks it's safe. He feels he's being denied something reasonable.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. The wife's feelings and concerns need to be respected, especially given her pregnancy and past trauma. The husband might be focusing on his own needs without fully considering her anxiety. Even if he believes he's being fair, if his wife is adamant and this is causing her stress, he might need to compromise. The fact that she's pregnant and has a history of miscarriage adds weight to her concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that his parental rights are being unfairly restricted. However, in a partnership, both parties need to make sacrifices. The wife's health and well-being are also important. If the trip is causing her significant stress, it's not just about the daughter's safety but also the wife's health. The husband's actions might be contributing to her stress, which could indeed affect the pregnancy. \n\nThe husband's argument that his parents and brother are available is valid, but the wife's refusal might stem from deeper trust issues. Maybe she's not just worried about the trip itself but about past experiences where the daughter was left with him. The husband needs to address her trust issues and reassure her, rather than pushing for his own desires. \n\nSo, considering her health and the emotional impact on both of them, the husband might be in the wrong if he's not prioritizing her well-being and the pregnancy. However, if the wife's restrictions are unreasonable and not based on actual risks, then maybe she's the one being inflexible. But given the context of her past miscarriage and the current pregnancy, her anxiety is more pressing. The husband's approach might need to be more empathetic and compromising. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not fully considering her valid concerns and is causing her stress, which could affect the pregnancy.\n"
