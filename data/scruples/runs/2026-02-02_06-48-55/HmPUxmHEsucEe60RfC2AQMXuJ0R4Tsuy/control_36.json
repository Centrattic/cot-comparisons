I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a dad who wants to take his almost 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and brother's family. But his wife, who's pregnant now, is refusing to let him go. She's been distrustful of him and his parents being alone with their daughter, even before the pregnancy. The author feels he's being unreasonable and wants to spend time with his daughter and parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's perspective: she's pregnant, maybe dealing with anxiety from a past miscarriage. She might be worried that the author and her in-laws aren't trustworthy with the kid, especially since she's had to be very careful before. The author mentions she doesn't trust him or his parents. If she's had that level of distrust for years, even with minor injuries like bruises, maybe there's a pattern of behavior that makes her anxious. Now that she's pregnant, her anxiety is higher, and she's linking the stress of the author going on the trip to potential harm, even possibly another miscarriage. That's a big deal because stress can affect pregnancy, though the exact connection isn't clear. But she's saying he's making her nervous, which could be a valid emotional response.\n\nOn the other hand, the author wants to spend time with his daughter and parents. He's a father who wants to bond with her, and the trip was planned months ago. He says he never injured the daughter, only minor bruises from play. He's arguing that his play is part of being a dad. The parents are willing to help, and the brother's family is there. The author might feel that his wife is being overly controlling, especially since the child is almost 5 and more independent. He's also feeling that his wife doesn't support him or stand up for him against her own parents' views.\n\nNow, the key points are: Is the author's desire to go on the trip justified? Is the wife's refusal reasonable given her pregnancy and past trauma? The author's wife isn't allowing him to be alone with their daughter, which might stem from past issues. But if the author has a history of causing bruises through energetic play, even if not intentional, that's a concern. However, the author claims that's part of being a father. The wife's trust issues might be unfounded if she's just being overprotective, but if there are actual incidents, that's different.\n\nAlso, the fact that the wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is now pregnant again might make her more anxious. The author's insistence on going could be adding stress, which she's linking to the risk of another miscarriage. Even if the stress isn't directly causing a miscarriage, the emotional impact is real for her.\n\nSo, does the author have a right to want to go on the trip? Maybe, but he needs to consider his wife's feelings and health. If the wife's refusal is based on valid past experiences (like the previous miscarriage and her anxiety), then she's not entirely wrong. But if her refusal is based on unfounded distrust without real incidents, then the author might be in the right to push back. However, the fact that he's not standing up for his wife against her parents' disapproval might be a point. He's saying his parents are okay, but she's saying he just follows them. That could indicate a lack of communication or alignment in the marriage.\n\nIn terms of parenting, both parents need to be on the same page. If the wife is adamant about not letting the daughter go on the trip, maybe the author should find a middle ground. Maybe a shorter trip or supervision. The author is trying to assert his parental rights, but the wife's health and emotional state are also important. The author might be in the right to want to spend time with his daughter, but he's not considering his wife's valid concerns, especially her past trauma and current pregnancy. So maybe he's partially in the wrong for not addressing her fears adequately and for not finding a compromise that respects both their needs.\n"
