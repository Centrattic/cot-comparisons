I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong given the situation with their pregnant wife and the skiing trip. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the wife has been very protective of their daughter, not allowing the husband to take her alone except for short periods. The daughter is almost 5, and the husband wants to take her skiing with family support. The wife got pregnant, which might be adding to her anxiety, especially since she had a miscarriage before. She's denying the husband going, possibly due to trust issues. The husband feels he's being reasonable, wants to bond with his daughter, and plays energetically, which he thinks is a father's role. The wife is worried about the trip causing her stress, which could affect her pregnancy.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's being denied time with his daughter, and he's been responsible with her. The wife's side is that she's pregnant, has a history of miscarriage, and doesn't trust the husband or his parents to take care of their daughter properly. Trust is a big issue here. The wife's anxiety might be valid given her past and current state. The husband might be pushing for his desires without fully considering her fears. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? He wants to spend time with their daughter, which is understandable. But maybe he's not respecting his wife's feelings enough. The wife's trust issues need to be addressed. The husband's energetic play could be a point\u2014maybe the wife feels that's risky? Also, the fact that he had a fight 20 times suggests that he might not be compromising. Being in the wrong might depend on whether he's considering her emotional state and past trauma. If the husband is dismissive of her fears, even if they seem irrational, he could be in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's trying to balance his needs and hers, but not getting through to her, maybe not. But given her history and current pregnancy, his actions could be adding stress, which might make him at fault. So leaning towards A, he's in the wrong because he's not adequately addressing her concerns and history.\n"
