I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where his pregnant wife is refusing to let him take their daughter on a ski trip. The author feels frustrated because his wife doesn't trust him or his parents with their daughter, even though he hasn't caused any serious injuries. He also mentions that his wife had a miscarriage a year ago, which is making the current pregnancy stressful for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant and has a history of a miscarriage, which might make her more anxious. Her anxiety could be exacerbated by arguments with her husband over childcare. The wife's refusal to let him go on the trip might stem from her fear of something happening if the daughter is in his care, especially since she's already been reluctant to leave the daughter with him for long periods before the pregnancy.\n\nThe author is trying to assert his role as a father, wanting to spend time with his daughter, which is valid. However, the wife's safety concerns, especially during a high-risk pregnancy, need to be addressed. The fact that they're having repeated fights (20th time) suggests that communication might be a bigger issue here. The wife feels unheard and unsupported, which is a legitimate problem. \n\nThe author mentions that the trip was planned months ago, but now the wife's pregnancy changes the situation. The wife might be overwhelmed by the new pregnancy and the fear of another loss, making her more protective. The author's argument that his parents and brother's family can help might not alleviate her fears if she doesn't trust them either. \n\nThe key points here are the wife's anxiety due to her current health situation and the history of the miscarriage. The husband's desire to bond with his daughter is important, but it's crucial to respect his wife's emotional state. The author might not be in the wrong in wanting to spend time with his daughter, but he might be overlooking his wife's valid concerns and emotional needs. The problem seems to be more about communication and mutual support rather than a clear right or wrong. The wife's trust issues might need addressing through open dialogue and professional help if necessary, but given the current context, the author's actions, while understandable, might not consider his wife's heightened stress and anxiety adequately.\n"
