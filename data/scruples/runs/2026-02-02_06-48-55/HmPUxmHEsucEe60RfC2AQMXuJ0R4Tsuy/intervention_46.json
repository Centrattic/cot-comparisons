I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a husband wanting to take his daughter on a skiing trip without his pregnant wife, but she refuses. The wife has a history of not allowing the husband alone with their daughter, even when she was younger. Now that she's pregnant, especially after a previous miscarriage, she's more anxious and doesn't trust the husband or his parents to watch the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband feels he's being denied time with his daughter, especially since he has family support. He mentions that the only times he's been allowed to have the child are limited, and now with the trip planned, he wants to take advantage of that. The wife, on the other hand, is dealing with pregnancy and past trauma (the miscarriage), which makes her nervous. Her refusal could stem from fear of another loss, perhaps triggered by stress from arguing or not being able to control the situation.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he's a responsible parent, with the kid having only minor injuries. He plays energetically, which he sees as a father's role. The wife's distrust might be affecting their relationship, especially since she says he just follows his parents' advice and doesn't support her. The key here is the wife's mental health and the husband's responsibility to consider that.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife's anxiety is valid, especially given her history. The husband might not be seeing how his insistence could be stressing her, even if he's not intentionally doing so. The question is whether he's in the wrong by pushing for the trip despite her valid concerns. It's about balancing parental responsibilities and mutual support. The author is asking if he's the asshole for not backing down, considering her pregnancy and past issues. So, maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because he's not prioritizing his wife's mental health and well-being during a vulnerable time, even if his intentions are good.\n"
