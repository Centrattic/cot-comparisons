I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a dad, wants to take his almost 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip, but his wife, who is pregnant, won't let him. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is now really nervous about her current pregnancy. She's worried that the author being away with the daughter might trigger another miscarriage because she's stressed. The author feels that the wife doesn't trust him, even though he's been allowed to take the daughter for short periods before. He likes to play energetic with the kid, which the wife doesn't like.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the wife's health and their daughter's well-being. The wife is pregnant and has a history of miscarriage. Her anxiety is valid given her medical history. The author wants to spend time with his daughter, which is understandable, especially with family support (parents and brother nearby). But the wife's main concern is her own health and the pregnancy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to assert his parental role, but the wife's concerns are about her own and the unborn child's health. The wife might feel that the stress of the author being away with the daughter could affect her pregnancy. The author mentions they've had 20 fights, which suggests that this is a recurring issue. The author also says he does what his parents tell him, which might imply he's not standing up for his own decisions, but that's more about their communication issues.\n\nSo, the author's actions (wanting to take the daughter skiing) might seem reasonable, but the wife's refusal is based on her health condition and anxiety. The author is in a tough spot, but maybe he's not considering her medical history enough. However, the wife's denial could be overly cautious. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's pushing to go skiing despite her valid medical concerns, then maybe he is. On the other hand, if he's just trying to bond with his daughter and the wife isn't allowing it without a good reason, he might not be. The answer hinges on whose concerns are more valid. Since the wife has a real medical history, her refusal might be justified, making the author at fault for not respecting her concerns. But the author might be in the right if the wife is being overly restrictive. \n\nWait, the author mentions that the wife doesn't trust him or his parents with the daughter, but he's had her for up to 4 hours before. That might not be enough time for a full ski trip. However, the presence of the parents and brother might be a good support system. But the wife is still refusing. The author is trying to go, but the wife's health is the main issue. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's following his parents' advice, but the wife's refusal is about her health. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's current health situation, even if it's about their child. If she's pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, her stress levels could indeed affect the pregnancy. So, the author's desire to take the daughter skiing might be causing unnecessary stress, which could be seen as him not prioritizing his wife's health. \n\nBut then again, the author is also a parent and wants to spend time with his child. It's a balance. Since the author is the one asking if he's in the wrong, and the wife's refusal is based on her health, maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong, but the wife is being overprotective. However, considering her medical history, her refusal is a valid concern. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's trying to spend time with his daughter, and the support from family is there. The wife's denial is due to her health concerns, but the author isn't violating any major trust issues. However, the wife's denial might be unreasonable, but the author isn't the one making her anxious; her own anxiety is causing the issue. So the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
