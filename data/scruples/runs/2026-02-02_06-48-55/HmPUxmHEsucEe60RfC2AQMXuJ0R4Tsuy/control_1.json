I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a father wanting to take his daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and siblings, but the wife, who's pregnant, is refusing to let him go because she doesn't trust him or his parents with the daughter. They've had previous issues where the wife didn't allow him alone time with the daughter. Now, with her pregnancy and a history of miscarriage, she's getting more anxious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The father argues that he's never harmed the child, only had minor bruises, and that he wants to be playful. The wife is pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, which is making her more anxious. She might feel that any stress could lead to another miscarriage. Also, she's been controlling who can take care of their daughter, only allowing his mother-in-law and kindergarten, which might indicate trust issues or past experiences affecting her current decisions.\n\nThe father is frustrated because he's been denied alone time with his daughter before and now wants to spend time with her during the ski trip. His parents and brother are willing to help, but the wife doesn't trust them. The father feels he's not advocating enough for himself, as his wife says he follows his parents' advice too much. He's in a tough spot between his parental desires and his wife's anxiety.\n\nIs the father in the wrong? Well, it's a family matter, but the wife's health and the pregnancy are important. If her stress from the husband not being able to go on the trip could risk another miscarriage, maybe the husband should prioritize her health. However, the husband also has a right to spend time with his daughter. But given the circumstances\u2014pregnancy, history of miscarriage, and her current anxiety\u2014it's possible the wife's concerns are valid. The husband might need to understand her perspective and find a compromise, maybe adjusting the trip or including her in the planning if possible. However, the key point is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to do what he believes is right for his daughter and his family, but the wife's health is a critical factor, maybe the answer leans towards the husband not being in the wrong, but there's a lot of nuance here. The wife's trust issues and anxiety are significant. But the husband's actions (playing energetic, previous denials of alone time) might contribute to her lack of trust. So maybe the husband is in the wrong for not addressing the underlying trust issues or understanding her anxiety. Hmm. Alternatively, since the husband is trying to spend time with his daughter and isn't harming her, maybe he's not in the wrong. I think the answer is B, but I'm a bit torn because of the wife's health. But the question is specifically about the husband's actions in denying him the trip. The wife's refusal might be the main issue, but the husband's role in building trust could be a factor. I'll go with B, No.\n"
