I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnant wife who won't let the husband take their daughter on a skiing trip. The wife has a history of not trusting the husband to be alone with their daughter. The husband feels he's being unfair, especially with his parents and brother's kids there to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She had a miscarriage a year ago and is now pregnant again. Her anxiety might be heightened, which is common in such situations. She might be more cautious and worried about the daughter's safety. The fact that she doesn't trust the husband or his parents with her daughter raises questions about past experiences. The husband mentions never injuring the daughter, but maybe the wife has other concerns, like the husband's energetic playstyle. Even if the injury history is minor, trust issues can be significant, especially after a traumatic event like a miscarriage.\n\nThe husband wants to go skiing with the daughter, but the wife is denying it. He's frustrated because he feels he's not being given the chance to bond with the daughter during the trip. However, the wife's refusal could be rooted in her anxiety and past trauma. The husband's repeated fights might be adding stress to her pregnancy, which is a valid concern. He also mentions doing what his parents say, which might indicate a lack of assertiveness in standing up for his own needs or the daughter's.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to spend quality time with the daughter, which is important. The ski trip was planned months ago, so the change in plans might be frustrating. However, the wife's primary concern is the daughter's safety and her own health. The key here is whether the husband is overstepping by pushing for the trip despite the wife's clear reservations. If the wife's refusal is based on valid safety concerns, especially given her medical history, the husband might need to respect that, even if it's hard for him.\n\nI should also consider communication. The husband and wife have had 20 fights over this, which suggests a breakdown in communication. The husband might not be addressing the wife's fears effectively, and she might not be feeling heard. The husband's argument about playing energetically could be a point of contention if the wife feels that's too risky. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is trying to bond with the daughter, which is healthy, but the wife's anxiety could be a legitimate medical concern. The question is whether the husband is being inconsiderate by not backing down. If the wife's doctor has advised her to avoid stress for the pregnancy, the husband's insistence might be harmful.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the wife's health and the daughter's safety are paramount, but the husband's need for quality time is also valid. The answer hinges on whether the husband is disregarding the wife's health concerns for his own desires. If the wife's refusal is medically justified and the husband is pushing despite this, he might be in the right. But if the wife's fears are unfounded or exaggerated, he might not be. Given the context, the wife's past miscarriage and current pregnancy stress make her concerns more valid, so the husband should prioritize her health and the daughter's safety. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision.\n"
