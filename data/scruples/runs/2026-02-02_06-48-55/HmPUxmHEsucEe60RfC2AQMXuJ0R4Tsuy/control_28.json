I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a father who wants to take his 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip. The wife just got pregnant and is refusing to go. The main conflict is that the wife doesn't want the author or his parents to be alone with the daughter for extended periods. The author feels trusted and wants to spend time with his daughter, especially since there will be other family members present. The wife is anxious, possibly due to a past miscarriage, and fears that the author's actions might cause stress leading to another miscarriage. They've had multiple fights about this, and the wife feels the author isn't supporting her enough.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? On one hand, he's advocating for his parental rights and wants to bond with his daughter. He mentions that the biggest injury the daughter had was a bruise, implying he's generally careful. The presence of grandparents and other family might provide support. On the other hand, the wife is in a vulnerable state, having been through a miscarriage, and her anxiety is likely justified. The author's energetic play might be a point of contention for her, even if he means well. The wife's refusal could stem from fear for the child's safety and her own health.\n\nBut does the author have a valid point? He's trying to maintain a relationship with his daughter, which is important. However, the wife's health and emotional state during pregnancy are critical. The author might not be considering how his insistence affects her stress levels. The question is whether his actions are reasonable given her current condition. If the wife is genuinely worried that the trip could lead to another miscarriage, and the author is pushing despite her concerns, that could make him at fault for not prioritizing her well-being. Alternatively, if the wife is being overly controlling and not trusting him as a parent, maybe she's the one in the wrong.\n\nBut in AITA scenarios, it's often about empathy and considering the other person's perspective. The wife's past trauma (miscarriage) and current pregnancy likely make her more anxious. The author needs to balance his desire to spend time with his daughter with his wife's health. If he's dismissing her fears and the potential risks to her pregnancy, that's probably where he's going wrong. Even if he's a good parent, not respecting his wife's medical concerns and emotional state could be seen as his fault. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not adequately addressing his wife's valid concerns during her pregnancy.\n"
