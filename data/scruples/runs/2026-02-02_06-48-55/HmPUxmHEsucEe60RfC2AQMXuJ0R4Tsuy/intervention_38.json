I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their pregnant wife won't let them take their daughter on a skiing trip. The author wants to go, and their parents and brother are there to help, but the wife doesn't trust them.\n\nFirst, the wife's perspective: She's pregnant again after a miscarriage, so she's probably anxious. She might be worried about both her own health and the daughter's safety. The fact that she's been nervous about leaving the daughter with the author before is a key point. The author mentions the wife doesn't trust him or his parents, which is a big issue here. Even if the author hasn't hurt the daughter, the perception of risk matters, especially when the wife is already stressed from her pregnancy.\n\nThe author's side: He's trying to spend time with his daughter, which is important for bonding. He mentions playing energetically, which might be a point of contention. The wife might see that as a risk, even if it's normal play. Also, the author is frustrated by repeated arguments, which is understandable, but he needs to consider his wife's feelings and health during pregnancy.\n\nCommunication is a big factor. The author says the wife doesn't think he stands up for her, implying he might be too influenced by his parents. Maybe he hasn't effectively communicated his own needs without dismissing her concerns. The wife's anxiety is compounded by the pregnancy, so their usual conflicts are heightened.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible he's not malicious, but he's not considering his wife's emotional state and her justified fears. He might be pushing too hard for his own desires without acknowledging her perspective. The answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because the focus should be on the wife's needs during pregnancy and resolving the trust issues. However, it's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. But given the context of the wife's health and safety concerns, the author might need to back off and find a middle ground instead of insisting on taking the daughter.\n"
