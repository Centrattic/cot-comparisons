I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants to take their daughter on a ski trip, but the pregnant wife won't let him. The daughter is almost 5, and the wife is pregnant again. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago, and she's worried that the stress from the husband's insistence might cause another one. The husband feels he's being prevented from bonding with their daughter and is frustrated because his parents and brother are available to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband argues that he's a responsible father, only had a minor injury with the daughter, and wants to have energetic playtime. He's also planning a trip with family support. On the other hand, the wife is pregnant, dealing with past trauma from a miscarriage, and her trust in the husband and his parents is low. She's under stress, which could affect her pregnancy.\n\nThe key points here are trust and the wife's health. The wife's refusal might stem from her fear of losing another child, especially after a previous miscarriage. Her stress could be legitimate and valid, given her history. The husband, however, might not be considering how his insistence is affecting her mental and physical health. Even if the husband is a good father, the wife's feelings and medical history are important factors here.\n\nThe husband mentions that they've had 20 fights about this, which is a lot. That suggests that the wife's concerns aren't being addressed or respected by him. He might be prioritizing his own desire to be with the daughter over her emotional and physical well-being. Even if the parents can help, the wife's lack of trust in them complicates things. Maybe he should focus on reassuring her and finding a solution that makes her comfortable, rather than pushing for the trip.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents need to work together for the child's and each other's well-being. If the husband is causing unnecessary stress to his wife, especially during pregnancy, that could be harmful. The wife's trust issues might need to be addressed through communication or counseling, but the husband's role here is to support her, not force his way through.\n\nSo, considering all that, it seems like the husband might be in the wrong because he's not prioritizing his wife's health and feelings, which are crucial during pregnancy, especially with a history of miscarriage. His insistence could be contributing to her stress, which he's not acknowledging. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
