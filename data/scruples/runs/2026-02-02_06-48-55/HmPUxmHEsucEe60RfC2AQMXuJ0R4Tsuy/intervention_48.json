I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a dad who wants to take his almost 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip, but his pregnant wife is refusing to let him go. She doesn't trust him or his parents to take care of the kid. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is worried it might happen again because of the stress from their arguments.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his wife never liked leaving him alone with their daughter. When the daughter was 2, he could only stay with her for half an hour. At 3, he got up to 4 hours. Now the daughter is 5, and the trip was planned months ago. The wife is pregnant and doesn't want to go skiing, so she's blocking him from going. He has his parents and brother's family there to help, but she doesn't trust them either. He argues that he's never hurt the daughter, just a bruise once, and he plays energetic, which he thinks is part of being a dad.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about trust and the wife's concerns. The wife's past experience with a miscarriage and her current pregnancy make her more anxious. She's worried the stress from arguments might trigger another miscarriage. That's a valid medical concern. The author is trying to go on a trip, but the wife feels he's not standing up for her and is too influenced by his parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is almost 5, and the author is asking to take her on a trip with his parents and in-laws nearby. He doesn't have a history of serious injuries. But the wife has consistently not trusted him with the kid alone. So maybe her lack of trust is based on past experiences, not just being controlling. If she's never allowed him to have extended time with the daughter before, then suddenly allowing it now might be a red flag for her.\n\nBut the author is frustrated that his wife isn't trusting him now, especially with the support from his parents and brother. He feels he's being too accommodating to his parents instead of fighting for his wife. The wife feels he's not standing up for her, which adds to the tension. \n\nI think the issue here is about the wife's anxiety due to her pregnancy and past trauma. Her refusal might be more about her own stress rather than the child's safety, but the author isn't addressing her emotional needs. He's focusing on his right to take the daughter, but maybe he should be more empathetic to her situation. If he's arguing 20 times about it, that's causing stress, which she's afraid might lead to another miscarriage. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not considering how his actions and the conflict are affecting his wife's health. He should be trying to find a compromise that respects her feelings while still allowing him to have some time with his daughter. Alternatively, maybe the wife is being too controlling, but given her history, her fears might be legitimate. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because he's not addressing her emotional well-being adequately.\n"
