I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to take his daughter on a ski trip while his pregnant wife is refusing. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife has always been cautious about leaving the daughter with the husband. Even when the daughter was older, the husband wasn't trusted alone for long periods. Now, with the wife pregnant, she's refusing to let him take the daughter skiing, even though his parents and brother are available to help. The husband feels his role as a father is being undermined, and he's frustrated by the repeated arguments.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's past behavior and her current state. She had a miscarriage before, which is causing her anxiety now. She's pregnant again and the stress from the arguments might be affecting her health. The husband is trying to spend time with his daughter, which is important, but the wife's safety and mental health are also critical during pregnancy.\n\nThe husband argues he hasn't harmed the daughter, but the wife's trust in him isn't there. The wife's refusal is based on her past experiences and her current vulnerability. The husband's actions, like playing energetically, might be seen as risky from her perspective. Even if the husband thinks it's just fun, the wife's fear of another miscarriage due to stress could be a valid concern.\n\nSo, while the husband wants to bond with his daughter, he needs to consider his wife's health and emotional state. The wife's trust issues might stem from past experiences, not just irrational fear. The answer might lean towards the husband being in the wrong because he's not prioritizing his wife's well-being during a high-risk pregnancy. He should find a middle ground that respects both his desire to spend time with his daughter and his wife's need for reassurance and safety.\n"
