I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the man is at fault here. The situation is that his pregnant wife refuses to let him take their daughter on a ski trip. The wife had a history of not letting him be alone with the daughter for long periods, trusting only her mother-in-law and kindergarten. Now, with her pregnancy and a previous miscarriage, she's especially anxious and doesn't trust him or his parents to handle the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man's perspective is that he's being unfairly denied the chance to bond with his daughter on a planned trip, and he feels his wife isn't trusting his judgment. He mentions he's never injured the daughter, just got a bruise once, and he plays energetically, which he thinks is his role as a father. He's frustrated by repeated arguments and feels his wife is overreacting because of her pregnancy and past trauma.\n\nOn the wife's side, she's pregnant, which is a vulnerable time, and she's worried about stress causing another miscarriage. She has a history of not trusting the husband with the daughter alone, and now the trip involves his parents. Her past experience of not being allowed to leave the daughter with others might make her anxiety about safety and the child's well-being heightened. She's also feeling neglected because he's not standing up for her against his parents' influence.\n\nKey points: The wife's anxiety is tied to her medical history (miscarriage) and her current pregnancy. The husband wants to spend quality time with his daughter but is restricted by his wife's lack of trust. The wife feels unsupported in her fears. The husband might be acting in good faith but not considering her emotional state enough. However, the wife's mistrust of her husband's parenting could be an issue. But given the context of her past trauma and current situation, maybe she's justifiably worried. The question is whether the husband is wrong in pushing for the trip despite her concerns.\n\nAlso, the wife's denial might stem from fear rather than malice. The husband needs to balance his desire to spend time with his daughter and his responsibility to support his wife's mental and physical health. If he's not causing actual harm but she's still anxious, he might need to compromise more. Maybe he's wrong in not being more empathetic to her fears, especially since her health is at stake. Alternatively, if his parenting is actually risky, that's different, but he says the only injury was a bruise. So maybe the wife's mistrust is unwarranted, but her fears are real. It's a tough balance. But since the wife is pregnant and vulnerable, the husband should prioritize her well-being. If he insists on going without addressing her concerns, he might be at fault. However, if he's trying to act in the best interest of both, maybe not. The answer hinges on whether he's being inconsiderate of her valid fears.\n"
