I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when his wife, who is now pregnant, won't let him take their daughter on a skiing trip. The key points here are the wife's history of not trusting him with their daughter, the recent pregnancy, and the previous miscarriage.\n\nFirst, the wife has always been hesitant to leave the daughter with the husband, even when the daughter was younger. The author mentions being allowed only limited time with the daughter when she was 2 or 3. Now that the daughter is almost 5, the husband wants to take her skiing with his parents and siblings nearby. But since the wife is pregnant and had a miscarriage before, she's worried about the stress and potential risks.\n\nThe author feels he's being denied his role as a father who wants to be active with his daughter. He argues he hasn't harmed the daughter and that his parents are willing to help. However, the wife's trust issues are significant here. She doesn't trust the author or his parents with the daughter. The author also mentions they've had 20 fights about this, which is a lot, especially with her being pregnant now.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's important to consider both partners' feelings and needs. The wife's anxiety is tied to her health and past trauma (the miscarriage). Her refusal might be a protective mechanism, especially given her current pregnant state. The author's desire to bond with his daughter is valid, but it seems like trust has been an ongoing issue in their relationship. The wife's lack of trust could be rooted in past experiences or fears, which the author might need to address through communication and reassurance rather than arguing.\n\nThe author's actions in trying to go skiing might be seen as not fully respecting his wife's emotional state and medical history. Even if he feels wronged, forcing the issue could exacerbate her stress and potentially harm their relationship. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong in wanting to spend time with his daughter, but he might be missing the bigger picture of his wife's mental and physical health needs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the husband wants to fulfill his role as a father, the wife's health and peace of mind are also crucial. The fact that she had a miscarriage and is now pregnant adds another layer of sensitivity. The author's repeated attempts to convince her might be causing her more anxiety, which could be detrimental to her and the baby.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting to take the daughter skiing, but he might be overlooking his wife's valid concerns and the importance of her well-being in this situation. The key issue is communication and mutual understanding, which seems lacking here. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he needs to address the underlying trust issues and his wife's health concerns more sensitively.\n"
