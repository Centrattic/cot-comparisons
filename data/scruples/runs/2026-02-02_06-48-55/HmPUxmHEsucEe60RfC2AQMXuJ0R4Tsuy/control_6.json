I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the husband (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to take his daughter on a skiing trip while his wife is pregnant. The wife doesn't trust him or his parents to be alone with their daughter, even though he's had the chance to spend time with her before. The author mentions that their daughter is almost 5, and the trip was planned months ago. Now, with the wife pregnant and having had a miscarriage before, she's anxious and unwilling to let the daughter go. The husband feels he's being unfair treatment and that the wife isn't standing up for him against her parents' influence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife's trust in the husband is a key issue. If she's never allowed him to be alone with their daughter for extended periods, that's a red flag. Even though the husband says there's been no injury, her lack of trust might indicate deeper issues. The wife's anxiety is exacerbated by her pregnancy and past miscarriage, which is understandable. Stress can affect pregnancy, so her concern about the trip causing her stress is valid. However, the husband feels he's being denied the chance to bond with his daughter, which is a father's natural desire.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's refusal is based on her mistrust and anxiety, which are legitimate emotional responses. The husband wants to spend time with his daughter, which is also valid. But if the wife's trust in him has been consistently low, maybe there are underlying issues in their relationship that need addressing. The fact that she's pregnant and vulnerable adds another layer. The husband should consider his wife's feelings and the potential impact of his insistence on the trip. If she feels that being apart from their daughter will cause her stress, leading to health risks, he might need to prioritize her well-being, even if it's difficult for him.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband isn't asking for much\u2014just to take his daughter skiing with his parents and brother nearby. The wife's trust in her own family might be better, but that doesn't mean the husband isn't justified in wanting to spend time with his daughter. The key is balance. If the wife's refusal is based solely on mistrust without valid safety concerns, that's a problem in their marriage. However, the husband should also be considerate of her medical history and current state.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's trying to engage with his daughter, which is important. However, he might not fully understand the depth of his wife's mistrust and anxiety. The wife's concerns are valid given her past, so the husband needs to find a middle ground. Maybe there's a way to compromise, like having the wife stay closer or adjusting the trip's duration. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would depend on whose perspective is more valid. The wife's trust issues might be the root here, so the husband isn't necessarily at fault, but he could be missing her emotional needs.\n"
