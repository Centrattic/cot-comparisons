I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife who's preventing the husband from taking their daughter on a ski trip. The husband feels his wife is being too controlling and doesn't trust him or his parents. The wife, on the other hand, is dealing with pregnancy after a previous miscarriage, and is clearly anxious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is trying to spend quality time with his daughter, which is a valid desire. The wife's refusal might be due to her current stress and past trauma from the miscarriage. She might fear that any stress, including arguments or the husband being away, could trigger another miscarriage. Her lack of trust in the husband's ability to handle the child alone could stem from previous incidents where she felt the child wasn't safe enough with him.\n\nThe husband mentions that he was never allowed alone with the daughter for long periods, which might have caused some resentment. However, the wife's current state is critical. Pregnancy, especially after a miscarriage, can be a very anxiety-inducing time. The wife might be overprotective because of her fears, which are not entirely irrational. The husband wants to go on the trip with the support of his parents and siblings, but the wife doesn't trust them either. That's a red flag; if she doesn't trust her own parents with the child, maybe there are deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nAlso, the husband's argument that he's just following his parents' advice and not standing up for his wife might be part of the problem. If he's not advocating for his wife's needs, that could contribute to the tension. However, he's also trying to assert his parental role by wanting to take the daughter on a trip. The question is whether his actions are reasonable given the wife's health and emotional state.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's pregnancy and anxiety, the history of the wife not trusting the husband with the daughter, and the husband's desire to bond with the child. In a healthy relationship, both partners should consider each other's well-being. If the wife's anxiety is legitimate and the husband's insistence on the trip is causing her stress, then the husband might need to compromise. However, if the wife's refusal is unreasonable and not based on real danger, the husband isn't entirely at fault.\n\nBut considering the wife's past miscarriage and current pregnancy, her fears are a real concern. The husband needs to prioritize her health here. The fact that she's having the 20th fight suggests that this is a recurring issue, not just a one-time disagreement. It might indicate a pattern where the wife's needs aren't being met. Also, the husband's energetic play with the daughter isn't necessarily a problem if there's no history of injury, but the wife's lack of trust in him and his parents is significant.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether there's a clear wrongdoer. Here, the husband is trying to do something he believes is right (spending time with the daughter), but the wife's health and safety are at stake. The husband might not be in the wrong if his intentions are good, but he might need to reconsider if his actions are causing stress to his wife. However, the wife's refusal without considering the husband's perspective could also be problematic. But given the wife's health context, maybe the husband should back off, making him not entirely at fault. Alternatively, if the wife's refusal is irrational, he might be justified. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's trying to include his daughter and his actions aren't harmful, but the wife's anxiety is also a factor. However, since the wife is pregnant and the husband's insistence is causing her stress, maybe he should prioritize her health, so perhaps he's partially at fault. But the question is whether he's the asshole. The answer might be B (No), because the wife's behavior is extreme, but the husband's intentions are good. Alternatively, if the wife's fears are valid, then the husband is being inconsiderate. It's tricky. The fact that the wife doesn't trust the parents either complicates things. Maybe the husband is in the wrong for not addressing her anxiety and pushing despite her concerns. So maybe answer A. Wait, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The author is the husband. If the wife's anxiety is legitimate, the husband might be inconsiderate. But if the wife is being overbearing, then the husband isn't at fault. Given that she's pregnant and had a miscarriage, the husband should be more accommodating. So maybe answer A. But the husband is also being excluded from the child's life. Hmm. The answer might be B (No), but I'm conflicted. Maybe the key is that the wife's behavior is the main issue, but the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to spend time with the daughter as long as it's not harming the wife. But if his insistence is causing her stress, then he is. So maybe the answer is A. But the injury part is minimal. The husband's actions aren't harmful. The wife's refusal is based on distrust and anxiety. The husband might not be in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
