I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the man wants to take his daughter on a skiing trip, but his pregnant wife won't let him. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago, and she's worried that the stress of the argument might lead to another one. The man feels he's being unfairly denied because he's a responsible parent, and he mentions that his parents and brother can help with childcare during the trip. The daughter is almost 5, so not an infant anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's perspective is that she's pregnant, has a history of a miscarriage, and is under stress from the arguments. She might feel that her health and the new pregnancy are at risk if she's stressed. Her not allowing the husband to take the daughter could be more about her own anxiety than about the daughter's safety. But the husband is trying to bond with his daughter, which is important for a father. He mentions that he's allowed limited time with his daughter before, maybe due to the wife's overprotectiveness.\n\nThe wife's concerns about the pregnancy and the past miscarriage are legitimate. Stress can affect pregnancy outcomes, so her fear isn't baseless. However, the husband is being denied something he wants to do with his daughter, which is a valid parental desire. The fact that the wife doesn't trust him or his parents with the daughter might be an issue. But maybe there's a lack of communication or compromise here.\n\nThe husband could be trying to assert his role as a father, which is important. On the other hand, the wife might be struggling with anxiety and trauma from the miscarriage, making her overprotective. The question is whether his desire to take the daughter is unreasonable given her condition. Also, the wife's refusal might be causing more stress, which is counterproductive. \n\nI need to check if there's a middle ground. Maybe the husband could reassure the wife, perhaps arranging for her to have support during the trip, or adjusting the plans to include her if possible. But the key is whether he's in the wrong. If he's being reasonable and she's being overly restrictive due to her anxiety, maybe the fault isn't entirely his. But if he's not considering her health and the pregnancy, he could be at fault. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether his actions are putting her health at risk. Since he's not taking the daughter all the time and the trip is planned with support from family, maybe he's not being negligent. The wife's refusal might be the issue here. So the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to spend time with his daughter, and her denial is due to her own stress and past trauma, not his negligence.\n"
