I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me read the situation carefully.\n\nThe husband wants to take their 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and brother's family. The wife, who is pregnant, is refusing to let him take the daughter alone. She doesn't trust him or his parents with their daughter. The husband mentions that in the past, he wasn't allowed to be alone with the daughter for long periods, only his mother-in-law and kindergarten. Now that the daughter is older, he's trying to take her on a trip. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is worried that the stress might cause another one, blaming the husband for making her nervous because he's not standing up for her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the wife's trust issues, her pregnancy and past miscarriage, and the husband's desire to spend time with his daughter. The husband feels he's not being supported by the wife, who accuses him of always following his parents' advice instead of supporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, which could make her more anxious. Her lack of trust in the husband and his parents might be due to past experiences or fear for their daughter's safety. She's also in a vulnerable state physically and emotionally, which could be making her more sensitive. The husband's past inability to be alone with their daughter might indicate that there were valid concerns in the past, even if now the daughter is older.\n\nOn the husband's side, he's trying to bond with his daughter and follow through on a planned trip. He mentions that he hasn't injured the daughter, only a bruise, and that he wants to play energetically, which is typical for a father. However, the wife's refusal might stem from deeper issues of trust or fear. The husband seems frustrated because he's trying to assert his role as a father and feels unsupported by his wife.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, communication is key. It seems like both parties have valid concerns. The wife's fear and the husband's need for bonding time are both important. However, the wife is pregnant and has a miscarriage history, which could be a legitimate reason for her to be cautious. If the husband is pushing for the trip without considering her emotional state, that could be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, if the wife is overreacting and not allowing the husband to have quality time with their daughter, that could also be an issue.\n\nBut the core issue here is trust and communication. The husband might be in the wrong if he's not addressing his wife's anxieties and instead is pushing for his own needs without considering hers. Conversely, the wife might be overstepping if her lack of trust is unwarranted, but given her history and current state, her fears might be valid. The husband also mentions that he's been fighting with her 20 times about this, which suggests a pattern of conflict without resolution. This could indicate that the husband isn't listening to her concerns, leading to repeated arguments.\n\nIn terms of parenting, the husband wants to be involved, which is important. However, the wife's refusal might be based on past experiences where the husband wasn't trusted with the daughter alone. If there were past incidents where the daughter was at risk, even if minor, the wife's concern might have merit. The husband's energetic play could be a point of contention if it's caused past injuries, even if minor.\n\nConsidering all this, the husband's actions might not be entirely wrong if he's trying to bond with his daughter, but he's not considering his wife's emotional and physical state. The wife's refusal might stem from valid fears and trust issues. However, the husband should be trying to understand her perspective and work through the conflict constructively rather than arguing repeatedly. The fact that he's had 20 fights suggests a lack of effective communication and compromise. The wife's health and emotional well-being are also important, especially during pregnancy. So, the husband's insistence on going against her wishes despite her valid concerns could make him partly at fault.\n\nI think the answer here is that the husband is not entirely in the wrong, but he also has some responsibility to address his wife's concerns. However, given the circumstances, the wife's fears and the health context, the husband's actions might be seen as not fully considering her needs. But since the question is whether he is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No). But maybe A (Yes) if the husband's behavior is exacerbating the situation. Hmm. This is tricky. I need to weigh both sides more carefully.\n\nThe user's story says the wife doesn't trust the husband or his parents. The husband isn't allowed alone with the daughter except for short periods. Now, with the wife pregnant, she's not going on the trip. The husband wants to take the daughter with his parents and siblings. The wife's denial is causing conflict. The husband's point is that he's trying to bond with the daughter, but the wife's refusal is causing stress, which could affect her pregnancy. \n\nIf the wife's refusal is based on trust issues, and the husband has a history of being restricted from being alone with their daughter, then maybe the wife's trust is justified. The husband might not be wrong in wanting to spend time with the daughter, but he needs to address the trust issue with his wife. However, since he's been fighting repeatedly, maybe he's not handling it the right way. The fact that he's been doing what his parents tell him might be a point of contention with his wife, making her feel like he doesn't support her. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (No), because the husband is trying to assert his role as a father, which is important, but the answer could also be A (Yes) if his actions are causing harm to the wife's well-being. However, given the wife's valid concerns and the husband's need to be a father, it's a complex situation where both have valid points. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the wife is in a vulnerable state, perhaps the husband isn't in the wrong, so the answer is B.\n"
