I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a husband wanting to take his daughter on a skiing trip, but his pregnant wife is refusing to let him go. The wife had a previous miscarriage and is now very anxious, especially since the author says the wife doesn't trust him or his parents to care for their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The husband feels he's being denied his parenting time, especially since his daughter is almost 5 and he wants to spend time with her. He mentions that the wife has been controlling his time with the daughter since she was 2, only allowing short periods. Now with the ski trip, there are extended family members available to help, so he's trying to make a case for his parents and brother to take care of her.\n\nThe wife's side is that she's pregnant, had a miscarriage before, and is worried that the husband's absence or arguments are stressing her, which could lead to another miscarriage. She also doesn't trust him or his parents with the daughter. The husband is frustrated because he feels he's not standing up for her, just doing what his parents suggest.\n\nThe key points here are trust issues between the couple, the wife's health and past trauma, and the husband's desire for father-daughter bonding. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting to go on the trip despite his wife's objections, especially given her fragile state.\n\nI think the husband isn't entirely in the wrong. He wants to spend time with his daughter, which is important. However, he also needs to consider his wife's valid concerns. The wife's lack of trust might stem from past experiences or anxiety, especially with the history of miscarriage. The husband could be trying to communicate better, understand her fears, and maybe find a compromise. But he's also being denied something that's important for his role as a father. There's a balance between his needs and her health.\n\nBut the wife's anxiety is real and could affect her pregnancy. If the husband is causing her stress through their arguments, that could be a problem. He might need to approach the situation more sensitively, perhaps by involving a counselor or finding another way to bond with the daughter without causing his wife distress. However, the wife's refusal might be overprotective, which is a different issue.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's a bit of both. He's not wrong to want time with his daughter, but he might be dismissing his wife's legitimate fears. The wife's trust issues need addressing too. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is that he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication and compromise. So leaning towards B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that both sides have valid points.\n"
