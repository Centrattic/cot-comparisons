I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife who won't let the husband take their daughter on a skiing trip, even though their parents and other family will be there.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband mentions that his wife has been very protective of their daughter since she was 2, not allowing him to be alone with her for more than half an hour. Now that the wife is pregnant again, she's refusing to let him take the daughter on the trip. The husband feels this is unfair because their parents and brother are available to help. The wife is also dealing with anxiety from a past miscarriage and feels the husband isn't standing up for her against his parents' advice.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The wife's perspective: she's pregnant, possibly stressed, and has a history of a miscarriage. Her trust issues with the husband and his parents might stem from her desire to protect the daughter and herself. On the other hand, the husband is being denied something he wanted to do with his daughter, and the parents and relatives are available to help. The husband's arguments are that he hasn't harmed the daughter, just plays energetically, which is typical for a father. However, the wife's anxiety and past trauma (miscarriage) are significant factors.\n\nThe husband is trying to get his way despite the wife's concerns. He mentions fighting 20 times about this, which suggests he's not listening to her feelings. The wife's trust in him and his parents is low, and he's not addressing her fears. Even if the parents are willing, if the wife doesn't trust them, forcing the situation might not be the right approach. The husband's energetic play could be a point of contention for the wife's anxiety. Also, the husband's comment about following his parents' advice might make the wife feel unsupported, which he needs to address.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The husband might not be in the wrong if he's trying to spend time with his daughter, but he's not considering the wife's emotional state and fears. The wife's refusal could be a protective measure, but it's also causing conflict. The husband's actions (arguing repeatedly) might be exacerbating the wife's stress, which is bad for her pregnancy. So, maybe the husband is partially at fault for not validating her feelings and pushing the issue. The answer might be a B (not in the wrong) because the wife's refusal is based on her anxiety and past experiences, but the husband's persistence could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. However, given the wife's pregnancy and history, the husband might need to be more accommodating. Alternatively, the wife's refusal is the main issue, but the husband's approach is also problematic. The key is whether the husband is respecting her boundaries. If he's not, then he's in the wrong. But if he's trying to find a compromise and she's not allowing it, maybe she's the one at fault. The user is asking if the author (husband) is in the wrong. The husband's actions of fighting repeatedly and not supporting his wife's needs might make him the asshole. But the wife's trust issues and past trauma are also significant. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the wife's refusal is based on her own fears, but the husband's not in the wrong if he's trying to do right by his daughter. However, the fact that he's fighting with her repeatedly and not considering her emotional state might make him the asshole. I'm a bit torn here. The wife's anxiety is valid, and the husband's persistence could be hurting her. So maybe the husband is in the wrong (A) for not respecting her emotional state and pushing the issue. But I'm not 100% sure. The key is whether the husband is violating the wife's boundaries. If the wife has legitimate fears and the husband is pressuring her, then he's wrong. If the wife's fears are irrational, the husband might not be. However, given the wife's history and current pregnancy, her fears are reasonable. The husband should prioritize her well-being over his desire to take the daughter. So the answer is A (the husband is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her boundaries and contributing to her stress, which is harmful during pregnancy.\n"
