I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who wants to take his daughter on a ski trip with his parents and siblings, but his pregnant wife won't allow it. She has a history of not trusting him with their daughter alone, and now with her new pregnancy and a past miscarriage, she's more stressed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant again after a miscarriage, which is a significant stressor. Her anxiety about the daughter's safety might be heightened. She's also mentioned not trusting the husband or his parents with the daughter for extended periods. This lack of trust could stem from past experiences or her current emotional state.\n\nThe husband argues he's never injured the daughter, only a bruise, and he plays energetically, which he sees as a father's role. But the wife's refusal might not just be about past incidents. Her recent pregnancy could make her more cautious, fearing any stress might lead to another miscarriage. She's also frustrated that he listens to his parents instead of standing up for her, which might indicate communication issues in the marriage.\n\nThe key points here are trust, communication, and the wife's mental health during pregnancy. The husband wants to spend time with his daughter, which is valid, but the wife's concerns are rooted in her current vulnerability. The fact that they've had 20 fights about this suggests a deeper problem in their relationship dynamics. The author might not be in the wrong about wanting to take the trip, but he's not addressing his wife's valid fears and stress effectively. He needs to find a middle ground, maybe by compromising or finding alternative childcare that his wife feels comfortable with. So the answer might lean towards B, the author isn't in the wrong, but he needs to handle the situation more sensitively.\n"
