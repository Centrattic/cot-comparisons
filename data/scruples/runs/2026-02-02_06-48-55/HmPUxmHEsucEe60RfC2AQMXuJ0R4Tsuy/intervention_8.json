I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a pregnant wife refusing to let the husband take their daughter on a skiing trip, despite the husband's parents and siblings being available to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife has a history of not trusting the husband with their daughter alone, even when they were younger. The husband feels he's a good father and only had minor incidents. The wife is now pregnant and anxious, fearing another miscarriage due to stress from the arguments. The husband wants to take their daughter skiing with the help of his parents and brother's family, but the wife refuses.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The wife's anxiety is understandable, especially after a previous miscarriage. Her trust in the husband's ability to care for the daughter is low, which might be causing her stress. The husband, on the other hand, might feel his parental rights are being restricted, and the trip is important to him.\n\nHowever, the main issue is the wife's mental health during pregnancy. Stress can affect pregnancy outcomes, and the husband's repeated arguments might be exacerbating her condition. The husband could be seen as not prioritizing his wife's well-being in this situation. Even though he has good intentions, respecting his wife's concerns is crucial here. The fact that she's pregnant and has a history of complications adds weight to her stance. The husband should perhaps focus on finding a compromise that reassures her, rather than pushing for his own desires. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not fully considering the impact of his actions on his wife's health and emotional state.\n"
