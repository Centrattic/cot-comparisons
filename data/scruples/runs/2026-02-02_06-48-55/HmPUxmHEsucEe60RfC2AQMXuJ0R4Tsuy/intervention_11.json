I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's wife, who is now pregnant, is refusing to let him take their daughter on a skiing trip. The author feels that since the daughter is almost 5 and his parents and brother's family will be there, it's safe to go. The wife, however, doesn't trust him or his parents with the daughter and is worried about the pregnancy, mentioning a past miscarriage and that stress might cause another one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to spend quality time with his daughter, which is understandable. He mentions that he's allowed to have her for a few hours, and now with the parents and siblings present, he thinks it's a good time. He also says he's never hurt the daughter and plays energetically, which might be part of the father-daughter bond.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is pregnant and recently had a miscarriage. Her anxiety about the pregnancy is valid, and her trust issues with the author and his parents could be causing her stress. She's denying the trip because she's worried about her own health and the safety of her daughter. The author's repeated fights with her are adding to her stress, which he's aware might trigger another miscarriage.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual trust and the wife's health. The author might be in the right in wanting to spend time with his daughter, but he's not considering the wife's emotional and physical state. His actions (pushing for the trip) could harm her pregnancy, which is a serious matter. The wife's refusal is out of concern for both her and the unborn child's well-being. The author's approach to the situation, arguing repeatedly despite her concerns, might be exacerbating her stress, making him partially responsible.\n\nSo, balancing the need for the father to bond with his daughter against the mother's right to prioritize her health and pregnancy, it seems that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could be seen as not respecting his wife's valid concerns. However, the wife's refusal is also about her health, which is a significant factor. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are causing unnecessary stress that could harm the pregnancy. If the trip is genuinely safe and the wife's trust issues are irrational, maybe the author is right. But given the wife's history and current state, her decision to avoid stress might be justified. Therefore, the author might be in the right, but the wife's stance is also understandable. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the potential harm to the pregnancy, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance here. Alternatively, if his insistence is causing her stress, he could be in the wrong (A). Hmm, this is tricky. But given the information, the wife's health is a higher priority, so the author's desire to go skiing might be secondary. Therefore, the author is in the right (B) because he's not causing harm, but the wife's refusal is about her health. Wait, but if his actions are causing her stress, then he's in the wrong. I think the key is the wife's health and the author's persistence. The answer might be A.\n"
