I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the husband) is in the wrong because his pregnant wife won't let him take their daughter on a skiing trip. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is now very nervous, especially since the husband doesn't have a history of being left alone with their daughter. The husband feels he's being treated unfairly and wants to take the daughter, with the help of his parents and brother's family.\n\nFirst, the wife's current pregnancy is a significant factor. After a miscarriage, it's common for women to feel anxious or have heightened fears. Her refusal to go skiing might be to protect herself and the new pregnancy. She's denying the trip because she doesn't trust the husband or his parents with the daughter, even though the husband has been allowed to spend time with her before. The wife's trust issues are likely rooted in her past experience and her current vulnerability.\n\nThe husband mentions he likes to play energetic with their daughter, which could be a point of contention. While energetic play is normal for a father, if the wife feels that this could pose a risk, her trust in him might be low. The key here is the wife's emotional state and her justified fear. The husband is frustrated because he's been allowed to spend time with the daughter in the past, but maybe the duration and context of this skiing trip are different. A multi-day trip with extended care from his parents might be more stressful for the wife than a few hours alone before.\n\nAlso, the wife is denying the trip because she's making the husband stay put, but the husband is focusing on his inability to take the daughter. The fact that he's arguing 20 times might indicate that he's not respecting her feelings and the new circumstances. The wife's previous experiences (miscarriage) and current pregnancy add layers of stress and anxiety. Her priority is likely the safety of both the daughter and her unborn child, which the husband may not fully understand.\n\nThe husband's parents and brother are available to help, but the wife doesn't trust them either. That's a red flag. If the wife can't trust her own in-laws, maybe there were past incidents where her trust was broken. The husband might need to address why his wife doesn't trust his parents, even if he thinks they're reliable. It's possible that the wife's fears are not entirely rational, but they are real to her. The husband's frustration is valid, but so is the wife's anxiety and need for support.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is trying to assert his role as a father, which is important. However, during a high-stress period for the wife, especially with a recent miscarriage and current pregnancy, it's crucial to prioritize her mental and physical health. The answer might depend on whether the husband is being reasonable in his request given the wife's state. If the trip is a continuation of a planned family event and the wife is suddenly denying it without considering alternatives, that's different. But in this case, the wife is denying the husband's participation in the trip because she doesn't trust him or his parents, which suggests her emotional needs are paramount right now.\n\nSo, while the husband's desire to spend time with his daughter is understandable, the wife's feelings and the need for her to feel secure are more critical. The husband might be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging her valid concerns and the stress this is causing her. The wife's trust issues need to be addressed, but the husband should also be patient and supportive instead of pushing for his own needs in this situation.\n"
