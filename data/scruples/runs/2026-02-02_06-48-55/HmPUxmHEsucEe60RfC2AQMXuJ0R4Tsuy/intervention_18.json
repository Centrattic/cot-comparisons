I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where his pregnant wife won't let him take their daughter on a skiing trip. The key points here are the wife's history of not trusting the author with their daughter alone, the recent pregnancy, and the stress from previous arguments.\n\nFirst, the wife has a history of not allowing the author to be alone with their daughter. Even when she was younger, she wasn't left with him for long periods. Now that the wife is pregnant and has had a miscarriage, her anxiety is likely heightened. She's worried about the child's safety and her own health during the pregnancy. The author's insistence on going skiing despite her concerns might be exacerbating her stress, which could be harmful, especially after a past miscarriage.\n\nThe author mentions he plays energetically with the daughter, which is typical for a father, but the wife's trust issues might stem from past experiences where he didn't handle her safely. Even if he hasn't caused injuries, her lack of trust is significant. The fact that she's having a hard time letting him go on this trip with other family members present (parents and brother) suggests her anxiety isn't just about the author but maybe the situation itself. However, her trust in the author is a key factor here.\n\nThe author is also fighting with his wife repeatedly, which is stressing her out. Since she's pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, her stress could be a real concern. The author might not see his actions as causing harm, but by pushing for the trip, he's not considering her emotional state and medical history. The wife's main issue is trust and safety, and the author's insistence could be seen as dismissive of her valid concerns.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are contributing to her stress and not respecting her boundaries. Even if his intentions are good, he's not addressing her fears and the situation's sensitivity. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
