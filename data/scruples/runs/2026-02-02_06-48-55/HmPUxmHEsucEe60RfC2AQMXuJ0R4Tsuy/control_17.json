I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband wants to take his daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and his brother's family. The wife is pregnant and doesn't trust him or his parents to take care of the daughter. The wife is worried about the daughter's safety and her own health because of the pregnancy and a previous miscarriage. They've had previous issues where the wife didn't want the husband alone with the daughter, only allowing certain people to take care of her. The husband feels he's being unfair treated, especially since he's trying to bond with the daughter and the parents are willing to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife is pregnant and has a history of a miscarriage, so she's more anxious. Her trust issues might stem from past experiences or fears of the current pregnancy. She might feel that leaving the daughter with the husband or his parents is too risky. The husband, on the other hand, feels like the wife isn't trusting him and is making irrational demands. He mentions he's never hurt the daughter, just some bruises from energetic play, which he considers normal father behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's health and anxiety, the daughter's safety, and the husband's desire for father-daughter bonding. The wife's refusal to allow the trip could be due to valid concerns about her own physical state and the daughter's well-being. The husband's frustration is understandable, but does that make him in the wrong?\n\nI should check if the husband's actions are reasonable. He wants to spend time with his daughter, which is a valid desire. However, the wife's health is a priority, especially with a complicated pregnancy. If the wife is stressed by the idea of the trip, that could affect her and the baby. The husband might be pushing too hard, not considering her medical needs. Also, the wife's past issues with trusting him to care for the daughter suggest that there might be underlying issues in their communication or history that need addressing.\n\nThe wife's argument that the husband always follows his parents' advice and doesn't stand up for her could indicate a pattern of not being supportive in her decisions. But in this case, the husband is trying to do what he thinks is best for the child. However, the wife's safety and mental state are also important. If the trip is causing her stress and anxiety, which could lead to complications, then the husband's insistence might be contributing to a harmful situation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the wife had a miscarriage a year ago adds to her anxiety. She might be more cautious now, and her fear could be legitimate. The husband needs to balance his desire for bonding with the daughter against his wife's need for a stress-free pregnancy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like it's a complex situation where both parties have valid concerns. The wife's health and the daughter's safety are important. The husband's desire for bonding is valid too. However, if the husband is ignoring the wife's medical advice and causing her stress, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that they've had 20 fights about this suggests a lack of resolution and possible communication issues. The husband might not be considering his wife's medical needs as much as he should, which could make him at least partially at fault. On the other hand, the wife's lack of trust in her husband might also be an issue. But given the context, the primary issue is the wife's health and the potential impact of stress on her pregnancy. Therefore, the husband's insistence on the trip despite her concerns might make him at fault. So, the answer could be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). However, if the wife's refusal is unreasonable despite the parents being available, maybe B. But considering the wife's health and her history, it's more about her needing to be stress-free. The husband might be in the wrong because he's not prioritizing her health in this situation.\n"
