I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband wants to take their 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip, but the pregnant wife won't let him. She's had a miscarriage before and is worried about the stress affecting her current pregnancy. The husband feels he's a capable dad, mentions he's never injured the daughter except a minor bruise, and wants to play energetically. The wife is distrustful of him and his parents, and the couple is fighting a lot, especially because she's pregnant now.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the husband is trying to spend quality time with his daughter, which is important for bonding. He has supportive parents and a brother who can help. The wife's trust issues might stem from past experiences or anxiety from the miscarriage. Maybe her control over child-rearing is leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's fears are valid. Pregnancy and past miscarriage can make her more anxious. Her denial of the trip could be protective, but it's causing strain. The husband's insistence might not consider her emotional state. He mentions she doesn't trust him, which could indicate deeper issues in their relationship. The husband's defense that he's not hurt the daughter before might not address her underlying anxiety.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? He's trying to assert his role as a father, but maybe he's not considering his wife's emotional state enough. The wife's mental health during pregnancy is crucial, and constant arguments might be harmful. However, the husband's right to bond with his daughter is also valid. The key is balance. If he's not respecting her boundaries due to her current vulnerability, he might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if she's being overly restrictive without valid reasons, he's justified. But given her history, her anxiety is real. The husband might need to find a middle ground, like a shorter trip or involving her in the planning to ease her concerns. Since he's pushing despite her objections and the potential impact on her pregnancy, maybe he's not in the wrong entirely, but there's room for compromise. However, the wife's health and peace of mind are important. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his actions are reasonable given her situation. If he's disregarding her valid concerns, AITA would say yes. If he's trying to balance both, maybe not. Given the repeated fights and her specific fears, I think the author is in the wrong because he's not considering her medical and emotional state sufficiently.\n"
