I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where his pregnant wife won't let him take their daughter on a skiing trip. The key points here are the wife's trust issues, the daughter's safety, and the wife's recent pregnancy after a miscarriage.\n\nFirst, the wife has a history of not trusting the author or the author's parents with their daughter. Even when the daughter was older, the wife was very restrictive. Now that the author's parents and other family are willing to help, the wife is still not allowing the trip. The author argues that he's a good father, but the wife is worried about the daughter's safety and her own emotional state due to the previous miscarriage.\n\nThe author wants to take his daughter on a trip, which he sees as a bonding experience, but the wife is clearly against it. The fact that she's pregnant and has a history of miscarriage makes her more sensitive. The author's actions, like being energetic with the daughter, might be seen as risky by the wife. Even though the author hasn't harmed the daughter, the wife's trust is low, which is affecting her mental health. The author is not considering her anxiety as much as he should. He's focusing on his desire to have time with the daughter without acknowledging how his actions might exacerbate her fears. The wife's feelings are valid, especially given her past experience. The author might be in the wrong because he's not prioritizing her emotional well-being and the reasons behind her restrictions. So, the answer would be A.\n"
