I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband wanting to take their daughter on a ski trip while the wife is pregnant, but she's refusing to let him take the daughter alone. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The wife has a history of not trusting the husband with their daughter. He wasn't allowed to be alone with her for more than half an hour when she was 2, and even up to 4 hours at age 3. The wife is now pregnant again, which adds stress, especially since she had a miscarriage before. She's worried that the husband's actions are making her nervous, which could lead to another miscarriage.\n\nThe husband argues that he's never hurt the daughter, only a bruise from energetic play. He wants to bond with his daughter and is frustrated that the wife doesn't trust him. He also mentions that his parents and brother can help during the trip. But the wife still refuses, not trusting him or his parents.\n\nNow, considering if the husband is in the wrong. The key points are the wife's trust issues, her current pregnancy, and her fear of another miscarriage. The husband's desire to spend time with their daughter is understandable, but the wife's concerns are valid given her past and current state. The husband might be pushing too much without considering her emotional state. Also, the wife's trust in the parents is already limited, so even having them there doesn't help. \n\nThe husband's energetic play might be seen as a point of contention. While playful, it could lead to accidents, which the wife fears. The fact that they've had 20 fights on this issue shows a significant breakdown in communication. The wife's mental health during pregnancy is crucial, and the husband's insistence might be adding unnecessary stress, which could indeed be harmful given her history.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband isn't doing anything malicious. He's trying to be a present father. But the wife's lack of trust and the current pregnancy context make her position more vulnerable. The answer might hinge on whether the husband's actions are reasonable given her fears. Since he's not physically abusive but the wife's mental health is at risk, the fault might lie with him for not prioritizing her well-being over his desire to take the daughter.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his wife's concerns and is causing her stress during a critical time, which could jeopardize her pregnancy. His actions, while well-intentioned, are contributing to her anxiety, and he's not addressing her trust issues effectively.\n"
