I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife not allowing the husband to take their daughter on a ski trip with his parents and other family. The husband feels it's unfair, especially since he's never had that kind of time alone with the child before, and he's been trusted by others. The wife is pregnant, had a miscarriage before, and is worried about stress affecting the pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife's concern is her safety and the health of her unborn child. She's been through a miscarriage, so her anxiety is understandable. Her trust in the husband and his parents is a big factor here. Even if the husband hasn't actually harmed the child, the wife's lack of trust could be due to past experiences or her current stress levels from the pregnancy.\n\nOn the husband's side, he's trying to bond with his daughter in a way he feels is appropriate, like playing energetically. He might feel his parental role is being restricted. But the wife's mental health and the pregnancy's viability are critical. The fact that this is causing repeated arguments might indicate communication issues. The wife might be feeling overwhelmed, and the husband's insistence could be adding to her stress, which could indeed affect her pregnancy, as she mentioned.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. It seems like the wife's health and the unborn child's safety are primary concerns. The husband's desire to spend time with the daughter is valid, but if the wife's anxiety is genuine and the trip could cause her stress, then maybe the husband needs to prioritize her well-being. The fact that the wife is pregnant and the potential risks from stress should be a key factor. The husband might not be in the wrong in terms of his intentions, but he might be overlooking his wife's legitimate concerns and the medical implications. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but his approach could be improved. However, the main issue is the wife's health and pregnancy, so the answer might lean towards the wife being within her rights to refuse, but the husband's actions might not be wrong. Hmm. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since the wife's decision is based on her pregnancy and past trauma, and the husband's actions could be causing her stress, perhaps the husband is not in the wrong, but the wife's stance is also valid. Wait, but the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. Given that the wife is in a high-stress situation with a recent pregnancy and history of miscarriage, and the husband's insistence might be exacerbating her stress, maybe the husband is in the wrong by not considering her health enough. So answer A. But wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But maybe the answer is B. Wait, the user is asking for my perspective. Let me recheck the details. The wife is denying the trip because she's pregnant and fears another miscarriage due to stress from the arguments. The husband is arguing that he's been trusted by others and wants to bond with the daughter. The key is whether the wife's refusal is reasonable. If her stress is a real concern, then the husband should comply to protect her health. Therefore, the husband might not be in the wrong, but the wife's refusal is justified. So answer B. But if the husband is pushing despite her valid concerns, maybe he is in the wrong. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. The answer probably is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the wife's decision is based on her health and the pregnancy, which is a valid reason. The husband isn't doing anything harmful, just not getting his way. So the answer is B.\n"
