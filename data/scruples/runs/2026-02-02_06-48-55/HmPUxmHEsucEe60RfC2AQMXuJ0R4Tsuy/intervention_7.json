I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a dad whose wife is pregnant and doesn't want to go on a skiing trip. He wants to take their daughter on the trip, but the wife is refusing because she doesn't trust him or his parents to take care of their daughter. The daughter is almost 5, and the author has been allowed alone with her only for short periods before. The parents and brother are available to help. The wife is pregnant after a miscarriage, and this is causing her stress. The author is frustrated because he wants to spend time with his daughter, especially since he likes to play energetically with her, which he sees as a father's role. They've had a lot of fights about this, and the wife is upset that he's not standing up for her against his parents.\n\nHmm, so the key points are the wife's lack of trust, the daughter's safety, the wife's current pregnancy and past miscarriage, and the author's desire to bond with his daughter. \n\nFirst, the wife's trust in her husband's ability to care for their daughter is a big issue. If she's never allowed him to be alone with their daughter for long, maybe there's a history of some concern. The author says the daughter's worst injury was a bruise, which he attributes to energetic play. But the wife doesn't trust him, which might mean she feels he could be too rough or that the parents aren't trustworthy either. Even if there's no actual harm, the wife's anxiety is valid, especially during pregnancy and after a miscarriage. Her stress could affect her health and the pregnancy.\n\nThe author wants to go on the trip, but the wife is adamant. The question is whether he's wrong to push for going without her. He mentions that the parents are willing to help, but the wife doesn't trust them either. That complicates things. If the parents are reliable, maybe the wife's distrust is unfounded, but if there's a reason she doesn't trust them, that's another layer. The author's argument is that he wants to have a bond with his daughter through energetic play, which is important for a father. But the wife's feelings and health are also important.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to assert his right to spend time with his daughter, but he has to consider his wife's feelings and health. Since she's pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, her stress could be a real medical concern. If he goes against her wishes, he might be adding to her stress, which could harm the pregnancy. On the other hand, he's not doing anything that's actually proven harmful; the daughter's injuries were minor. The wife's lack of trust might stem from past issues or personality factors. But during pregnancy, her anxiety is heightened, and her needs are critical.\n\nI think the author's mistake is not fully respecting his wife's feelings and health in this situation. Even if he believes he's right, forcing the issue could be detrimental to the wife and the unborn child. The fact that they've had 20 fights shows that this is a significant point of contention, and he needs to prioritize her well-being. So, he might be in the wrong because he's not prioritizing his wife's emotional and physical health, which is more critical now. The answer could be A.\n"
