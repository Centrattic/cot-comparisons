I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband wanting to take his daughter on a ski trip with his parents and his brother's kids, but his pregnant wife is refusing because she doesn't trust him or his parents with their daughter. The husband feels he's being unfairly restricted, especially since he's never hurt the daughter and thinks it's part of being a father to play energetically.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is pregnant again after a miscarriage, which makes her more anxious. She might be worried about her health and the new pregnancy, so the stress of the husband taking their daughter away could trigger her fears. Her decision to deny the trip might be protective, even if it seems over the top to the husband. On the other hand, the husband is trying to spend quality time with his daughter, which is important for their relationship. He's asking his parents and extended family for help, which they're willing to provide. \n\nThe key points here are the wife's health and emotional state. Since she's pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, her anxiety is understandable. The husband's insistence on going might not be considering her current vulnerability. Even if he hasn't hurt the daughter before, the wife's lack of trust in him and his parents suggests there's a history of control issues in their parenting approach. The husband might be overemphasizing his role as a father who should play energetically, but the wife's primary concern is the safety and well-being of both children.\n\nI should also think about the dynamic between the couple. The wife feels that the husband doesn't stand up for her, which adds to the tension. The repeated fights indicate a communication problem. The husband might be in the wrong because he's not taking her current situation into account and pushing for something that causes her significant stress. Even if his intentions are good, the impact on her health and emotional state is a critical factor here. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
