I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants to take their daughter on a skiing trip, but the pregnant wife is refusing. He mentions that she's never trusted him alone with their daughter and now, with her being pregnant and having a past miscarriage, she's even more anxious. He's frustrated because he wants to spend time with the kids and feels she's not trusting him or his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband feels he's being denied a chance to bond with his daughter, especially since the wife is staying home due to pregnancy. He's arguing that he's never hurt the daughter and that he wants to play energetically, which is a typical fatherly role. He also mentions that his parents and brother can help, so the wife's refusal might be based on emotional factors rather than safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is pregnant, has a history of a miscarriage, and is clearly anxious. Her refusal might stem from fear of something happening if she's not with the daughter. She's also been through a past miscarriage, which could make her more protective. The husband is trying to go on a trip, but the wife is not in a good emotional state right now. The fact that they've had 20 fights about this suggests that there's underlying tension and communication issues.\n\nThe husband's main point is that he's not in the wrong because he's not endangering the daughter. However, the wife's feelings and health are also important, especially during pregnancy. If her anxiety is causing her stress, which she claims could lead to another miscarriage, then the husband's insistence might be harmful. The question is whether his actions are reasonable given her current state.\n\nI think the key here is about mutual respect and considering each other's feelings. The husband wants to spend time with the daughter, but the wife's refusal is based on her anxiety and past trauma. If he's pushing for the trip despite her concerns, he might be prioritizing his needs over hers. However, the wife's distrust of him and his parents might be irrational, but given her history, it's understandable. The husband could be trying to assert his parental role, but he needs to balance that with her emotional well-being.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for who is being unreasonable. The husband is trying to act in the child's best interest, but if his actions are causing his wife undue stress, which could affect her pregnancy, then he might be at fault. The wife's refusal, while perhaps overprotective, is driven by her fear. However, the husband's argument is that he's capable and the parents are available. Still, the fact that she's pregnant and her anxiety is heightened could mean that he should be more accommodating. So, maybe he's in the wrong for not respecting her current emotional state and pushing for the trip despite her objections.\n"
