I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife is pregnant and doesn't want to go on a skiing trip. The husband wants to take his daughter, but the wife is denying it. The wife has always been cautious about leaving the daughter with the husband or his parents, even though the daughter is almost 5. The husband says he's never hurt the child, just plays energetic, which he thinks is a father's role. The wife is concerned about the pregnancy and the risk of another miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife's anxiety seems to be heightened because of her pregnancy, especially after a previous miscarriage. That's a significant factor. She's not just being overprotective, but dealing with real fears. The husband, on the other hand, feels he's being unfairly restricted, especially since others like the in-laws and kindergarten are trusted. However, the wife doesn't trust the husband or his parents, which is a key point.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The wife's refusal might be about her emotional state and physical health, not just the daughter's safety. The husband's argument is that he's a capable parent and wants to bond with his daughter, but he's also been told he's not sticking up for his wife, which the wife is upset about. There's a possible miscommunication here. The husband might be trying to assert his parental role, but the wife might feel he's not prioritizing her well-being. \n\nI should also consider that after a miscarriage, a woman's stress can affect her current pregnancy, so the wife's anxiety is valid. The husband's desire to take the daughter on a trip is reasonable, but the wife's refusal could be a protective measure for herself. The husband's frustration is understandable, but is he wrong for wanting to go? Maybe not, but he might need to approach it differently, showing more empathy towards his wife's fears instead of just pushing for his own wishes. \n\nThe answer might not be a simple A or B. However, the options are to choose between the author being in the wrong (A) or not (B). Given that the wife's concerns are valid due to her medical history and current pregnancy, and the husband isn't necessarily abusive but is perhaps not fully considering her feelings, it's possible that the husband isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for him to be more supportive. However, the wife's denial might be overstepping, but given her circumstances, it's a tough call. I think the answer would lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's a need for compromise.\n"
