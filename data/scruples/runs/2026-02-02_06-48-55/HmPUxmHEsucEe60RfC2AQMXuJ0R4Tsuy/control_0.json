I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for wanting to take their daughter on a skiing trip while the wife is pregnant. The wife had a previous miscarriage and is now very anxious about going on the trip. She doesn't trust the husband or his parents to be alone with their daughter. The husband feels he's being unjustly restricted because he's never harmed the child and wants to bond with her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife\u2019s concerns are significant. She's pregnant, had a miscarriage before, and is under a lot of stress. Her anxiety could be affecting her health, which is a valid medical concern. She might feel that the husband isn't prioritizing her well-being by pushing for the trip. Also, her lack of trust in her husband and his parents to care for their daughter is a big issue. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and if she doesn't trust him, that's a problem.\n\nOn the husband's side, he's trying to spend quality time with his daughter, which is important for bonding. He might feel that his parenting skills are being questioned. The fact that he's allowed to take her for longer periods now (like 4 hours) suggests some progress, but the wife's sudden refusal post-pregnancy might be due to increased anxiety. The husband also feels disrespected because he's following his parents' advice and not standing up for his wife, according to her.\n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not the one who had the injury. The daughter's only injury was a bruise, so he's not being reckless. However, the wife's mental and physical health during pregnancy is critical. If the trip causes her stress and could lead to complications, he might be ignoring her medical needs. Also, the fact that she doesn't trust him or his parents could indicate deeper issues in their relationship that need addressing. \n\nBut he's trying to maintain a relationship with his daughter, which is also important. The key here is balancing both parents' roles and the child's needs. Maybe the husband isn't respecting her boundaries, even if he thinks they're unfair. Since the wife is pregnant and vulnerable, his insistence might be harmful. However, he's not the one being careless with the child. \n\nI think the main issue is the wife's trust and her health. The husband should be more considerate of her anxiety, especially given her history. Even if he feels it's unfair, he needs to prioritize her well-being. So, maybe he's in the wrong for not addressing her concerns more effectively and pushing despite her clear discomfort. But I'm not entirely sure. It's a tricky balance between parental rights and a spouse's health.\n"
