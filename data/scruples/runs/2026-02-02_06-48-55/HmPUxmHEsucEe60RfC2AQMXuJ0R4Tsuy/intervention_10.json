I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a father whose pregnant wife refuses to let him take their 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip. The wife was already wary of leaving the daughter with him even before the pregnancy, only allowing him alone time when the child was very young. Now, with the wife pregnant and having had a miscarriage a year ago, she's even more hesitant. The author wants to take the daughter with him, and the parents and in-laws are willing to help, but the wife doesn't trust them. The author argues that he's never hurt the child and likes to play energetically, which he sees as part of his role as a father. However, the wife is worried the stress might cause another miscarriage and feels the author isn't standing up for her by relying on his parents' advice.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about parental trust and the wife's justified anxiety due to her medical history. The wife's fear of another miscarriage is a real concern, especially given her past experience. The author is frustrated because he feels he can handle the child and that the parents can help. But the wife is the one making the decision here, and her trust in her husband and his parents is low. \n\nThe author's argument is that he's being reasonable and that the wife is being overly controlling. However, considering the wife's health and the pregnancy, her primary concern is the well-being of both herself and the new baby. If she's not comfortable with the arrangement, perhaps the author should prioritize her health and the baby's safety. \n\nBut then there's the daughter's well-being too. The author wants to spend time with her, which is important for bonding. However, the wife's trust in the father's ability to care for the daughter is already strained. The author mentions that he's energetic, which might be a point of contention. Maybe the wife feels he's too rough with the daughter, even if he hasn't caused harm before.\n\nThe author is also using his parents as a solution, but the wife doesn't trust them either. That suggests there's an underlying issue in the relationship regarding trust and child-rearing decisions. The author might be dismissing his wife's concerns as unnecessary, which could be part of the problem. The wife might feel unheard or unvalued if he keeps pushing for his way despite her reservations.\n\nIn terms of responsibilities, both parents should make joint decisions regarding their children's care, especially when one is in a vulnerable health state. The author's insistence on taking the daughter skiing despite his wife's objections could be seen as not respecting her medical needs and emotional state. The wife's fear of another miscarriage is valid, and the author should consider that she's prioritizing the family's health over his desire for quality time with the daughter.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's not fully acknowledging his wife's justified concerns and her medical history. The key here is the balance between parental rights and the need to protect the wife's health. The author's actions could be causing unnecessary stress to the wife, which might indeed affect her pregnancy. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A). But I need to check if there's any other angle I'm missing. Maybe if the wife's restrictions are unreasonable, but given the context of a previous miscarriage and her current stress, it's more about her needing support and accommodations rather than the author pushing back. Yeah, I think the answer is A.\n"
