I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's wife, who is now pregnant, won't let him take their daughter on a skiing trip with their parents and brother's family. The author argues that he's been allowed to spend time alone with their daughter before, just not for very long. Now that the daughter is almost 5, he wants to take her skiing with the family, but the wife is refusing because of her pregnancy and past issues, including a miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is pregnant and had a miscarriage, so her stress levels might be higher. She might be worried about the child's safety and her own health. She doesn't trust the husband or his parents to take care of the daughter, even though the husband says there have been no major injuries. The wife's denial could be\u51fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5973\u513f\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5979\u6000\u5b55\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u8eab\u4f53\u548c\u60c5\u7eea\u90fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u8106\u5f31\u3002\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels he's being unfair. He mentions that he's allowed his daughter to interact with his parents and brother's kids, which are positive experiences. He's also the one who plays more energetically with the daughter, which is a common fatherly role. The fact that the daughter is almost 5 might mean she's more independent, but the wife's trust issues are still there.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's current pregnancy and history of miscarriage, which could justify her anxiety. She's not letting the husband take the daughter on a trip, which might be because she's worried about the daughter being in someone else's care and her own stress affecting the pregnancy. The husband, however, feels he's being denied his fatherly time, especially since the parents are available.\n\nI should check if there's any past behavior from the husband that would justify the wife's distrust. The husband says the daughter's biggest injury was a bruise, and he plays energetically. Maybe the wife is overreacting, but given her medical history, her anxiety is valid. The husband's frustration is understandable, but in a situation where the wife is pregnant and vulnerable, his actions (like fighting constantly) might not be the best approach. He needs to consider her mental and physical state, even if he believes he's doing the right thing.\n\nAlso, the wife's statement that he always follows his parents' advice and doesn't stick up for her suggests there's a communication issue in the relationship. The husband might not be addressing her concerns properly, leading to repeated arguments.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the wife's refusal is likely due to her medical condition and anxiety, which the husband needs to respect. He might be in the wrong for not understanding her current state and pushing for something that causes her stress. The answer might be A, but I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the husband isn't overstepping and is just wanting to spend time, maybe it's a balance. But given the wife's health, it's more about her well-being. So the answer is A because the husband is in the wrong for not respecting her needs during pregnancy.\n"
