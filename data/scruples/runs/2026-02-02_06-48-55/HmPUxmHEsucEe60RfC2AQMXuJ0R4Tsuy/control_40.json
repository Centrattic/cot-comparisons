I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a pregnant wife who won't let the husband take their daughter on a skiing trip, even though the parents-in-law and other family are there to help. The husband feels he's being treated unfairly because he's never been allowed alone with the daughter before, and now the wife is especially strict post-pregnancy and after a miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is asking if he's at fault. The wife's main concerns are trust issues with the husband and possibly her own anxiety from the previous miscarriage. She might be overprotective due to her pregnancy and past trauma. The husband, on the other hand, feels he's being reasonable and that the family support should be enough. He also mentions he plays energetically with the daughter, which might be a point of contention if the wife is worried about the child's safety.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's trust issues and her anxiety. The husband isn't harming the daughter, but the wife's refusal could stem from deeper insecurities or past experiences. The fact that she had a miscarriage might exacerbate her fears, making her more protective. The husband's frustration is valid, but he needs to consider her emotional state and the reasons behind her resistance.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong for wanting to take the daughter skiing? Maybe not directly. But if he's dismissing her concerns without understanding, that could be an issue. The problem is mutual: the wife's trust issues and the husband's need for more autonomy in parenting. The husband might need to approach this with more empathy, acknowledging her fears rather than just pushing for his own wishes.\n\nAlso, the wife's claim that he always follows his parents' advice might be a point of tension about their communication. If the husband isn't standing up for his wife's needs or his own, that could be a problem. But in this specific case, the core issue is her refusal to allow him to take the child, which might be her overprotectiveness rather than the husband being wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the husband's actions (wanting to take the daughter) aren't inherently wrong, but the wife's refusal is based on valid emotional concerns. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a need for better communication and understanding from both sides.\n"
