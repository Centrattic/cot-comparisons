I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants to take their daughter skiing with his parents and brother's family, but the pregnant wife refuses. The wife had a miscarriage before and is now very anxious, thinking that the stress might cause another one. The husband feels he's being denied a chance to bond with his daughter, as he's been trusted more but the wife doesn't trust him or his parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife is pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, so her anxiety is legitimate. The stress from arguments might affect her health and the pregnancy. The husband is trying to spend quality time with his daughter, which is also important. But he's been allowed only limited time before, and the wife's trust in him and his parents is an issue here.\n\nThe husband mentions he's never injured the daughter, but the wife doesn't trust him. Maybe past experiences or the wife's own insecurities are causing this. The wife is in a vulnerable state, and her health is a priority. The husband's desire to bond is valid, but he needs to balance it with his wife's needs during pregnancy. Repeated arguments could be harmful. So, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong, but he's not handling it the best way. But the key is whether he's in the wrong legally or morally. Since the wife's health is at risk due to stress, the husband's insistence might be contributing to that. However, the wife's refusal could be overprotective. The answer might be B (No) because both have valid points, but the wife's health is critical. Alternatively, maybe the husband is wrong to keep pushing despite her valid concerns. Hmm.\n"
