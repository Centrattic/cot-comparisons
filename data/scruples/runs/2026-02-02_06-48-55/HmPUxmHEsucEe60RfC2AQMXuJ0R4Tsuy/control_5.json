I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a pregnant wife not allowing her husband to take their daughter on a skiing trip, even though the husband's parents and brother will be there. The husband feels he's being denied time with his daughter and is frustrated because the wife doesn't trust him or his parents. He mentions that the daughter is almost 5 and that they had planned the trip months ago. The wife got pregnant a few weeks ago and is now more anxious, citing a past miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant, which comes with natural anxiety, especially after a previous miscarriage. Her fear might be heightened, and she's worried about the stress affecting her pregnancy. She might feel that the husband isn't supporting her enough, leading to arguments. The fact that she's denying him the trip could be due to her own stress and not just about trust.\n\nOn the husband's side, he's feeling deprived of his role as a father. He wants to bond with his daughter through the skiing trip, which he sees as a father-daughter activity. He's also pointing out that his family is available to help, and he hasn't harmed the daughter before. However, the wife doesn't trust him or his parents with the daughter, which is a significant point.\n\nThe key factors here are the wife's health and emotional state, the history of the miscarriage, and the husband's desire for father-daughter time. The wife's refusal might be more about her own anxiety and past trauma rather than the husband being untrustworthy. The husband might not fully grasp how his insistence affects her stress levels, especially during pregnancy.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the husband could reassure her more, involve her in planning, or find a compromise. But the current situation is a stalemate. The wife's safety and mental health are crucial, especially with a history of miscarriage. If her stress is high because of the arguments, that could be detrimental. The husband's actions might be well-intentioned, but he's not considering her emotional state enough.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether his actions are contributing to her stress, which they might be. If he's pushing for the trip despite her concerns, he's not prioritizing her health. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not fully considering his wife's emotional and physical well-being during her pregnancy, especially given her past issues.\n"
