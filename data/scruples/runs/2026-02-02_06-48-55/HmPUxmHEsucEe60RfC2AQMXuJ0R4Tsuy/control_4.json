I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband wants to take their daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and brother's family, but the pregnant wife is refusing. The wife had a miscarriage before and is now very anxious about the pregnancy. The husband feels he's being denied something he's earned, and he's frustrated because he's not allowed to be alone with the daughter often. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife is pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, so her anxiety is understandable. She's not trusting the husband or his parents with their daughter, which might stem from past experiences when she didn't allow the husband to be alone with the daughter even for short periods. The husband, on the other hand, feels he's being treated unfairly, especially since he's not the one who caused the injury mentioned (just a bruise). He wants to have a father-daughter bonding time, which is also valid.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's health and the daughter's well-being. The wife's refusal might be rooted in her fear of losing another child, which could make her overprotective. The husband's actions are about wanting to spend time with his daughter, but he has to respect his wife's emotional state. The wife might feel that any stress could lead to another miscarriage, so she's trying to avoid situations that could cause her stress, even if it's about their daughter's care. \n\nAlso, the husband mentions that the wife accuses him of not standing up for her. That suggests that maybe he hasn't communicated effectively with her, relying on his parents' support without considering her feelings. If he's not advocating for her in other ways, she might feel unsupported now during her pregnancy. \n\nBut is the husband in the wrong for wanting to take the daughter? Well, he's trying to do something positive with his child. However, if the wife's anxiety is so high that it's affecting her health, then he might need to prioritize her well-being. However, he also has a right to his parenting time. The problem is the lack of compromise. Maybe the husband isn't seeing the wife's perspective fully. If the wife's fear is irrational, maybe he should address that gently. But given her history, it's not entirely irrational. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if he's trying to balance both his needs and the wife's health. However, if he's not considering her anxiety and pushing too hard, maybe he's not fully in the right. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's mental and physical health is crucial here. If the husband's insistence could actually harm her, then he's in the wrong. If he's just trying to have reasonable time with his daughter, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the husband's intentions are good, and the wife's refusal is due to her health issues. The husband isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to take the daughter, but he might need to find another solution to address his wife's concerns without forcing the issue. He might need to communicate better and find a middle ground, but he isn't in the wrong for wanting to spend time with his daughter.\n"
