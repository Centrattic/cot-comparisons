I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who wants to take his daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and brother's family, but his pregnant wife refuses to let him go. The wife has a history of not trusting him alone with the daughter, and now with her pregnancy and a past miscarriage, she's more anxious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband feels he's being unfairly restricted by his wife. He mentions that he's never hurt the daughter, only a bruise once, and he wants to be a playful father. He's planning a trip with family support, which might be a good environment. On the other hand, the wife has valid concerns, especially given her past miscarriage and the current pregnancy. Her anxiety is causing her stress, which could potentially affect the pregnancy. She might be overprotective, but her fears are real and rooted in experience.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The husband feels his parenting is being questioned, while the wife is struggling with anxiety. The wife's refusal might be about her need to feel secure, both for her daughter and the unborn child. The husband might be dismissing her fears as unnecessary, not recognizing the emotional toll of a previous miscarriage. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband's desire to bond with his daughter is important, but so is the wife's mental and physical health. If the wife's anxiety is leading to stress that could harm her pregnancy, that's a serious concern. The husband might not be considering how his insistence on going affects her well-being. However, the wife's lack of trust in his ability to care for their daughter, even with family present, could be an issue in their relationship that needs addressing.\n\nI think the husband might be in the wrong here because he's pushing to go despite his wife's valid concerns, without fully understanding her anxiety. It's about respecting her feelings and the safety of both the daughter and the unborn child. The wife's trust issues need to be addressed, but the husband should prioritize her well-being and find a compromise, maybe a shorter trip or involving her in the planning to ease her fears. So, Answer A.\n"
