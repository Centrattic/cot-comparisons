I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation where the pregnant wife won't let him take their daughter on a skiing trip. The author feels his wife doesn't trust him or his parents, even though the parents are willing to help. The daughter is almost five, and the author has a history of not being allowed alone with her for long periods.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant and has a history of a miscarriage. That's a significant stressor. Her anxiety about the trip might stem from fear of something happening again. The author mentions that his wife is saying the stress from their fights is making her nervous, which could trigger another miscarriage. That's a real concern from a health standpoint.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he wants to spend time with their daughter, and he feels his wife isn't trusting him. He points out that he's never injured the daughter seriously, just a bruise, and he likes to play energetically. But the wife's refusal might be about more than just the skiing trip. It could be about her ongoing anxiety about the daughter's care and her own pregnancy. The fact that she had a previous miscarriage adds to her vulnerability right now.\n\nThe author is trying to get support from his parents and siblings, but the wife doesn't trust them either. That's a problem. Maybe she feels like the author isn't standing up for her when he could be, as he mentions she says he just follows his parents. The author is caught between wanting to bond with his daughter and respecting his wife's fears.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not physically abusive or negligent, but he might not be considering his wife's emotional state enough. The wife's anxiety could be valid, and the author's insistence on going despite her concerns might be causing her more stress. Also, the fact that they've had 20 fights about this suggests a breakdown in communication. The author might be dismissing her feelings as irrational, not acknowledging her valid fears related to her health and their child's safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is almost five, and the author has some experience, even if limited, with her. The parents are available to help, which could mitigate the wife's worries. But the wife's trust in them isn't there, which is a big issue. The author should perhaps focus on addressing her trust issues rather than just pushing for the trip.\n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not adequately addressing his wife's concerns and is causing her stress during a vulnerable time. But maybe the wife is also being overbearing. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. He's not wrong for wanting to spend time with his daughter, but pressuring his pregnant wife with a history of miscarriage might be wrong if it's causing her harm. So leaning towards A.\n"
