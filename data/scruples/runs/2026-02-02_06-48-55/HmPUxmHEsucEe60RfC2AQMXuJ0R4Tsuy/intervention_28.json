I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe husband wants to take their 5-year-old daughter on a skiing trip, but the wife, who's pregnant, is refusing. The wife has a history of not allowing the husband to be alone with the daughter for long periods, only allowing specific family members like the husband's mother-in-law or kindergarten. Now, even though the daughter is older, the wife is still not trusting the husband or his parents. The husband argues he's never hurt the daughter, just playful and energetic. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is worried this might happen again due to stress from the argument.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the wife's anxiety and past trauma from the miscarriage. The husband is frustrated because he wants to spend time with his daughter without the wife. But the wife's refusal might stem from genuine fear, especially after a miscarriage. She's pregnant again, so stress and anxiety could be higher. Even if the husband thinks he's not doing anything wrong, maybe he's not considering her emotional state enough.\n\nThe wife might feel that her husband isn't supportive or standing up for her. The husband mentions he listens to his parents, which the wife is upset about. If he's not advocating for her in the situation, that could add to her stress. The husband wants to take the daughter, which is natural, but the wife's health and peace of mind are important too, especially during pregnancy.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to spend time with his daughter, but the wife's concerns are valid. Maybe he's not addressing her fears properly. Instead of pushing to take the daughter on the trip, he should work with the wife to find a solution that makes her comfortable. If he's not respecting her feelings and boundaries, that's where he could be wrong. The wife's anxiety is a significant factor here. Even if the husband thinks his intentions are good, he might not be considering her emotional needs, which is part of a healthy relationship. So, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's not addressing her concerns and is causing her stress during a vulnerable time.\n"
