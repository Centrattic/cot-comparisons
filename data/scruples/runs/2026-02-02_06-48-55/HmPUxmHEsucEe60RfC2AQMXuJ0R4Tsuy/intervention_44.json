I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is a father whose wife has been very controlling about him being alone with their daughter. From when the daughter was 2, the wife wouldn't let him have her alone for more than half an hour. It improved slightly when the daughter turned 3, allowing up to 4 hours once for a school event. Now the daughter is almost 5, and a skiing trip was planned. However, after the wife got pregnant (and had a miscarriage a year ago), she's refusing to go on the trip and also denying the author from going with the daughter. The author's parents and brother (with his kids) are available to help, but the wife doesn't trust them. The author argues he's never hurt the daughter, just maybe a bruise from energetic play, and he feels it's his role as a father to play that way. They've had 20 fights about this, and the wife is now pregnant again, which is stressing her out, leading her to believe another miscarriage might happen due to his actions. The author feels his wife isn't supporting him and he's always following her parents' advice instead of standing up for her.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. So, I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nFirst, the wife's perspective: After a previous miscarriage, she's anxious about her current pregnancy. She's been very cautious about the daughter's safety, trusting only the author's parents and kindergarten. Now, she's denying the author from going on the trip, possibly because she's worried about her own health and the daughter's safety. She's also feeling unsupported, as the author seems to be following his parents' suggestions, which might make her feel neglected. Her anxiety is exacerbated by the stress from the author's insistence, which she believes is risking her pregnancy.\n\nFrom the author's side, he feels his parental rights are being restricted. He wants to bond with his daughter through active play, which he considers part of being a father. He's also frustrated that his wife isn't supporting his plans, especially since family is available to help. However, his wife's concerns about the daughter's safety and her own health (due to the previous miscarriage) are valid. The author's energetic play leading to a bruise might be a red flag for the wife, making her distrustful. Also, the fact that they've had 20 fights suggests a communication breakdown.\n\nKey points to consider: The wife's health and the risk of another miscarriage are significant. The author's actions (energetic play causing a bruise) might have contributed to her distrust. The author's insistence on going skiing despite her anxiety could be seen as not prioritizing her well-being. On the other hand, the author is trying to spend time with his daughter, which is a father's right. However, in this context, the wife's medical history and current state might make her position more defensible. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her health and emotional state, especially after a traumatic experience like a miscarriage. His repeated fighting and not standing up for her as she requested could also be seen as exacerbating the problem.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not fully addressing his wife's valid concerns about her health and the daughter's safety, especially given her history. His actions could be inadvertently stressing her, which is risky during her pregnancy. While wanting to bond with the daughter is important, it shouldn't come at the expense of the wife's health. The answer would likely be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
