I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where his pregnant wife\u4e0d\u8ba9 him take their daughter on a skiing trip. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife has a history of not trusting the husband with their daughter alone, even from a young age. She only allowed him alone time when it was a few hours, and now with her pregnancy, especially after a previous miscarriage, she's more anxious. Her concern might stem from past experiences and her current vulnerable state. She's pregnant again, so her stress and fear are higher, which could be affecting her decision-making.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels he's being unfairly restricted. He mentions that he's never harmed the daughter, only a bruise once. He wants to bond with her through energetic play, which he sees as a father's role. He's trying to get support from his parents and brother's family, but the wife doesn't trust even them. The husband feels he's not standing up for her, which might be causing tension in their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The wife's lack of trust in the husband and his family could be rooted in past experiences or her anxiety due to her current pregnancy. The husband, while trying to assert his role as a father, might not be addressing her fears adequately. He might be dismissing her concerns by pointing out his past behavior, which isn't helpful if she's already stressed.\n\nAlso, the wife's history with a miscarriage adds another layer. She might be more cautious now, and the husband's insistence on going could be causing her additional stress, which the doctor might warn against during pregnancy. The fact that they've had this fight 20 times suggests a pattern of conflict where the husband isn't meeting her emotional needs, which is important in a marriage, especially during sensitive times like pregnancy.\n\nThe husband's argument that the in-laws are willing to help might be valid, but if the wife doesn't trust them, that's a red flag. Maybe there's a deeper issue about trust in the family dynamic. The husband might need to consider why the wife doesn't trust his parents and address that, rather than pushing to go skiing.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife's primary concern is the safety and well-being of her daughter and her own health during pregnancy. The husband's desire to bond and enjoy father-daughter time is valid, but it needs to be balanced with her needs. If the husband isn't addressing her fears or working on building trust, then he's not fulfilling his role as a supportive partner. \n\nSo, while the situation is complex, the core issue is the husband not respecting his wife's boundaries and not addressing her valid concerns. Trust is fundamental in a marriage, and if she doesn't trust him with their child, forcing the issue could harm their relationship. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong for not prioritizing his wife's emotional state and safety over his own desires.\n"
