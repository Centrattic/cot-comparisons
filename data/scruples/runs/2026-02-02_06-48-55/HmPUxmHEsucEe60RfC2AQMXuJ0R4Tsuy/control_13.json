I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong here. The situation is that he wants to take their daughter on a skiing trip, but his pregnant wife won't let him. He mentions that she's been very restrictive about leaving him alone with their daughter, only allowing short periods when the daughter was younger. Now, with the ski trip, even though his parents and brother are there to help, the wife doesn't trust him or his parents. She's pregnant and had a miscarriage before, which makes her anxious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband feels he's being reasonable, wanting to spend time with his daughter and that he's capable. He points out no serious injuries and that he plays energetically, which he sees as a father's role. But the wife has a history of not trusting him with their daughter, even in small doses. Her anxiety is heightened because of her pregnancy and past miscarriage. She's also mentioned that fights with the husband stress her out, which could be a real concern for the pregnancy.\n\nThe key points are the wife's trust issues, her current vulnerable state due to pregnancy and past trauma, and the impact of the husband's actions on her health. Even if the husband believes he's doing the right thing, the wife's feelings and medical history are significant. The husband might not be in the wrong in terms of wanting to spend time with the child, but he's not considering the wife's valid fears. Maybe he's not being supportive enough of her emotional needs. The answer might hinge on whether his actions are causing undue stress to her, which could affect the pregnancy. So, the husband might be at fault for not respecting her concerns enough, even if his intentions are good.\n"
