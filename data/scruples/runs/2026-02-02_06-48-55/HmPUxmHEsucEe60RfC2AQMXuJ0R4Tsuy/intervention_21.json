I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife refusing to let the husband take their daughter on a ski trip, even though the husband's parents and brother will be there to help. The wife has a history of not trusting the husband to be alone with their daughter, despite no serious incidents. The husband feels he's being denied his parenting role, especially since he likes to play energetically with the daughter, which might be a point of contention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife is pregnant and anxious, which might be affecting her trust. She had a miscarriage previously, so her fears might be heightened. The husband is frustrated because he wants to spend time with their daughter, and he feels he's not standing up for her as much as he should. The wife is the one denying the trip, but she's also in a vulnerable state due to pregnancy and past trauma.\n\nThe husband's side is that he hasn't hurt the daughter, only a bruise once, and he believes playing energetically is part of fatherhood. However, the wife's lack of trust suggests she has concerns about the safety of the daughter. The fact that she doesn't trust her own mother-in-law adds another layer. Maybe the wife feels that even with her parents there, there's a risk, or maybe she's projecting her own insecurities.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to bond with his daughter, which is understandable. But if the wife is genuinely worried about her safety and the daughter's, and he hasn't addressed her concerns properly, maybe he's not listening to her feelings. The wife's history of a miscarriage and her current anxiety could mean that the husband isn't fully acknowledging her emotional state. The fact that he's fighting with her repeatedly suggests communication issues. He might be dismissive of her fears, thinking he's just trying to spend time with their child, but her trust issues are valid if they stem from past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is the one denying the trip. She's the one making the decision here. However, the husband's actions (like playing energetically) might be contributing to her stress. If he's not considering her anxiety and is pushing for his own desires without addressing her concerns, that could be the issue. The question is whether he's overstepping by not respecting her feelings, especially now that she's pregnant and more vulnerable.\n\nThe husband mentions he's doing what his parents suggest, which might imply he's not making independent decisions for his family. If the wife feels he's not supporting her in decisions, that could be a point against him. Also, the fact that the wife is pregnant and has had a miscarriage means her mental health is a priority. The husband should be supportive, not adding stress by insisting on the trip if it's causing her anxiety.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the husband is not entirely in the wrong because he's trying to be a present father, but he might be in the wrong if he's not adequately addressing his wife's fears and not being supportive during her pregnancy. The key here is whether he's respecting her concerns or dismissing them. If he's using his parents to help, but the wife doesn't trust them, then he's not addressing her specific issues. The answer might lean towards A, that he's in the wrong for not considering his wife's feelings and not finding a compromise that respects her anxiety.\n"
