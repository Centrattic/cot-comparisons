I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the main issue is that the author's wife won't let him take their daughter on a skiing trip, even though their parents and others are available. The wife is pregnant and had a miscarriage before, so she's anxious. The author feels he's being denied his role as a father, especially since he likes to play energetically with the daughter and wants to bond.\n\nThe author's wife has a history of not trusting him with the daughter alone. Even when the daughter was 2, he couldn't be alone with her for more than half an hour. Now, even though the daughter is almost 5, the wife is still not trusting him. The author argues that he's never hurt the daughter, just some bruises from energetic play. But the wife is worried about her pregnancy and the stress from arguments, which she fears might cause another miscarriage.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust issues, the wife's anxiety due to pregnancy and past miscarriage, and the author's desire to spend time with their daughter. The wife's restrictions might stem from past experiences where she felt the daughter wasn't safe with the author. The author might be feeling unfairly treated, especially since others are trusted more than him.\n\nBut the wife's perspective is important. She's pregnant and has a history of a miscarriage. Her anxiety could be affecting her health. If the author is pushing for this trip despite her concerns, that could be causing her stress, which she believes might lead to another miscarriage. However, the author is also a parent who wants to bond with the daughter and might feel his parental role is being diminished.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong in wanting to take the daughter. If the wife's trust is based on real past issues, maybe the author needs to address why she doesn't trust him. But if the author's actions are within reason (like playful but not harmful behavior), then the wife's denial might be overprotective. However, given the wife's medical history, her stress needs to be considered.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is being reasonable about the wife's concerns. If he's dismissing her fears and insisting on going, he might be wrong. But if he's trying to balance his needs with her health, maybe not. The wife not allowing him to take the daughter might be protective, but it's a valid parental right for the author to spend time with the child. However, since the wife is pregnant and the situation is sensitive, the author needs to consider her health. Maybe a compromise would help, like having a parent present during the trip. But as it stands, the wife is the one who set the rules, and the author is challenging them. Since the wife's trust is based on past experiences, the author might need to address why she doesn't trust him and work on building that trust. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her boundaries and the situation, given her pregnancy and past issues. Alternatively, the wife might be overstepping. It's a tough call. But in the context of the story, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the wife's health and stress, leading to repeated arguments that could affect her pregnancy.\n"
