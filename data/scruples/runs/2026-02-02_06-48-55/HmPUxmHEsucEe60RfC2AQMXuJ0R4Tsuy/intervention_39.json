I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the wife is pregnant and doesn't allow the husband to take their daughter on a skiing trip. The husband feels he should be allowed since parents and his brother are there. The wife has trust issues with him and his parents, especially after a previous miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife is pregnant and anxious, which is common, especially after a past miscarriage. Her concerns about the daughter's safety might be heightened. The husband wants to spend quality time with his daughter, but the wife's refusal could be due to her current emotional state and past trauma.\n\nThe husband mentions that he's been allowed limited time alone with the daughter in the past. Now, with the wife pregnant, she's more protective. The husband might feel he's being treated unfairly, but the wife's anxiety and past experience are significant factors. The key here is whether the husband is being unreasonable in his request despite the wife's valid concerns.\n\nThe husband's arguments about his parents and brother being present could be valid, but if the wife doesn't trust them either, that's a problem. The husband's energetic play could be a red flag for the wife, even if it's normal father-daughter interaction. The wife's fear of another miscarriage due to stress adds another layer of complexity.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong for pushing despite her anxiety? Or is the wife overreacting due to her pregnancy and past trauma? The husband's perspective is about his rights as a father, but the wife's mental health and valid fears can't be ignored. The answer might depend on communication and whether the husband is respecting her boundaries. If he's not considering her emotional state and is pressuring her, that could be the issue. Alternatively, if the wife is being overly controlling without good reason, that's different. But given her history, it's possible she's acting out of fear rather than being unreasonable. So maybe the husband is in the wrong because he's not validating her feelings and is insisting on his way, which adds stress to her pregnancy. Therefore, answer A.\n"
