I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband wants to take their daughter on a ski trip, but the wife, who's pregnant and had a miscarriage before, won't let him. The parents and other family are there to help, but she doesn't trust them. The husband is frustrated because he's being denied the chance to spend time with his daughter, especially since the wife isn't going because of her pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's concerns: she's pregnant, had a miscarriage, and is worried about stress affecting the pregnancy. Her not trusting the husband or his parents to care for their daughter is a big issue here. The husband feels he's being unfairly restricted and wants to be the fun, active dad with the daughter. But maybe the wife's anxiety is justified, especially after a miscarriage. She might be overprotective, but her health and the new baby's well-being are important.\n\nThen there's the fact that the wife has been controlling the daughter's time with the husband and parents in the past. The husband mentions he was never allowed alone with the daughter for long periods. That seems restrictive. Now, with the ski trip, maybe the wife is extending that control, not allowing the husband to bond with the daughter in a different environment. But her current state of pregnancy and past trauma might be influencing her decisions heavily.\n\nThe husband is pushing for his parental rights, wanting to spend time with his daughter. But he also needs to consider his wife's mental and physical health. If her anxiety is real and stemming from a previous loss, forcing the issue might not be the best approach. However, the wife isn't justifying her stance with specific, current dangers but more on her lack of trust, which might be about control rather than the child's safety. The fact that other family members are available to help could be a point in favor of the husband's argument.\n\nBut the key here is whether the husband is in the wrong. He wants to spend time with his daughter, but the wife's denial might be causing her stress, which could affect her pregnancy. However, if the wife's refusal is based on unfounded distrust, that's a problem. On the other hand, if she's genuinely scared for the daughter's safety without the wife present, maybe there's a valid concern. The husband's energetic play is mentioned, but it's noted that the daughter's only injury was a bruise, which seems minor. So maybe the wife's fears are exaggerated.\n\nAlso, the wife's claim that the husband always follows his parents' advice and doesn't stand up for her could indicate a pattern of the husband not asserting his own views, which might have contributed to this situation. But in this case, he's trying to take a stand, which is a positive step. However, the repeated fights suggest communication issues. The husband might not be considering the wife's emotional state enough, but the wife's refusal might be overbearing.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the wife's health and past trauma are valid, but the husband's need for bonding with the daughter is also important. If the wife is denying the trip without a reasonable safety concern, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. But if her stress from the situation could harm her pregnancy, then he might be overstepping. The answer depends on whether the wife's refusal is reasonable. Since the daughter's safety hasn't been compromised before, and other family is present, the husband's request might be valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. The wife's lack of trust in the parents could be a red flag, but if they're willing to help, maybe her refusal is unnecessary. So I think the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
