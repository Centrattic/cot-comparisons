I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a pregnant wife who refuses to let her husband take their daughter on a skiing trip with the grandparents and other relatives. The husband feels he should be allowed to go since he's been trusted more over time and the parents are available.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's perspective: she had a miscarriage a year ago and is now pregnant again. She's anxious about her health and the baby's. She doesn't trust the husband or his parents to take care of their daughter, even though there haven't been any serious injuries. Her refusal to go skiing is understandable due to her condition, but she's also preventing the husband from taking their daughter. Her past trauma might make her overprotective.\n\nThe husband's side: He's been trying to get more time alone with their daughter, which is normal for a father. He wants to go on the trip, and the parents and brother are available to help. He's frustrated because he feels his wife isn't trusting him, even though he hasn't done anything to harm the daughter. He mentions playing energetically, which the wife might see as risky.\n\nI should consider the impact of the wife's past miscarriage on her current anxiety. Her trust issues are valid given her history. The husband might be pushing for his own desires without fully considering her emotional state. Even if he's a good father, her feelings about the safety of their daughter and her own stress from pregnancy need to be respected.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband is prioritizing his own needs over his wife's well-being and fears. If he's pushing hard despite her valid concerns, he might be in the wrong. The wife's anxiety isn't just about distrust but also past trauma. The husband's insistence on taking the daughter could be causing her unnecessary stress, which could be harmful during pregnancy.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is almost 5 and the parents are available. The husband wants to bond with her, which is a natural desire. But if the wife's refusal is based on her legitimate fears and past experiences, the husband needs to find a compromise that respects her feelings. Maybe finding a middle ground where the daughter can have some time with him under supervision or adjusting the plans to accommodate both parents' needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not fully addressing his wife's emotional state and past trauma. He should prioritize her well-being and their daughter's safety, even if it means adjusting his own plans. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
