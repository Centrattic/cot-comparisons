I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole because their pregnant wife won't let them take their daughter on a skiing trip. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is now pregnant again, so she's probably very anxious about it. The user says their wife has never trusted them or their parents with their daughter, even when they were allowed to have the kid for a few hours. Now, they want to go skiing with their daughter and parents, but the wife is refusing. The user is frustrated because they never had serious accidents with the daughter, just a bruise once. They also mention they like to play energetically, which they see as part of being a dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's perspective is important here. She's pregnant, which can make her more anxious about her health and the baby's. She had a miscarriage before, so her fear of losing another child might be intense. Her not trusting the husband with their daughter could stem from past experiences where she felt the daughter's safety was at risk. Even if the husband hasn't caused major injuries, the wife's perception of risk might be high. The fact that she's fighting with him 20 times over this and it's affecting her pregnancy is a red flag. If her stress could lead to complications, then her stance is more about protecting both herself and the unborn child.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels he's not being trusted, even though he's proven he can handle their daughter. He wants to spend time with her, which is a natural desire. The parents are available to help, which should ease the wife's concerns. But maybe the issue isn't just about trust. The wife might have deeper insecurities or past experiences that make her not trust the parents either. The husband's admission that he plays energetically might be a point of contention. If the wife perceives that as a risk, even if it's not serious, she might be overreacting out of fear.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. The key factors here are the wife's anxiety due to pregnancy and history of miscarriage, the husband's frustration over not being trusted, and the potential stress on the wife. The husband's actions (wanting to take the daughter skiing) might be seen as reasonable, but the wife's refusal is driven by her anxiety for both her and the baby's health. If the husband is pushing despite the wife's concerns, he might not be considering her mental and physical state adequately. However, the wife's lack of trust in the parents and her husband's ability could be part of a larger issue, like control or past experiences.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting to take the daughter on the trip. If the wife's refusal is based on valid health concerns and her history, then maybe the husband is not wrong. But if he's not addressing her fears and is being dismissive, that could be problematic. The fact that fights are increasing and affecting the wife's pregnancy suggests that the husband might need to back down to protect her well-being. The wife's priority is her health and the baby's, so the husband's desire might have to be set aside temporarily. The husband might not be in the wrong about wanting to go, but he might be in the wrong about not respecting his wife's feelings and health during this critical time.\n"
