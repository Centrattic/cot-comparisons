I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife not allowing the husband to take their daughter on a skiing trip. The husband says the wife has always been strict about him being alone with the daughter, only allowing it for short periods when the daughter was younger. Now that the daughter is almost 5, and the wife is pregnant, she's refusing to let him go on the trip even with family there to help. The husband is frustrated, saying they had fights, and the wife is worried about her health due to the stress from the previous miscarriage.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the wife's trust issues, the history of the wife not trusting the husband with the daughter, and the current pregnancy affecting her stress levels. The husband mentions that the daughter's injuries are minimal, but he does play energetic with her, which might be a point of contention for the wife. Also, the wife feels he's not standing up for her and is influenced too much by his parents.\n\nI think the wife's concerns are valid, especially after a miscarriage. Her stress and anxiety about the pregnancy could be making her more protective. The husband wants to take the daughter on a trip, but the wife's refusal might stem from fear of something happening if he's not there. However, the husband might be in the right if he's trying to bond with his daughter and the wife is being overly restrictive. But the wife's health has to be considered. Maybe the husband is not in the wrong because he's trying to be a good father and the wife's refusal is causing unnecessary stress. But then again, the wife's safety and mental health during pregnancy are important. It's a tough balance. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe there's more nuance. The answer might hinge on whether the wife's restrictions are reasonable given her history and current state. If the husband isn't actually a risk, then the wife's refusal could be unreasonable, but if her health is at stake, then she has a valid reason. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the wife's actions are causing stress and the husband is acting in good faith to spend time with his daughter.\n"
