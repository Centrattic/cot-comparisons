I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong here. The main issue is that his pregnant wife won't let him take their daughter on a ski trip, even though his parents and brother's family are there to help. The wife has a history of not trusting him to be alone with their daughter, only allowing short periods. Now that she's pregnant, she's more anxious, especially after a past miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant and vulnerable, which can heighten anxiety. The fact that she had a miscarriage adds to her stress. Her refusal might stem from fear rather than mistrust. She might be worried that any stress from arguments or the trip could risk another miscarriage. Even if the husband feels he's being reasonable, the wife's emotional state is significant here.\n\nOn the husband's side, he's trying to bond with his daughter through skiing, which he sees as a fatherly role. He mentions he's never injured the daughter and plays energetically, which is normal. He's also frustrated because his parents and brother's family are available to help. But the wife doesn't trust even the parents, which is a key point. If she doesn't trust her in-laws either, that complicates things. \n\nThe husband might be in a good position where he's doing what he can, but the wife's anxiety is valid. He needs to consider her emotional and physical health during pregnancy. Repeated arguments aren't helping and might be exacerbating her stress. Even if he thinks he's right, the way he's approaching this could be causing her more harm. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's not a straightforward yes or no. But from a supportive standpoint, he needs to prioritize her well-being and communication. The answer here would lean towards him not being in the wrong (B) because he's trying to spend time with his daughter, but he might need to adjust his approach. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given the circumstances, maybe he's not in the wrong, but he could be handling it better. The AITA context often looks at intent and circumstances. Since he's not hurting the child and is trying to bond, and the wife's anxiety is a valid factor, the answer might be B.\n"
