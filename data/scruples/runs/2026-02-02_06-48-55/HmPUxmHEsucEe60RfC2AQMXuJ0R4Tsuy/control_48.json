I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a pregnant wife not allowing her husband to take their daughter on a skiing trip. The husband says his wife has never trusted him with the daughter alone, even when the daughter was 2, and only allowed him 4 hours when she was 3. Now, with the wife pregnant again, she's refusing to let him take the daughter to the ski trip, even though his parents and brother will be there. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is worried it might happen again. The husband is frustrated because he feels like he's not trusted and he wants to spend time with his daughter.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife's perspective: she's pregnant again after a miscarriage, which is a traumatic experience. Her anxiety is high, and she's worried that the stress from the husband pushing to take the daughter could cause another miscarriage. She doesn't trust him to be alone with the daughter, which might stem from past experiences or her own insecurities. Her denial of the trip could be due to genuine fear for her health and the baby's, as well as maybe not wanting to leave the daughter in someone else's care, even if there's family present.\n\nOn the husband's side, he feels unfairly restricted. He's been allowed more time with the daughter as she's grown, but now the wife is denying him this trip. He mentions he's never injured the daughter, just a bruise, and he wants to have energetic playtime, which is typical for a father-daughter bond. He's also getting into frequent fights with his wife, which is stressing both of them out, especially her due to her pregnancy.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he wants to spend time with his daughter, which is normal, but he needs to consider his wife's current health and emotional state. The wife's refusal might be protective but also possibly overprotective. The husband might be pushing too hard, not respecting her boundaries during a vulnerable time. However, he's not doing anything dangerous\u2014just wanting to play energetically. The wife's lack of trust in him and his parents could be an issue, but maybe she's not communicating her fears properly.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's health and the potential stress of pregnancy, her past miscarriage, and her anxiety about the husband's actions. The husband's desire to bond with his daughter is valid, but he needs to prioritize his wife's well-being. If he's causing her stress through arguments and insistence, that's problematic. The fact that she's pregnant and had a miscarriage suggests that stress could be a real factor. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not considering the impact of his actions on his wife's health and for not resolving the conflict without causing her distress. On the other hand, the wife might be overreacting, but given her circumstances, her actions are somewhat understandable.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the husband being in the wrong here because he's not respecting his wife's health concerns and is causing her stress, which could be detrimental to her pregnancy. Even if his intentions are good, the method of pushing for the trip without considering her state is inappropriate. So, the answer is A.\n"
