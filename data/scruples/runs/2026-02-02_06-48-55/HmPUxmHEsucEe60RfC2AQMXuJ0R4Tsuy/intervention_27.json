I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where his pregnant wife won't let him take their daughter on a ski trip. The author feels that he's been allowed more time with their daughter before, and now with the wife being pregnant, he's being denied again. The wife is concerned about the daughter's safety and her own health due to the stress, especially after a previous miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's been allowed time with their daughter before, and he wants to bond with her while the wife is pregnant. The wife, on the other hand, has valid reasons for her anxiety. She had a miscarriage, so she's worried about her current pregnancy. She doesn't trust the husband or his parents with the daughter, and she's not alone in this concern. The daughter's safety is important, and the wife's mental health during pregnancy is crucial too. \n\nThe husband mentions he likes to play energetically with their daughter, which the wife might see as a risk. Even if he hasn't caused injuries before, the wife's past experience (the miscarriage) might make her more cautious. Her anxiety could be affecting her trust in him, even if he's tried to be responsible. The fact that she's pregnant and had a previous miscarriage adds a layer of sensitivity here. \n\nThe husband is trying to argue that the parents will be there to help, but the wife doesn't trust his parents either. That's a problem because she's not just worried about him; maybe she has issues with her own family's ability to care for the daughter. The husband might not be realizing that her refusal isn't just about him, but about a combination of her current state, past trauma, and lack of trust in multiple people who would be involved in the trip. \n\nHe's also fighting with her repeatedly, which could be increasing her stress. Since she's pregnant, excessive stress is bad for both her and the baby. The husband might not be considering that his insistence could be exacerbating her anxiety. He might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her feelings and the reasons behind her refusal. Even if he feels he's being reasonable, her emotional state and health should be a priority. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband wants to spend time with their daughter, which is a natural desire. However, the key here is whether his actions are respecting his wife's boundaries and her health. If he's not willing to back off or find alternative solutions that make her comfortable, he might be overstepping. The fact that she's pregnant and had a miscarriage means her concerns are more valid and should be taken seriously. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong not because he wants to go skiing, but because he's not adequately addressing his wife's valid concerns and is causing her stress. The wife's health and mental state are important, and pushing her on this could be harmful. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
