I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife refusing to let the husband take their daughter on a skiing trip, even though the parents-in-law and other family are there. The husband feels he's being treated unfairly, especially since the parents are available. The wife has a history of a miscarriage and is now worried that stress might cause another one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband wants to spend quality time with his daughter and trusts his parents to help. The wife, being pregnant, is anxious and has trust issues. She might be overprotective due to her past experience. The husband mentions he didn't have much solo time with their daughter before, so maybe he's feeling deprived now. But the wife's health and safety are also important, especially given her history.\n\nIs the wife's refusal justified? If she's genuinely fearing stress could lead to another miscarriage, maybe she's not wrong to be cautious. But does the husband have a valid point about his role and the availability of other family? He plays a more energetic role with the daughter, which is normal for a father. Not allowing him to go might affect their relationship and the daughter's bond with him.\n\nThe key points are the wife's health and the husband's parental role. The husband might be in a bind because he's being denied something he wants for his daughter, but the wife's anxiety is real. However, is he in the wrong? If he's not harming the daughter and the parents are available, maybe the wife is being overly restrictive. But the wife's fear is valid given her past. The fight frequency suggests communication issues. The husband might be overreacting by fighting repeatedly, which could stress her more. The wife's trust issues could stem from past experiences or the miscarriage. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on balancing the husband's parental rights and the wife's health concerns. If the husband isn't endangering the daughter and the parents can help, maybe the wife is being unreasonable. However, considering her pregnancy and trauma, it's a tough call. The husband should probably communicate better and find a compromise, but is he in the wrong? Maybe not, but the situation is complex. I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to spend time with his daughter and the wife's restrictions might be excessive, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
