I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The setup is that the husband wants to take their daughter on a ski trip with his parents and brother's family, but the pregnant wife won't allow it. She's been very strict about not leaving the daughter with him or his parents before. Now, with her being pregnant and having had a miscarriage, she's more anxious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband feels he's a good father, never hurt the daughter, and wants to bond with her by playing energetically. He's frustrated because he's been allowed to be with her only briefly before. The wife, on the other hand, has a history of not trusting him or his parents. She's pregnant, which can increase anxiety, especially after a miscarriage. Her concern might be about the safety of both her current pregnancy and their daughter.\n\nThe key points here are trust issues, the wife's mental health due to pregnancy and past trauma, and the husband's desire to have quality time with his daughter. The husband wants to take the daughter to a ski trip with his parents and brother's family, which seems like a family event. But the wife's refusal isn't just about the ski trip; it's about her deep-seated trust in him and her parents-in-law. \n\nI should also consider if there's any history of the husband not being responsible. He says he's never hurt the daughter, but the wife's past actions (not letting him have her for long) suggest she has valid concerns. Maybe the wife feels that even a small injury could trigger another miscarriage, given her history. Her anxiety is legitimate, and the husband might not fully grasp how her past affects her current decisions.\n\nThe husband might be in the right if he's being a responsible father, but the wife's mental health and fear of another miscarriage are significant factors. He's not wrong for wanting to bond with his daughter, but he might need to find a middle ground. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and considering the wife's justified anxiety and the history of distrust, the answer might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong, but there's nuance. However, the fact that the wife is pregnant and has a past miscarriage, and her refusal is based on her anxiety, which the husband might not be addressing properly. But he's trying to spend time with his daughter, which is a valid need.\n\nWait, but the wife's actions are affecting her current health because of stress from the husband's insistence. The husband might not be considering her mental state enough. But he's also trying to be a present father. It's a tough balance. If he's being reasonable and the wife's refusal is causing her harm, maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe he should be more accommodating given her situation. \n\nHmm. The key here is that the wife is denying him time with their daughter, but her reasoning is based on her anxiety from past trauma and current pregnancy. If the husband is acting in good faith and the wife is being unreasonable, he might not be at fault. However, if he's ignoring her valid concerns, he might be. But since he has no history of harm, maybe the wife is overreacting. But given her miscarriage history and current pregnancy, her fear is understandable. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the husband wants quality time with his daughter, which is important for bonding. The wife is worried about her health and the daughter's safety. The author's actions aren't malicious, but the wife's refusal is due to her mental health. It's a complex situation where both have valid points. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he's not harming the daughter and is trying to be a present father, maybe he's not in the wrong. But he's not considering her mental health enough. However, the answer choices are A (yes) or B (no). Given that the author isn't at fault for wanting to spend time with his daughter and has no history of harming her, I think the answer is B (no). But I need to check if there's any aspect I missed. The wife's refusal is causing her stress, which could affect her pregnancy. The husband should try to find a compromise, but he's not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to take the trip. So the answer is B.\n"
