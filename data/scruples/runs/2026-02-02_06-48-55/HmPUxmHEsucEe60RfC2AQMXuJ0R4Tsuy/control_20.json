I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a pregnant wife not allowing the husband to take their daughter on a skiing trip, even though the parents and the brother are available to help. The husband feels it's unfair since he's never hurt the child and they've been planning this trip for months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She's pregnant, which is a vulnerable time, and she had a miscarriage previously. That adds stress and anxiety. Her not wanting to go skiing is understandable, but the main issue is her not trusting the husband and his parents with the daughter. The husband says he's never injured the kid, just plays energetic, which he thinks is part of fatherhood. The wife might see that play as too rough, leading to her lack of trust. \n\nThe husband is planning to be with the daughter at the ski trip, but the wife is denying him. The parents and brother are there to help, but she doesn't trust them either. The husband is frustrated because he feels he's doing what he's told by his parents, not standing up for her. But he's also in a situation where he wants to spend time with his daughter, which is a valid desire.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's trying to have a family activity that's been planned, and he's not harming the child. But he might be pushing too hard, not considering his wife's emotional state after the miscarriage. The wife's anxiety could be legitimate, and if the husband keeps insisting, it might exacerbate her stress, which could affect her pregnancy. \n\nHowever, the wife's refusal to allow any time with the daughter without her might be over-protective. The husband's right to bond with his child is important. But given the context of her recent pregnancy and past miscarriage, her actions might be a result of trauma. The key here is whether the husband is being unreasonable. He's not doing anything harmful, but he's also not backing down, leading to repeated fights. \n\nMaybe the husband isn't in the wrong, but he could be more empathetic. The wife might be in the wrong for not trusting the husband and his family, but her reasons are rooted in past experiences. It's a complex situation. The answer might be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not harming the child and is trying to bond with her. But I'm not 100% sure. The wife's mental health is a factor too. The husband might need to find a middle ground, but he's not necessarily at fault.\n"
