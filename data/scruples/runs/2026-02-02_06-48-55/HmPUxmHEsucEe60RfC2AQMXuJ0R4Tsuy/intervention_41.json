I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband wanting to take their 5-year-old daughter on a ski trip with his parents and brother's family, but the wife, who's pregnant, refuses to let him go. She's worried about the daughter's safety, citing past issues where she wasn't allowed to leave him alone with the kid even for short periods. The husband feels trusted now and wants to go, but the wife is nervous, especially after a miscarriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband argues that he's a good father, with no serious injuries to the daughter except a bruise, and that he plays energetically, which he sees as his role. He's frustrated because he's been trying to get the approval to take the daughter alone for years. The wife, on the other hand, has legitimate reasons for her anxiety\u2014previous reluctance to leave the daughter with him and a recent pregnancy after a miscarriage. Her denial might be protective, but it's causing conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here: the wife's mental health and the daughter's safety. The husband wants to take the daughter, but the wife is adamant. The husband's parents and brother are available as alternatives, but the wife doesn't trust them either. The husband's frustration is understandable, but the wife's concerns shouldn't be dismissed. The fact that the wife has a history of not trusting him with the daughter alone adds weight to her current anxiety. Also, her past miscarriage complicates her current emotional state.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? The author is asking if he's at fault. The husband wants to bond with his daughter, which is valid. However, the wife's refusal might stem from valid concerns, even if they seem irrational. The husband could be in the wrong if he's pushing too hard without considering her emotional state, especially during pregnancy. But maybe he's not in the wrong because he's trying to spend time with his daughter. But the wife's safety and emotional well-being are also important. The husband needs to address her fears and find a compromise, maybe not pushing for the trip if she's that anxious. However, he's also a parent who wants to spend time with his child. It's a tough balance. The author's actions might not be wrong, but the wife's perspective is valid. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the wife's concerns are valid and the husband isn't respecting her feelings, then he might be in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
