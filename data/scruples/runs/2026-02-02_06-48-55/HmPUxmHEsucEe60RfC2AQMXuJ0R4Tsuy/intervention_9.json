I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong here. The situation is that he wants to take their daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and siblings, but his wife, who's pregnant, is refusing to let him go. She doesn't trust him or her parents to take care of the daughter. The wife had a miscarriage before and is worried it might happen again because of the stress from the argument.\n\nFirst, the wife's concerns might be valid. After a miscarriage, pregnancy can be stressful, and it's understandable she's anxious. She might be overprotective, but her fear is real. The husband, on the other hand, feels he's being fair because the daughter adores his parents and brother, and he's been allowed to take her before.\n\nBut the key points here are trust and the wife's mental health. The wife doesn't trust the husband or his parents, which is a big deal. Trust is crucial in a relationship. If she's not trusting him, pushing for this trip could cause more stress for her, which isn't good for her pregnancy. Also, the husband mentions they've fought 20 times about this. Constant arguing isn't healthy, especially when one partner is pregnant and vulnerable.\n\nHe wants to spend time with his daughter, which is important, but he needs to consider his wife's feelings and health. Maybe there's a middle ground, like a shorter trip or involving someone else to help. However, he's insisting despite her objections. That seems selfish. The wife's emotional state should be a priority here. \n\nThe husband's defense about not hurting the daughter before might not matter if the wife doesn't trust him now. Trust issues can't be dismissed with past behavior. Also, he's being told he always follows his parents' advice, which might make his wife feel she's not being supported. So, he's not standing up for her, which is part of the problem.\n\nSo, putting it together, the husband is pushing his own desire despite his wife's valid concerns and stress from her past. That makes him the one in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
