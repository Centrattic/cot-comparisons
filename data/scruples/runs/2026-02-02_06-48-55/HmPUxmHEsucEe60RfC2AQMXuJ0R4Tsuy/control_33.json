I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting to take his daughter skiing while his pregnant wife refuses to go. \n\nFirst, the wife has a history of not trusting the husband with their daughter alone. From the daughter being 2 to 3 years old, she wasn't allowed alone with him for more than half an hour. Now the daughter is almost 5, and a skiing trip was planned. The wife got pregnant, and she's refusing to go, which is understandable given her condition. However, she's also denying the husband from going with the daughter, even though the parents and brother are willing to help. The wife is worried about the risk of another miscarriage due to stress and doesn't trust the husband or his parents with the daughter.\n\nThe husband argues that he's never harmed the daughter, just playfully energetic. He's trying to bond with her as a father. They've had multiple arguments, and the wife's anxiety is exacerbated by her pregnancy and past miscarriage.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust issues and the wife's health. The wife's refusal might be based on her anxiety and fear of losing another child, which is valid. The husband's frustration is about not being trusted and wanting to spend time with his daughter. But is he in the wrong? \n\nThe wife's trust in her husband's ability to care for their daughter seems to be the main issue. If the husband has never actually harmed the child, maybe the wife's distrust is unfounded. However, her anxiety due to pregnancy and past trauma is significant. The husband might be pushing too hard, not considering her emotional state. \n\nBut since the wife is pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, her health and mental state are critical. The husband's arguments about parental bonding might be valid, but he needs to prioritize his wife's well-being. Repeated arguments could be stressing her out, which is dangerous. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is denying him access to their daughter based on past distrust, which might not be justified if there's no evidence of harm. The husband's parents and brother are available, so maybe the problem is about trust in him specifically. \n\nI think the wife's anxiety is a valid concern here. The husband might not be in the wrong for wanting to spend time with his daughter, but he might be missing the point of his wife's fears. The answer hinges on whether the husband is respecting his wife's emotional state and seeking alternative solutions instead of pushing for his own desires. Since the wife is pregnant and vulnerable, the husband's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, even if his intentions are good. So maybe he is in the wrong for not fully supporting his wife's needs and mental health.\n"
