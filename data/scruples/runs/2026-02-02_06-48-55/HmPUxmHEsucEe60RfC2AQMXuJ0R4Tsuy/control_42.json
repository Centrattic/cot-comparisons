I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario is about a husband planning a skiing trip with his daughter while his pregnant wife refuses to let him go. The wife has a history of not allowing him alone with their daughter, even when she was younger. Now, with the wife pregnant again, she's denying him taking the daughter on the trip even though her parents and brother's family are there. The author is frustrated because he feels his wife doesn't trust him or his parents, and he's been arguing a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's perspective. She had a miscarriage a year ago and is now pregnant again, which adds stress. Her fear of losing another child might make her more anxious. The fact that she doesn't want to let the daughter go on the trip could stem from her anxiety. She might think that having her husband away could increase her stress, which she believes might lead to another miscarriage. Also, her past behavior of not allowing the husband alone with the daughter suggests she has safety concerns about him being responsible for her. Even if the injury was minor, maybe she feels he's too rough when playing.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband feels he's not being trusted and is trying to be a fun father by playing energetically. He's trying to make plans for the family, and the trip is already planned. His parents and brother's family are available to help, so maybe he's right in thinking the daughter is well-cared for. The wife's refusal is leading to constant arguments, which isn't healthy, especially with her pregnancy.\n\nNow, the key points are the wife's anxiety due to her past miscarriage and her current pregnancy, her lack of trust in the husband and his parents, versus the husband's need for independence and trust. The husband isn't abusive, just playful, but maybe the wife's fear is valid because she's been through trauma. The husband isn't standing up for her, according to her, which complicates things.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his actions are reasonable. Since the wife's concerns are real and based on her past, the husband might not be in the wrong for wanting to take the daughter, but he might not be considering her anxiety enough. However, the wife's refusal is due to her legitimate fears. The husband's frustration is understandable, but he needs to address her feelings. So maybe the answer is that the husband isn't in the wrong, but the wife's perspective is valid. Alternatively, if the husband isn't compromising enough, maybe he is. But given the information, the wife's anxiety is a significant factor, so the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
