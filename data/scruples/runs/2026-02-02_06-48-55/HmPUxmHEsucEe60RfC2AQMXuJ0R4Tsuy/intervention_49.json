I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation involves a pregnant wife who won't let him take their daughter on a ski trip. The wife has a history of not trusting the author or his parents with their daughter, and there's a miscarriage from a year ago that's mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife is pregnant and doesn't want to go skiing. The author wants to take their daughter, with the support of his parents and brother's family. The wife is resistant, citing trust issues and that arguments are making her nervous, which might lead to another miscarriage. The author feels he's being reasonable, as the kid is almost 5 and the parents are there. But the wife is very strict about not letting him be alone with the daughter, even from when she was 2. The author mentions he's never injured the kid, just a bruise from energetic play.\n\nSo, the main issue is about parental trust and the wife's anxiety. The author is frustrated because he's being denied what he thinks is a normal father-daughter activity, especially with family support. But the wife's resistance could stem from past trauma (the miscarriage) and a deep mistrust. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to consider both sides. The wife's mental health and her fear of another miscarriage are significant factors. If the author is causing her stress through arguments, that could be harmful. On the other hand, the author is trying to spend time with his daughter in a supervised setting with family present.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is overstepping by pushing despite his wife's concerns. The wife's trust in him is low, and even if he's not abusive, her perception matters. The author might be trying to do his \"fatherly role,\" but if his actions are causing her distress, which could affect her pregnancy, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, the author's past behavior of not being alone with the daughter even when she was older might contribute to the wife's lack of trust. The author might not realize that his wife's anxiety is real and needs to be respected, even if he feels he's being reasonable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the wife's health is at risk due to the author's insistence, then he might be in the wrong by not accommodating her emotional needs. It's about balancing the father's desire to bond with the child and the mother's well-being. The author's arguments about the parents' presence might not alleviate the wife's trust issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his wife's emotional state and her justified fears, even if he has good intentions. The wife's health and mental state are critical, especially after a miscarriage. The author should be more sensitive to her needs rather than pushing for his own agenda."
