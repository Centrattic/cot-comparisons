I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the husband wants to take their daughter on a ski trip, but the pregnant wife won't allow it. The key points to consider are the wife's past behavior regarding leaving the daughter with the husband, the recent pregnancy, the history of a miscarriage, and the tension between the couple.\n\nFirst, the wife has been very cautious about leaving the daughter with the husband. Even when the daughter was older (around 2 or 3), she wasn't allowed alone with him for long. Now that the wife is pregnant and has a history of a miscarriage, her anxiety might be higher. She's worried that the stress from the husband's insistence on going on the trip could lead to another miscarriage. This seems like a valid health concern, especially during pregnancy.\n\nThe author mentions he's never hurt the daughter, only a bruise once. He likes to play energetically, which might be normal for a father, but the wife's lack of trust is a problem. The wife might not feel that the husband is responsible enough with their child, hence not trusting him. Also, she's accusing him of always following his parents' advice instead of standing up for her. This indicates a pattern of conflict in their relationship regarding child-rearing decisions.\n\nThe husband wants to take the daughter with his parents and brother, but the wife doesn't trust his parents either. There's a lot of stress here, and the wife's health (both mental and physical) is a factor. The husband might not be considering how his actions are affecting her pregnancy. Even if his intentions are good, if his wife's stress could lead to complications, he might need to prioritize her well-being over his desire to go skiing.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is almost 5, and maybe old enough for some independence. The husband's desire to bond with her through an activity like skiing is understandable. But the wife's concerns, especially with the recent pregnancy and past miscarriage, seem significant. The fact that she's having recurring fights and it's getting worse due to her pregnancy suggests that her emotional state is fragile.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If the wife's health and the pregnancy are at risk, then the husband might need to compromise. However, if he's been a responsible parent and the wife's lack of trust is unfounded, maybe she's overstepping. But given the context of her pregnancy complications and past trauma, her anxiety seems justified. Therefore, the husband might be in the right to want to go skiing but might not be considering the wife's health enough, making him partially at fault. However, the main issue is her health and the pregnancy, so he might need to back down to protect her, meaning he's not entirely in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
