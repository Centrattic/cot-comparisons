I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants to take his daughter on a ski trip, but the pregnant wife won't let him. The wife had a miscarriage a year ago and is now very anxious, fearing another one because the husband is pushing to go skiing. The author feels he's being treated unfairly since he's a good father and the in-laws are willing to help. But the wife is the one setting the boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband argues that he's a good parent, has never hurt the kid, and wants to bond with her. But the wife is pregnant and has a history of miscarriage, so her anxiety might be valid. She's not trusting him or his parents with the daughter, which is a big deal. The husband is pushing despite her concerns, leading to multiple fights, which is causing her stress. That stress could be harmful to her pregnancy.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's health and safety during her pregnancy. If her anxiety is leading her to believe that this could cause another miscarriage, and her stress is real, then the husband needs to respect that. Even if he thinks he's being reasonable, her emotional and physical state is the priority. The husband might feel he's being denied a father-daughter bonding trip, but the wife's well-being comes first here. Also, she's the primary caregiver, and her trust issues might stem from past experiences or her current vulnerable state. The husband's insistence could be seen as not considering her feelings and health, which are crucial. So, even if the husband's intentions are good, he's not respecting her boundaries and her health, making him at fault.\n"
