I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband wants to take their daughter on a skiing trip with his parents and his brother's family. But the wife, who recently got pregnant after a miscarriage, is refusing to let the husband take the daughter alone. The wife doesn't trust the husband or his parents with the daughter. The husband argues he's never hurt the kid, just play a bit energetic, which he thinks is his role as a father. They've had 20 fights about this, and the wife is getting more anxious because of her pregnancy after a previous miscarriage.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the wife's trust issues and her anxiety due to her pregnancy. The husband feels wronged because he's been given limited time with the daughter before and now can't take her on the trip. But the wife's main concern is about the daughter's safety and her own health. She's pregnant again after a miscarriage, which probably makes her more sensitive about stress and risks. \n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole. From what I read, the wife's refusal might stem from genuine fear and past trauma (the miscarriage) combined with not trusting the husband or his parents with the daughter. The husband wants to bond with the daughter in a certain way (energetic play), but the wife is worried about the daughter's safety. The fact that the wife has a history of not allowing the husband alone with the daughter suggests that her concerns aren't new. Maybe the husband hasn't addressed her trust issues properly. Also, he's arguing about taking the daughter on the trip despite her being pregnant and having had a miscarriage, which could be causing her stress.\n\nSo, even though the husband thinks he's being reasonable, the wife's mental and physical health during pregnancy is a significant factor here. The husband's insistence might be contributing to her stress, which could affect her current pregnancy. The wife might believe that the trip with the parents and brother's family is safer for both the daughter and the unborn child. The husband's repeated arguments might be exacerbating her anxiety, which isn't helping their situation. Therefore, maybe the husband is in the wrong by not validating her feelings and not considering her health and stress levels. The answer might be A, but I need to check if there's a counterpoint. The husband does mention he hasn't injured the daughter, but maybe the wife's fear is about the energetic play, not physical harm. Also, the husband's desire to bond with the daughter is valid, but should it override the wife's health concerns? It's a tough balance, but given the wife's history and current state, the husband might be in the wrong here for not respecting her boundaries and the potential impact on her pregnancy.\n"
