I was never allowed alone with her for more then half hour when she was 2 or so. I was happy when I was allowed about 4 hours at 3 years old when wife had a school anniversary. Only my mother in-law and kindergarten are allowed with her for extended periods of time. My daughter is almost 5 now, and a skiing trip was planned a few months ago.\n\nA few weeks ago my wife got pregnant, and we're very happy because we always wanted a sibling for the daughter. Now my wife doesn't want to go skiing, which is understandable with her state.\n\nBut she is denying me to go with my daughter. My parents are going to be there, and they will be more then happy to help. My brother with his children will be there. My daughter adores them and my parents. But none of this will help with my wife, she doesn't trust me or my parents with her.\n\nI never injured my daughter, the biggest injury she ever had was a bruise. I do like to play a bit energetic with her, I believe it's the fathers role to do that.\n\nI had a fight with my wife for the 20th time about the same subject, but she is pregnant now so it's worse. She had a miscarriage a year ago, and she is saying it will happen again because I'm making her nervous. She says I'm always doing what my parents tell me, and that I never stick out for her.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant wife not allowing her husband to take their daughter on a skiing trip, even though the parents and other family are available to help. The husband feels it's unfair because he's been allowed to spend time with the daughter before and the wife is now being overly protective, especially since she's pregnant and had a miscarriage before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's perspective: she's pregnant, has a history of miscarriage, and is anxious. She might be feeling more vulnerable and overprotective. Her past experience could make her fear that stress or any mishap might lead to another loss. So she's being cautious, even if it seems excessive to the husband.\n\nThen the husband's side: he wants to spend quality time with his daughter, which is a natural thing for a father. He's been allowed time with her before, and now he's being denied even with family support. He might feel his parental rights are being undermined, especially since he hasn't harmed the child before. The wife is pregnant, so maybe she's more emotional, but her concerns are valid given her history.\n\nThe key points here are the wife's health and emotional state due to pregnancy and past trauma. The husband's desire for bonding time is important too, but maybe he's not considering her heightened anxiety. The question is whether the husband is being inconsiderate by pushing for the trip despite her fears. Or if the wife is overreacting and the husband is being reasonable in his request.\n\nAlso, the wife's statement about him always doing what his parents say and not standing up for her suggests there's a communication issue. The husband's actions might not be malicious, but his persistence could be adding stress to the wife, which isn't good for her or the pregnancy. On the other hand, the wife's refusal might be controlling and not trusting her husband's judgment as a parent, which could be damaging their relationship.\n\nI think the balance here is that while the husband's desire for time with his daughter is valid, the wife's health and pregnancy must be prioritized. Her anxiety is legitimate given her medical history. The husband might need to find a middle ground, maybe by adjusting the trip or addressing her concerns rather than insisting on his way. If he's not respecting her feelings and the potential risks, that could be where he's in the wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not sufficiently considering her medical concerns and emotional state, even if his intentions are good.\n"
