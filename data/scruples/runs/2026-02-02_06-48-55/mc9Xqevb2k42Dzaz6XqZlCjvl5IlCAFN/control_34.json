My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not giving the necklace. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author's dad cheated on their mom with this woman. After the split, the dad started living with the woman, but the mom stayed strong. Then the dad got cancer, married her, and gave the author an expensive necklace to give to her after he died. The woman, the stepmom, then acted really badly during the hospice time\u2014preventing the mom from seeing him, causing a fight, and being rude at the funeral. Now, she's harassing the author to get the necklace.\n\nThe author refuses to give it to her because of all the bad behavior. Their friends say to give it and wash their hands off, but the author is sticking to their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's wishes. He asked the author to give the necklace, so there's a promise made. But was that promise valid under the circumstances? The dad was ill and possibly under pressure from the stepmom? Or was the author's dad genuinely trying to make peace or provide for his wife at the end?\n\nThen there's the stepmom's actions. She was abusive towards the author's mom, manipulated the hospice situation, and was disrespectful. So the author's resentment is understandable. The necklace is a symbol of that problematic relationship, and giving it could be seen as endorsing her behavior.\n\nBut legally, if the dad explicitly asked before dying, and the item is his to give, the author might be bound by that. However, if the stepmom didn't receive it and the author is being harassed, maybe there are other ways to handle it, like giving it to family to avoid conflict or legal issues.\n\nBut ethically, the author is torn between honoring their dad's wishes and protecting their family from someone who was harmful. The dad's request might have been based on his desire to make amends or fulfill marital duties, but the stepmom's actions show she's not deserving, in the author's eyes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we look at the dad's wishes, they might feel they're violating a promise. But if the stepmom's actions were malicious, then the author's refusal could be justified as protecting their family's well-being and not enabling abuse.\n\nAlso, the stepmom is now harassing the author, which might affect the situation. Maybe the author could handle it more legally, but the emotional aspect is strong here.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't obligated to give it if they feel it's against their family's interests and the stepmom's actions were harmful. The dad's request might be a factor, but people can change their minds, and maybe the dad's judgment was impaired by illness or the stepmom's influence.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not giving the necklace, especially given the stepmom's behavior. The answer would be B (No).\n"
