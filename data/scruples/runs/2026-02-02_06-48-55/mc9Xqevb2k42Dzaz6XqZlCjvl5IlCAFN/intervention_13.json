My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their dad giving an expensive necklace to his wife before he died, and the author is refusing to give it to her after a series of negative experiences with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The dad cheated, married this woman after his cancer diagnosis, and asked the author to give her the necklace. The stepmom then acted badly during his hospice time, including shoving the mom and cutting them out of the funeral. Now she's pressuring the author for the necklace.\n\nThe author's friends are telling them to give it up, but they don't want to. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. \n\nLegal vs. moral aspects: Legally, if the dad explicitly asked for the necklace to be given and it's part of his estate, the author might be bound by his wishes. However, if the necklace was a gift from the dad to the wife, then it's her property. But if the dad gave it to the author to handle, then perhaps the author has some responsibility.\n\nMoral standpoint: The stepmom's behavior was terrible. She hurt the family, and the author feels justified in not giving the necklace. The dad's request might be seen as a personal wish, but if the wife is using manipulation (like now that she's pressuring for it), the author's refusal could be seen as protecting their dad's memory from being used in a harmful way. \n\nAlso, the dad might have been under pressure from his wife to marry her or give her things, especially considering his guilt. The author might feel that honoring the necklace would be enabling the stepmom's bad actions. Friends saying to give it up might be missing the emotional context. \n\nSo, considering the stepmom's actions and the dad's potential manipulation, the author's refusal could be justified. The necklace is a symbol of the dad's final wishes, but given the circumstances, it's a moral dilemma where the author's choice to protect their family might be right. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
