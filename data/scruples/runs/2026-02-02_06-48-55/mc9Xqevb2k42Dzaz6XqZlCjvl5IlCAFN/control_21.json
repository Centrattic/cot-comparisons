My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmom after their dad passed away. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman. The stepmom tried to cut the family out but the dad kept in touch. After he got cancer, he married her and gave the necklace to her, asking the author to give it after his death. But the stepmom was really hostile, blocked the mom, shoved her, kept the family away from hospice, and made the funeral all about herself. Now she's harassing the author for the necklace.\n\nThe author feels justified in not giving it because of how the stepmom treated them and their mom. Friends say to give it and move on, but the author won't. The key points here are the dad's last wish versus the stepmom's behavior. Normally, honoring a parent's request is important, but if the stepmom was abusive and manipulative, that might tip the scales.\n\nThe stepmom's actions were\u6076\u52a3\u2014physical assault on the mom, keeping the family out of hospice, being disrespectful at the funeral. The author's resistance is a reaction to being wronged. The necklace was given by the dad, but maybe he was coerced or manipulated. The author might not be obligated to follow a request made under such circumstances. Also, the stepmom's persistent harassment adds to the tension. \n\nLegally, if the dad wanted to give the necklace to the stepmom, it's her property, but the author might be holding onto it as per his wish. However, morally, considering the stepmom's actions, the author's decision not to give it could be seen as self-defense against abuse. The author isn't in the wrong because the stepmom's behavior was unacceptable, and the dad's request might not be valid in the context of his manipulation by the stepmom. So the answer is B, No.\n"
