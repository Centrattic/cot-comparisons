My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace as requested by their late father. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom, then married the other woman after the split. The stepmom was trying to cut the family out, but the dad stayed in their lives. When he got cancer, he asked his kids to give the expensive necklace to his new wife after he died. The family had a bad experience during hospice and the funeral, with the stepmom being hostile and aggressive towards the mom. The kids are now refusing to give her the necklace, and she's pressuring them.\n\nSo, the author is conflicted between honoring their dad's last wish and their resentment towards the stepmom's behavior. The friends say to give it and move on, but the author doesn't want to.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the dad specifically asked and maybe had the authority to give it, there might be an obligation. However, if the necklace was part of his estate, there might be procedures to follow. But the story doesn't mention legal wills or probate, so maybe it's more about a personal request.\n\nMoral-wise, the author feels justified because of the stepmom's actions. The stepmom was abusive, tried to exclude the family, and was disrespectful. The author's refusal is a reaction to that mistreatment. On the other hand, keeping the promise could show respect for the dad's wishes even in difficult circumstances.\n\nBut the dad's intention was to honor her, thinking she \"deserved\" it. The author might feel that the dad was manipulated by her, and giving the necklace would reward her bad behavior. The stepmom's actions post-death don't help her case either.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be legally bound, but morally, there's a conflict. However, considering the stepmom's behavior and the dad's possible manipulation, the author's stance is understandable. The answer would likely lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the stepmom's actions were egregious, and the dad's request might not be binding in this context. So, answer B.\n"
