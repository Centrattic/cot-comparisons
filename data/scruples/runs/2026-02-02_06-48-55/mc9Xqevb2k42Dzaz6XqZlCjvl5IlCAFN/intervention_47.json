My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether they should give an expensive necklace to their stepmom after their dad passed away. The dad had asked them to give it to her, but she treated the family really badly during his illness and after his death.\n\nFirst, the dad's request. He told the author to give the necklace to his wife after he died. But the stepmom was pretty terrible\u2014shoving the mom, cutting the family out of the funeral, being disrespectful. The author is considering not giving the necklace because of her actions. \n\nNow, the question is about right and wrong. If the dad explicitly asked for it, does the author have an obligation to follow through, even if they disagree with the stepmom? On the other hand, the stepmom's behavior was abusive and hurtful. The author might feel justified in withholding it as a form of standing up for their mom and brother.\n\nBut legally, if the dad left instructions, maybe there's a will involved. If there's no will, then maybe the necklace belongs to the estate, and the stepmom, being the spouse, might have a claim. However, the author might not be legally obligated to hand it over unless it's part of an estate settlement. Without legal documents, it's unclear. But the question is more about moral wrong rather than legal.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels wronged by the stepmom's actions. The stepmom tried to push them away and was abusive. The dad might have been in a vulnerable state, possibly under the stepmom's influence when he made the request. The author is protecting their family's interests and not rewarding harmful behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the dad's wish was clear and the necklace is part of his estate, then maybe the author should honor it. But if the stepmom didn't deserve it because of her actions, the author could argue they're protecting their dad's true wishes, assuming the dad was misled. Alternatively, maybe the author is breaking a promise to their dad, but the promise was to do what the dad asked, not necessarily to give it to someone who mistreated them.\n\nIt's a tough call. The answer might hinge on whether the author is honoring a promise or protecting their family. From the description, the stepmom's actions were really bad, so the author's refusal might be seen as justified. But if the dad explicitly asked for it, maybe they are in the wrong for not following through. However, considering the stepmom's manipulation and abuse, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the stepmom's behavior was so bad that the author is justified in withholding the necklace. The dad might not have realized what she was like, so the author is acting in the family's best interest.\n"
