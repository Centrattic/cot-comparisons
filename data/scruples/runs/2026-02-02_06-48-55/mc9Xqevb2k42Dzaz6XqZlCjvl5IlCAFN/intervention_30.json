My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to his stepmom after his dad passed away. The situation is pretty complicated. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman. They split up, but the dad continued to see her and even married her after his cancer diagnosis. He gave the necklace to the daughter, telling her to give it to his new wife after he died. But the stepmom treated the family really badly\u2014cutting them out, being rude, even shoving the mom. The daughter is holding onto the necklace and refuses to give it, even though some friends think she should just give it to her and be done with it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. So, what's the key point here? The dad's last wish versus the stepmom's behavior. The author is conflicted between honoring her dad's request and protecting herself from a toxic person. Legally, if the dad gave the necklace to his daughter to pass on, there might be some obligation. But emotionally, the stepmom's actions were harmful. \n\nBut then, did the dad have the right to make that request? He was dying, and maybe he was trying to reconcile with his new wife. The daughter followed through initially but now refuses because of the stepmom's actions. The stepmom is now pressuring her for the necklace. \n\nIs the daughter in the wrong? Well, if the dad explicitly asked her to give it, and she agreed, then she might be in a moral dilemma. But given the stepmom's behavior, maybe the dad's judgment was impaired. The daughter might feel justified in protecting her family and not supporting someone who was abusive. \n\nI think it's a tough call. On one hand, honoring a parent's last wish is important. On the other, the stepmom's actions were harmful. The daughter's refusal could be seen as standing up for her family. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But legally or morally? The stepmom might claim she's entitled to it, but the daughter's reasons are valid. So I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
