My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves their dad giving an expensive necklace to his wife, who the author is now reluctant to give after his death. The wife cheated on the mom, then tried to cut the family out, and there was some conflict at the funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's wishes. He asked the author to give the necklace to the wife, so there's a legal and moral obligation here. But then there's the context of the wife's behavior. She shoved the mom, kept the family away from hospice, and made the funeral all about herself. The author feels justified in not giving her the necklace because of her actions.\n\nOn one hand, the dad's final request might be important for respecting his wishes. On the other hand, the wife's behavior was terrible, and the author has valid reasons to resent her. The friends are telling the author to give it and let it go, but the author refuses. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could give the necklace but set boundaries. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the author doesn't give the necklace, are they violating their dad's wishes? But the dad was under the wife's influence at the end, maybe. The wife might not deserve it after her actions. \n\nThe author's perspective is that the dad was being used, so the necklace was a result of manipulation. The dad's request might have been based on being manipulated rather than a genuine desire. So the author's refusal isn't just about the necklace but about protecting their mom and family. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit complicated. Legally, the dad owned the necklace, so if he gave it to the wife, the author has no claim. But morally, the wife's actions could make the author feel justified in not giving it. However, the author agreed to do it for their dad's sake. Now, they're breaking that promise. \n\nBut since the dad is dead, maybe the author isn't bound by that promise if they feel the wife doesn't deserve it. The key is whether the dad's request was valid. If the wife was manipulative, maybe the dad wasn't in a clear state of mind. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for honoring their own feelings and protecting their family. \n\nSo the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author has valid reasons to not give the necklace, considering the wife's actions and the dad's possible manipulation.\n"
