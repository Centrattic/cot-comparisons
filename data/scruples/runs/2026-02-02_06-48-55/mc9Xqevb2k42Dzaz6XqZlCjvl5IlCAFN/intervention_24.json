My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his stepmom. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom and married this woman after finding out he had cancer. He asked the author to give her the necklace after he died. But the stepmom did a bunch of terrible things: shoved the mom, cut them out of the funeral, etc. The author is holding onto the necklace and refusing to give it, which the stepmom is now pressuring him for. The author's friends think he should give it and move on, but he doesn't feel bad.\n\nSo, the question is about moral responsibility. The dad's request was a last wish, but the stepmom's actions were harmful. The author is conflicted between honoring his dad's wish and protecting his family from someone he sees as manipulative.\n\nLegally, if the necklace was part of the dad's will or inheritance, the author might need to follow legal procedures. But in terms of ethics, it's about whether honoring a request when the recipient has been abusive. The stepmom's behavior complicates things. The author's stance is that the stepmom was using the dad and doesn't deserve the necklace. Friends are advising to give it, but the author is against it.\n\nI think the key points are the dad's intentions versus the stepmom's actions. If the author went along with the dad's request despite knowing the stepmom treated them poorly, he might be in the wrong. But if the stepmom's actions were so harmful that fulfilling the request would be harmful to the family, then he's justified. The stepmom's behavior seems malicious, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the dad explicitly asked him to give it, so there's a conflict between honoring a parent's wish and protecting the family. \n\nI think it's a judgment call, but given the stepmom's actions, the author is not in the wrong for not giving it to her. So answer B.\n"
