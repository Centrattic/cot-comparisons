My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated, so I need to break it down. \n\nFirst, the user's dad cheated on their mom and then married his mistress. After he got cancer, he asked his children to give this expensive necklace to his wife (the mistress) after he died. The author agrees for his dad's sake. But then, the stepmom is really mean to the family, even shoving the mom and keeping them away from the dad's final moments. She also behaves badly at the funeral. Now, the stepmom is pressuring the author to give her the necklace, but the author doesn't want to.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not giving the necklace. The author's dad made a request, but the stepmom acted badly, making the author not want to honor that request.\n\nLegally, if the dad gave the necklace to the kids with the intention to give it to the wife, maybe there's an obligation. But since the wife is being unreasonable and had a bad relationship with the family, maybe there's moral leeway. Also, if the necklace was a gift to the wife, the kids might not have the right to withhold it. But if the dad intended to have the kids give it after death, maybe there's a legal aspect if it was part of his will. However, since he gave it to the kids directly, maybe it's their possession and they can choose not to give it.\n\nMoral-wise, the author is hurt by the stepmom's actions. The stepmom's behavior at the hospice and funeral is pretty terrible. The author might feel that honoring the stepmom now would be supporting her actions. However, the dad's last wish is a factor. If the dad explicitly asked to give it, the author might feel conflicted. But given the stepmom's behavior, the author's decision not to give it might be seen as justified to avoid enabling her.\n\nThe friends are advising to give it and move on, but the author is choosing not to. The key points here are the dad's intent versus the stepmom's actions. The author might not be in the wrong because they are protecting their family's well-being and not enabling someone who was abusive. Also, the stepmom's actions might have voided any obligation to honor her. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
