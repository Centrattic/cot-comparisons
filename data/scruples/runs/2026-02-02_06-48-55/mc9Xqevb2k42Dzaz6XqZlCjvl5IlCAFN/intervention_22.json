My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmother after their dad's death. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman, and after the split, he started living with her. The stepmom tried to cut the family out, but the dad stayed in touch. Then he got cancer, married her, and gave the necklace to her as a final request. The stepmom then acted really badly during the hospice and funeral, even shoving the mom and cutting the family out. Now she's hassling the author for the necklace.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they promised the dad to give it, but the stepmom's behavior is awful. The friends are telling them to give it and move on, but they're holding out. The question is whether not giving the necklace makes them the \"asshole.\"\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if the dad explicitly asked for the necklace to be given, it's a valid request. But the stepmom's actions were abusive and destructive. Emotionally, the author is hurt and doesn't want to enable her. Legally, the necklace might be considered part of the estate, so if the dad left it to her, the author might have a duty. But if the dad gave it directly to her before death, maybe it's hers by right. However, if it's part of the estate, the author might need to follow the will or intestacy laws.\n\nMoral-wise, honoring the dad's last wish is important, but the stepmom's actions were toxic. The author's refusal could be seen as justified because the stepmom didn't deserve it given her behavior. Also, the stepmom's actions during hospice and the funeral were inconsiderate, which adds to the justification.\n\nThe family's perspective is that they were the legitimate family, and the stepmom exploited the dad. The author's decision not to give the necklace could be seen as standing up against abuse. However, fulfilling the request might be seen as respecting the dad's wishes despite the stepmom's actions.\n\nThere's a balance between honoring the deceased's wishes and protecting oneself from someone who caused harm. The author's friends might think giving it is better for peace, but the author's experience with the stepmom's behavior makes them reluctant. It's a tough spot.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the answer depends on whether fulfilling the dad's request is more important than the stepmom's actions. If the dad's last wish is binding, the author is in the wrong for not complying. But if the stepmom's actions nullify that request, then the author isn't. Since the dad's request was made in his final moments, perhaps with the influence of illness, maybe his judgment was clouded, making the request less valid. However, the author might feel they can't be responsible for someone who showed such disregard.\n\nSo, leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the stepmom's actions were egregious, and honoring the dad's wish in this context could enable her further harm. The author's decision to protect themselves and family is justifiable.\n"
