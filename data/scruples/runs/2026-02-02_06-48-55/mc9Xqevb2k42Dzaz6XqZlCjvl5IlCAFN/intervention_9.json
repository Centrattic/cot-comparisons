My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmother after their dad's death.\n\nFirst, the background: The dad cheated on the mom with the stepmother, who later moved in with him. After the dad's cancer diagnosis, he married her and asked the author to give her the necklace upon his death. The stepmother then acted cruelly during hospice, blocked the mom, shoved her, and excluded them from the funeral. The author refuses to give the necklace now, leading to harassment from the stepmother.\n\nSo, the key points here are the dad's request versus the stepmother's actions. The author is conflicted between honoring their dad's last wish and the stepmother's behavior. The stepmother's actions were abusive and manipulative, which complicates the situation.\n\nThe author's friends suggest giving the necklace to end the conflict, but the author feels justified in not giving it due to the stepmother's actions. The question is whether the author is wrong for not honoring their dad's request despite the stepmother's behavior.\n\nLegally, if the necklace was a gift from the dad to the stepmother, the author might have a duty to pass it on. However, morally, the stepmother's actions might negate that obligation. The dad's request was made under the influence of his illness and possibly manipulated by the stepmother. Also, the stepmother's behavior shows she doesn't deserve the item, which adds to the author's justification.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is justified by the stepmother's actions and the context of the dad's possible manipulation. Since the stepmother was using the dad and causing harm, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their family's well-being and honoring their dad's true wishes, which might have been clouded by her manipulation.\n"
