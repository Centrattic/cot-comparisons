My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to their stepmom. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman. After the split, he started living with her. She tried to cut the family out, but the dad stayed in touch. Then he got cancer, married her, and gave the necklace to the author to give her after his death. The stepmom, though, was hostile during his hospice stay, physically attacked the author's mom, and made the funeral about herself. The author refuses to give her the necklace now.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that the stepmom didn't deserve the necklace after her actions. The dad's wish was to give it, but the stepmom's behavior was terrible. The friends think the author should just give it and move on. But the author is holding out, not feeling bad for not giving it.\n\nLegally, if the necklace was given to the author by the dad, maybe the author is the rightful owner. But the dad asked him to give it. However, the stepmom's actions were abusive and harmful. The author's refusal could be seen as protecting the family from someone who hurt them. On the other hand, the dad's last wish might weigh on the other side.\n\nEthically, it's a bit of a toss-up. The dad's intent was to give it, but the stepmom's actions might make the author feel justified in not giving it. The author might be prioritizing their family's well-being over their dad's request, considering the stepmom's behavior. The stepmom's actions were clearly bad, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not fulfilling the request if it's against their family's interests.\n\nAlso, the stepmom is harassing the author, making the situation worse. If the author gives the necklace, it might enable her further. There's a lot of emotional damage here. The author's stance is that they don't owe her anything because she caused so much harm. Given that, the author might be right. The dad's request could be seen as a personal wish, but the stepmom's actions nullify any obligation the author has to fulfill it. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
