My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. \n\nThe author's dad cheated on his wife, then left with another woman. The stepmom (the woman he cheated with) tried to cut the family out, but the dad kept in touch. Then he got cancer, married her, and gave the author an expensive necklace to give her after his death. The author agreed. But when the dad was in hospice, the stepmom didn't let the author's mom or family see him, caused a fight, and was rude at the funeral. Now the stepmom is demanding the necklace, and the author is refusing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace.\n\nFirst, the dad gave the necklace to the author with the condition to give it to the stepmom after his death. So legally, if the dad owned the necklace, he could give it to the stepmom via his will, or by telling his child to do so. But the author is refusing. There's a conflict here between fulfilling the deceased's last request and the stepmom's actions. \n\nThe author's friends are telling them to give the necklace and let it go, but they feel it's justified not to because of the stepmom's behavior. The stepmom was abusive, excluded the family, and was disrespectful at the funeral. The author feels she doesn't deserve it. \n\nMoral considerations: Did the dad have the right to ask for the necklace to be given to someone who mistreated the family? If the stepmom was using him, does that affect the validity of his request? Also, the stepmom is aggressively trying to get the necklace, which adds to the tension. \n\nLegally, if the dad intended to give the necklace to the stepmom, the author might be bound by his request. However, if the author didn't receive the necklace from the estate (maybe it's part of the dad's assets that should go through a will), then the stepmom might have a claim. But the story says the dad gave it to the author to give to her, so maybe it's a personal bequest. \n\nEthically, the author is in a tough spot. On one hand, honoring the dad's last wish. On the other, the stepmom's actions were harmful. The author's decision not to give it could be seen as a way to protect their family and not reward the stepmom's behavior. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the dad's request is considered valid despite the stepmom's actions. If the dad was of sound mind when he gave the necklace, the author might be in the wrong for not fulfilling his request. But if the stepmom was manipulating him, maybe the author is justified. \n\nIn the story, the author mentions that the stepmom was using him and not caring about who she hurt, implying that her intentions were bad. The dad might have been in a vulnerable state due to his illness, possibly influenced by her. \n\nSo, the author isn't giving the necklace to someone who treated their family badly, which could be seen as a moral choice. But legally, if the dad had the right to bestow it, the author might be in the wrong. However, the story doesn't mention a will or legal documents, just a verbal request. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and the emotional impact. The stepmom's actions were clearly harmful, so the author's decision to withhold the gift might be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
