My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmother after their dad's death.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The dad cheated on the user's mom, then married the stepmom. The stepmom tried to cut the family out, but the dad stayed involved. When the dad got cancer, he gave the necklace to the stepmom, asking the author to give it after he died. However, during the hospice, the stepmom lied about the hospice transfer, blocked the mom from seeing him, and had a hostile funeral. Now the stepmom is demanding the necklace.\n\nThe user's friends say to give it and move on, but the author is refusing. They feel justified because of the stepmom's actions. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, the dad wanted the necklace given, but the stepmom's behavior was abusive. The author could argue that fulfilling the dad's wish is important, but the stepmom's actions might make them less deserving. However, legally, the dad gave the item to her, so the author might be obligated to deliver it. \n\nBut emotionally, the author is hurt by the stepmom's actions. There's a conflict between honoring the dad's last wish and protecting themselves from someone who was harmful. The stepmom's behavior, like lying about hospice and shoving the mom, is serious. The author might feel that giving the necklace would validate the stepmom's actions or enable further harassment.\n\nSome might say the author should follow the dad's wishes, while others might empathize with not giving it due to the stepmom's behavior. The key is whether the author is morally wrong. If the dad explicitly asked, there's an obligation, but if the stepmom isn't deserving, maybe not. However, the author's refusal could be seen as going against the dad's wishes. But given the stepmom's actions, others might support the author's decision for self-respect and family protection.\n\nLegally, the necklace was a gift from the dad to the stepmom, so the author might be obligated to give it. But the user is asking about being in the \"wrong\" in terms of morality, not law. The answer hinges on whether fulfilling the dad's request is more important than the stepmom's actions. Since the stepmom acted poorly, many might side with the author.\n"
