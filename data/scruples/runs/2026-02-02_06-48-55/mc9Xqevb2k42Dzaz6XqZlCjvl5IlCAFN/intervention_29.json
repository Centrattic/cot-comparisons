My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to their stepmom after their dad's death. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated on the mom with another woman. The stepmom tried to push the family out but the dad didn't let her. When he got sick, he married her and gave the author a necklace to give to her after he died. The stepmom then acted in a hostile way during the hospice time, shoved the author's mom, and controlled the funeral. Now the stepmom is harassing the author for the necklace.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they promised their dad to give it, but they feel the stepmom doesn't deserve it. The friends are telling them to give it and move on, but they don't want to. \n\nI remember that in legal terms, if someone makes a request as they're dying, especially about distributing property, there might be a moral or legal obligation. But in this case, the necklace was a gift from the dad to the stepmom, not necessarily part of the estate if the dad owned it. If the dad legally gave it to the stepmom before he died, the author might not have a legal claim. But since the dad asked the author to give it after his death, it's more about honoring that request.\n\nHowever, the stepmom's actions were really harmful. The author might feel justified in not giving it because of her behavior. But legally, if the dad intended to give it to her, the author might be in the wrong for not following through. Morally, it's complicated because the stepmom didn't deserve it given her actions. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, you can't be forced to give a gift unless there's a legal agreement. However, if the dad had a will specifying the necklace goes to her, the author might have a legal duty. But here, the dad verbally asked the author to give it. If there's no will, the author isn't legally obligated. However, there's a moral obligation. The stepmom might argue the dad gave it to her, but the author is withholding it. \n\nBut considering the stepmom's behavior, the author might feel justified in withholding it. However, the author agreed to the request for the dad's sake. Breaking that promise could be seen as wrong. But given the stepmom's actions, the author might feel they're doing the right thing. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it's a toss-up. Legally, maybe not, but morally, it's a gray area. The author's friends say to give it and move on, but the author is choosing not to. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they were legally bound, then yes. But since it's a verbal request, maybe not. However, morally, if the dad's request was to honor the stepmom, the author might be in the wrong for not following through, despite her actions. But the stepmom's actions could negate that. \n\nIn the end, it's about whether honoring the dad's request or protecting the family from someone who caused harm takes precedence. The author is choosing the latter. So, depending on perspective, they might be in the wrong or not. The user thinks they are in the wrong, but others might say they're not. Maybe the answer is B (No), because the author isn't legally obligated and the stepmom's actions make it reasonable to withhold. But some might say the author broke their promise to the dad, so they are in the wrong (A). Hmm. Need to decide.\n"
