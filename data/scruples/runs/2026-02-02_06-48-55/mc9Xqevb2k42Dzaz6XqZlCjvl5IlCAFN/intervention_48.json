My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to his stepmom. The story is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: The author's dad cheated on his mom with this other woman. They split up, the dad started living with the woman, and she tried to cut the family out. But the dad still stayed in touch. Then he got cancer, married the woman, and gave the author a necklace to give her after he died. The author agreed for his dad's sake.\n\nNow, during the hospice part, the stepmom didn't let the author's mom see the dad, shoved her, and kicked them out quickly. The funeral was also messed up, with the stepmom putting them down and focusing on her own achievements. The stepmom is now hounding the author for the necklace, and he's refusing to give it because of her behavior.\n\nThe author feels she doesn't deserve it, especially after her actions. His friends want him to give it and move on, but he's against it. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, where's the conflict here? Legally, if the dad gave the necklace to the author with the request to give it to her, the author might be bound by that. But emotionally, the stepmom's behavior complicates things. The author is torn between honoring his dad's last wish and protecting his family and his feelings about her.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is in a tough spot. The dad's wish is one thing, but the stepmom's actions might justify not following through. Some might argue the author should honor the dad's request regardless, but others might say the stepmom's actions make it okay to withhold the necklace. The author's friends think he should just give it and forget, but he's not willing to.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. The key points are the dad's final wishes versus the stepmom's behavior. If the dad explicitly said to give it, but the stepmom acted inappropriately, the author might be justified in not giving it for the family's protection. However, legally, if there's a document or clear instruction, maybe the author is in the wrong. But without legal binding, it's more about moral obligation. Given the stepmom's actions, the author's refusal seems understandable. So, probably B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
