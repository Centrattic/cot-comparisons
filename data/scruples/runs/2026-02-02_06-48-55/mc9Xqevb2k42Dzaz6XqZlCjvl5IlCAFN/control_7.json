My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his stepmom. Let's break down the situation. The dad cheated on his wife (the author's mom) with a woman who then moved in with him. The stepmom tried to cut the family out, but the dad stayed in their lives. After the dad got cancer, he married this woman, gave the author an expensive necklace to give to her after he died, and asked to be nice to her. But when the time came, the stepmom was hostile, shoved the mom, kept the family away from the hospice, and acted cruelly at the funeral. Now she's demanding the necklace, and the author refuses.\n\nFirst, the dad's wishes. He asked the author to give the necklace, so there's a promise or a request involved. But the stepmom's behavior was terrible. The author feels she doesn't deserve it because of her actions. The question is whether honoring the dad's last wish is more important than the stepmom's behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the author is following through on a promise to his dad, which is a personal commitment. On the other hand, the stepmom's actions were harmful, so giving her the necklace might feel like enabling her. But the dad might have had reasons to want her to have it, maybe to make peace or because he loved her despite the issues. However, the stepmom's actions after his death don't reflect well on her character. The author's friends suggest giving it to her to avoid conflict, but the author is standing his ground.\n\nLegal perspective: If the necklace was given by the dad as a gift, then it's a matter of fulfilling that request. But if the dad had the legal right to give it, then the author is following his wishes. However, if there's no legal obligation, it's more about moral obligation. The stepmom's actions might negate the dad's good intentions if she was using him.\n\nMoral perspective: The author is protecting his family and honoring his dad's memory by not supporting someone who caused pain. The dad might have been under pressure from her or in a vulnerable state when he made the request. The stepmom's behavior post-death shows she's not worthy of the necklace.\n\nSo, the author's decision is a mix of honoring his dad's wish versus protecting his family. But considering the stepmom's actions, the author isn't in the wrong. The dad's request was under circumstances that might not have reflected his true wishes. The author is justified in not giving it to her.\n"
