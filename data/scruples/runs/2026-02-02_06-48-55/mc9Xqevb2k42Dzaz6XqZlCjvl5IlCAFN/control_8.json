My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to his stepmother as his late father requested.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated, married the stepmom after divorcing the author's mom. The stepmom tried to cut the family out. The dad, knowing he was dying of cancer, asked the author to give the necklace to his stepmom, saying she \"deserved\" it. But after the dad's death, the stepmom acted cruelly, prevented the mom from seeing him, shoved her, and then at the funeral, excluded the family and talked badly about them. Now the stepmom is demanding the necklace, and the author is refusing.\n\nSo the key points are: the author's dad made a request, but the stepmom's behavior was toxic. The author is holding onto the necklace, not giving it to her. The friends are telling him to give it and move on, but he won't.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the dad owned the necklace and asked to have it given to his wife, then the author might be bound by that. But ethically, it's more complex. The stepmom's actions were abusive and harmful. The author might feel that giving the necklace would validate her actions or enable her further. \n\nIn many cases, people prioritize their own well-being and that of their family over fulfilling a request that's ethically conflicting. The stepmom's behavior suggests she's manipulative, and the author's decision not to give the necklace could be seen as protecting himself and his family from her. However, the dad's final wish adds emotional weight. But if the stepmom was using the dad and didn't truly deserve the necklace, the author might feel justified in not complying.\n\nLaws about fulfilling someone's final wishes can vary. If the dad didn't legally transfer ownership or include it in his will, the author might legally own the necklace and can choose not to give it. Ethically, it's about what's fair. The stepmom's actions were harmful, so the author's refusal could be seen as self-preservation.\n\nIn similar situations, people often consider the intent behind the request. If the dad was manipulated into giving the necklace, the author might not be obligated. The author's main argument is that the stepmom didn't deserve it and was using the dad. Given that context, the author's decision is a personal choice to protect himself from someone who caused harm.\n\nSo, considering the stepmom's behavior and the potential for manipulation, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his family's well-being and not fulfilling a request that now seems unjustified.\n"
