My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. I need to evaluate based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's father cheated on his wife (the author's mom) with another woman. The dad and this woman got married after being diagnosed with cancer. Before dying, the dad asked the author to give the woman a valuable necklace. The woman then acted hostile, tried to keep the family away during his hospice period, physically shoved the mom, and was rude at the funeral. Now, the woman is pressuring the author to hand over the necklace.\n\nThe author is refusing to give the necklace because of the woman's actions, even though it was their dad's last request. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not doing so.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the dad gave the necklace to the author before dying, and asked to give it to the woman, the author might have a legal obligation. But if the dad had already given the necklace to the woman as part of his estate, the author might not have a claim. However, the story says the dad gave it to the author to give to the woman after his death. So legally, the author might be bound by the dad's instructions unless there's a will or legal document contradicting that.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The author is upset about the woman's behavior. The woman's actions were hostile, which could make the author feel justified in not following through. The dad's dying wish might weigh against the author's feelings. But the author's mom was physically assaulted, and the woman was abusive during the hospice time. This could be seen as the woman not deserving the necklace, especially after her actions.\n\nThe author's friends suggest giving it to her and cutting ties. But the author is choosing not to, which shows they're prioritizing their mom's well-being and the woman's actions over their dad's last request.\n\nIn many cases, respecting a parent's last wishes is important, but when the recipient has caused harm, there's room for moral judgment. The woman's behavior was egregious. The author's refusal might be seen as protecting their family from further harm rather than disregarding their father's wishes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the dad explicitly asked for it, but the woman's actions were abusive, the author's refusal could be justified. The key here is the context of the woman's behavior and the dad's possible state of mind when making the request. If the dad was in a vulnerable state during his illness, maybe he wasn't fully aware of the woman's true nature. The author might be acting in their family's best interest.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the woman's actions justify the refusal, even if the dad asked. The author is protecting their family and not rewarding harmful behavior.\n"
