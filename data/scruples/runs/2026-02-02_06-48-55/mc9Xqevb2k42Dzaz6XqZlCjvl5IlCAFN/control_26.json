My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe author's dad cheated on their mom with another woman. After the divorce, the dad started living with the other woman, who tried to cut the family out. The dad didn't let her, stayed in their lives. Then he got cancer, married this woman, and gave the author an expensive necklace to give her after he died. The author agreed for his sake. \n\nBut then, when the dad was in hospice, the woman didn't let the author, their brother, or their mom be with him properly. She even shoved the mom during an argument. At the funeral, she excluded the family and focused on herself. Now the woman is harassing the author for the necklace, and the author refuses to give it to her because of her actions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace despite the dad's request.\n\nHmm. The dad's last wish was to give her the necklace, but the woman's behavior was really bad. The author has a valid reason to be upset. The woman didn't treat them well and even physically attacked the mom. The author's friends suggest giving it to her to avoid problems, but the author feels justified in not doing so because of her actions. \n\nThe dad might have been manipulated or not fully aware of her true nature, especially as his health declined. The author is prioritizing their family's well-being and not enabling someone who was abusive. Legally, if the necklace was a gift from the dad, the woman might have a claim, but morally, the author has a strong case. The woman's actions were harmful, and the author is protecting themselves and their family from further harm. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons to refuse based on the woman's behavior and the dad's manipulation possibly due to her actions during his illness.\n"
