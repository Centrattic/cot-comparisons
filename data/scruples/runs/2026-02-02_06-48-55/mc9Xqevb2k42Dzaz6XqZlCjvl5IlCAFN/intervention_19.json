My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the author should give a necklace to their stepmother, who was the woman their dad cheated with. The dad asked the author to give her the necklace after he passed, but the stepmom was pretty awful during the hospice and funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's last request. He asked the author to give the necklace, which could be seen as respecting his wishes. But then, the stepmom's behavior was really bad\u2014shoving the mom, keeping them away from the hospice, and being rude at the funeral. The author is angry and feels she doesn't deserve the necklace now. \n\nThe author's friends are telling them to just give it and forget, but the author is holding out. The stepmom is now being pushy and aggressive about getting the necklace. The author doesn't feel they owe her anything, given her actions. \n\nSo, the main conflict is between honoring the dad's last request versus the stepmom's behavior. Legally, if the necklace was given by the dad to her, the author might have a duty to pass it on if that's what he asked. But morally, the stepmom's actions could make the author feel justified in not giving it. \n\nBut was the necklace a gift from the dad to the stepmom? If the dad intended for her to have it, then the author's refusal could be seen as going against his wishes. However, if the dad's decision was influenced by his guilt or the stepmom's manipulation, maybe the author is right to question it.\n\nAlso, the stepmom's actions were harmful. She caused a lot of pain, so the author's resentment is understandable. The author might feel that giving the necklace would be rewarding her bad behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, not honoring the dad's request might cause guilt for the author. It's a tough balance. Legally, if the necklace is the dad's property, the author might be obligated to pass it on. But if the dad didn't officially transfer ownership, the author could have a say. \n\nI think the key here is the intention behind the necklace. The dad asked to give it to her, but the stepmom's actions make the author question that. The author is conflicted between loyalty to their father's wishes and their own feelings about the stepmom. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the necklace was a gift from the dad to his wife, then not giving it might be seen as not respecting his request. However, the stepmom's actions could make the author's refusal understandable. So, depending on the situation, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is standing up for what they believe is right given the stepmom's behavior, even if it means not following their dad's wish. Alternatively, if the dad's request was valid, then A (in the wrong) might be the case. But given the context of the stepmom's harmful actions, B seems more likely.\n"
