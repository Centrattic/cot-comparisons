My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his stepmom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman, and then married her after the divorce. The stepmom tried to cut the family out but the dad kept in contact. When the dad got cancer, he gave the son an expensive necklace to give to the stepmom after his death, saying she \"deserved\" it. But then during hospice, the stepmom prevented the family from being with the dad, even shoving the mom. The funeral was a mess, and now she's obsessively asking for the necklace.\n\nThe author refuses to give it, and friends suggest giving it to end the harassment. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the dad's request was to give the necklace as per his wish. However, the stepmom's actions were harmful and manipulative. The author is caught between honoring his father's last wish and protecting himself and his family from a toxic person.\n\nLegally, if the dad explicitly asked, there might be an obligation, but morally, the stepmom's behavior complicates things. The author's refusal is a reaction to the abuse and betrayal by the stepmom. Friends advising to give it up might not see the context fully.\n\nThe key points are the stepmom's actions post-diagnosis and the dad's possible manipulation or poor judgment. The author is protecting his family and not rewarding harmful behavior. It's a conflict between honoring a wish and self-respect.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author isn't obligated to fulfill a request that serves someone who wronged his family. The dad's wishes might not have accounted for the stepmom's true nature, and the author is justified in protecting himself from harassment and exploitation.\n"
