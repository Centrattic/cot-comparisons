My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his stepmom as requested by his dad. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The dad cheated on the mom with another woman. After they split up, the dad started living with the woman, but the author's family kept in touch. Then the dad got cancer, married her, and gave the author an expensive necklace to give her after he died. The stepmom was really mean to them during hospice, shoved the mom, kept them away from the funeral, and the author is now refusing to give her the necklace because of her behavior.\n\nThe author's friends say he should give it to her and wash his hands off. The question is, is he in the wrong for not giving it?\n\nI think the key points here are the dad's last wish versus the stepmom's actions. The author had agreed to give the necklace for his dad's sake, but given how the stepmom treated them, he's refusing. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the stepmom's behavior seems really bad\u2014attacking the mom, cutting them out of the funeral, being rude. The author is justified in feeling hurt and not wanting to give her anything. But legally, if the dad asked him to give it to her, there might be some obligation, though the author could argue the circumstances. \n\nHowever, the necklace was a gift from the dad to the stepmom, so maybe the author's obligation is to honor the dad's request. But the stepmom's actions during hospice make it a tough call. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often considers intentions and context. The author didn't want to take that necklace for himself, but he's standing up for his mom and not rewarding bad behavior. The stepmom was using the dad and causing harm, so the author's refusal could be seen as justified. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because honoring his dad's wish might be a good intention, but the stepmom's actions make it reasonable to not fulfill the request, especially since it's clear she didn't deserve it given her behavior.\n"
