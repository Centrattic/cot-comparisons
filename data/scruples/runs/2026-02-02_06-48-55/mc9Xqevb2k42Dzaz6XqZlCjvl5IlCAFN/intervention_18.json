My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to their stepmother. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's dad cheated on their mom, married the stepmother, who then tried to cut the family out. After the dad got sick, he gave the author a necklace to give to the stepmother after he died, saying she \"deserved\" it. The stepmother later acted badly during hospice, clashed with the mom, and was rude at the funeral. Now, she's pressuring the author for the necklace.\n\nThe author feels they don't owe her anything and refuses to give it. Their friends suggest giving it and moving on, but the author is against it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the dad made a final request. The author had agreed to honor it for the dad's sake. But the stepmother's behavior was terrible, manipulating and being abusive. The necklace is expensive, and keeping it might be seen as going against the dad's wish, but giving it could enable the stepmother's greed and disrespect.\n\nLegally, if the dad left instructions in a will, the author might be obligated. But if it's a verbal request without legal backing, it's more about personal ethics. The stepmother's actions were harmful, so the author might feel justified in not fulfilling the request. However, the dad's final wishes are a significant factor. \n\nEmotionally, the author is conflicted. They want to honor their dad but are hurt by the stepmother. Friends are split, but the author is resolute. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The final decision hinges on balancing respect for the dad's wishes against the stepmother's actions. Since the dad's request might have been influenced by his illness or manipulation, the author's choice to protect their family's well-being could be morally justified. The key is that the stepmother's behavior was abusive, making the author's refusal a form of self-preservation and protecting their family.\n"
