My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether they should give a necklace to their stepmom after their dad passed away. \n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman, who later became his wife. The author and their brother had a bad experience at the hospice and funeral, where the stepmom was hostile, pushed the mom, and excluded them from the funeral. Now, the stepmom is demanding the necklace, which the dad asked the author to give her before he died.\n\nThe author is torn because their dad asked them to give it, but they're upset about how the stepmom treated them and their family. Their friends are telling them to give it and move on, but they don't want to. They feel justified in keeping the necklace because of the stepmom's behavior. \n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) the dad's final wish, 2) the stepmom's actions, and 3) the author's feelings of betrayal and injustice. \n\nThe author's main argument is that the stepmom didn't deserve the necklace after her actions. The dad might have been under her influence or not seeing her true nature, leading him to make that request. The stepmom's behavior post-dad's death suggests she's more interested in the necklace and her own gain than honoring his memory. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is respecting their dad's last request but is also protecting themselves and their family from someone who caused harm. However, by not giving the necklace, they might be going against their dad's wishes. But given the context, the stepmom's actions make it hard to see her as a deserving recipient. The author's refusal could be seen as standing up for themselves and their family, especially since the stepmom was aggressive and manipulative.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their dad's wishes are important, but the stepmom's actions post-hospice and funeral make the situation more complicated. The author is protecting their family and not rewarding the stepmom's behavior. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
