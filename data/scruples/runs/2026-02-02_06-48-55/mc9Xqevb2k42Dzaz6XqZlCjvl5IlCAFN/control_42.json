My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his stepmom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe dad cheated on his wife (the user's mom) with the stepmom. After the split, the dad started living with her. When he got cancer, he married her and asked the user to give her an expensive necklace after he died. The stepmom, however, was hostile towards the user's mom and family, even shoving her and cutting them off during hospice. The funeral was a mess, and the stepmom kept pushing the user for the necklace.\n\nThe user is holding onto the necklace, not giving it to her, and friends are telling him to just give it and move on. His reasoning is that she didn't deserve it after her actions, even though it was his dad's last request. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's intentions. He asked for the necklace to be given to her, possibly because he still wanted to provide for her or fulfill his marriage commitment. But given that the stepmom was abusive and manipulative, the user might feel that honoring a request made under duress or in the face of her manipulation is unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad might have genuinely believed she deserved it, regardless of her actions. The user is in a conflict between honoring his father's wish and protecting his family from someone who caused harm. \n\nThe stepmom's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014shoving the mother, cutting off the family, and making the funeral about herself. The user's refusal could be seen as justified because she didn't act in good faith. However, the necklace was a specific request from the father, which complicates things. \n\nBut considering the stepmom's actions, which were harmful and disrespectful, the user might not have an obligation to follow through if the request was made under a false pretense or if the stepmom is exploiting the situation. The user's friends are telling him to let go, but he's choosing not to because of the stepmom's behavior. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between honoring a parent's wishes and not enabling harmful behavior. Since the stepmom is actively causing conflict and the user has valid reasons to disengage, his choice not to give the necklace might be seen as self-preservation and protecting his family. The necklace could be viewed as a gift that the stepmom is trying to take advantage of, and the user is right to not comply given her actions. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the stepmom's behavior is inexcusable, and the user is justified in protecting his family and not enabling her after what she did.\n"
