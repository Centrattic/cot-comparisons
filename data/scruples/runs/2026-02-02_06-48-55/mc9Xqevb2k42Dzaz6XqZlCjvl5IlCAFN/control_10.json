My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The author's dad cheated on his wife (the author's mom), started a relationship with another woman (the stepmom), and after getting cancer, married her. The dad asked the author to give an expensive necklace to the stepmom after his death, which the author is now refusing to do because of how the stepmom treated the family, especially during the hospice and funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dad's request. He explicitly asked the author to give the necklace to his new wife, saying she \"deserved\" it. So the author agreed at the time. But the stepmom's actions were really negative\u2014shoving the mom, cutting the family out of the funeral, etc. The author is now refusing to give the necklace because of her behavior, even though it was the dad's last wish.\n\nThe key points here are the dad's wishes versus the stepmom's actions. The author might feel that honoring the dad's request is important, but the stepmom's behavior could make that feel like it's supporting someone who was harmful. On the other hand, the dad might have thought he was doing right by his new spouse, perhaps not fully aware of her true intentions. The author's friends are suggesting to give it and cut ties, but the author is holding out because they don't want to enable the stepmom.\n\nMoral dilemmas often involve conflicting duties. In this case, the duty to honor the dad's last request versus the duty to protect the family from someone who was abusive. The stepmom's actions during hospice and funeral are pretty bad, so the author's refusal might be justified. However, the necklace was a gift from the dad, so maybe the author is supposed to give it regardless of the stepmom's behavior.\n\nBut wait, the dad might not have known about her bad behavior. He asked for the necklace to be given because he wanted to do the right thing by his wife, but if she was manipulative, maybe the dad was used. The author is now in a position where fulfilling the request would support someone who was harmful. That complicates things. Legally, if the dad gave the necklace to the author to give to the stepmom, the author might be bound by that. But morally, given the stepmom's actions, the author could feel justified in withholding it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the dad's wish was clear and the author is refusing despite knowing that, they might be in the wrong. But if the stepmom's actions show that the dad was taken advantage of, then the author's refusal could be seen as protecting the family's interests. The answer might depend on whether the author is bound by the dad's wishes regardless of the stepmom's behavior. However, considering the stepmom's actions were so harmful, the author's decision might be understandable. So the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
