My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmother after their dad's death. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author's dad cheated on their mom, married the stepmom after the divorce, and left them in the author's life despite the stepmom trying to cut them out. The dad got cancer, told the author to give the necklace to the stepmom, but the stepmom was abusive and manipulative during the hospice time, even shoving the author's mom. The funeral was a mess, and the stepmom is now demanding the necklace. The author refuses because of her actions, but friends say they should just give it and cut ties.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the stepmom was using their dad and hurt their family, so they don't owe her the necklace. Their friends suggest giving it to avoid conflict. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not fulfilling the dad's last request.\n\nI should consider legal, moral, and emotional aspects. Legally, if the dad's will didn't specify the necklace going to the stepmom, the author might have the right to withhold it. However, if the dad explicitly asked them to give it, there's a moral obligation. Emotionally, the stepmom's behavior was abusive, which complicates things. The author's friends think they should comply, but the author refuses due to the stepmom's actions.\n\nDifferent perspectives: The author might feel justified protecting their family and not supporting the stepmom's demands. Others might argue that honoring the dad's wishes, even if the stepmom is unworthy, is important. The stepmom's manipulative behavior could be seen as a reason to not comply, especially if she's exploiting the situation.\n\nI need to weigh the dad's final wishes against the stepmom's actions. The author's refusal is based on protecting their family and not rewarding bad behavior. The stepmom's actions during the hospice were harmful, which could make the author justified in not giving the necklace. However, if the dad legally entrusted them to give it, there might be a legal obligation, but the story doesn't mention that. The author's friends suggest giving it to avoid conflict, but the author's stance is firm.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's refusal seems justified due to the stepmom's abusive behavior and the dad's possible manipulation. The author is protecting their family and not enabling the stepmom's demands, which were made through harassment and threats. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
