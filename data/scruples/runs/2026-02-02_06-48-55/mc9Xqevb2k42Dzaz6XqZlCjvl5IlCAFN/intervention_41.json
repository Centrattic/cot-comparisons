My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their stepmom. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person's dad cheated on their mom with this woman, then they got married after finding out he had cancer. The dad asked his kids to give the necklace to the new wife after he died. The stepmom acted selfishly during the hospice and funeral, even shoving the mom. Now she's harassing the kids for the necklace.\n\nThe user says they don't feel bad about not giving it because of everything the stepmom did. Some friends say to give it and move on. The user is questioning if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I should consider the dad's wishes. He asked them to give the necklace, which could be seen as a request they honored by agreeing initially. But then the stepmom's actions were terrible. The kids felt violated and hurt. The necklace might be a symbol of her betrayal because she didn't treat the family well despite the dad's request.\n\nOn one hand, fulfilling a parent's final wish is important. But on the other hand, the stepmom didn't deserve it given her actions. The kids might feel that giving the necklace would validate her behavior or reward her for being cruel. Also, the stepmom is pressuring them aggressively, which adds to the tension.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the kids' relationship with their dad. If he genuinely wanted them to give the necklace despite the stepmom's actions, maybe they should honor that. But maybe the dad was in a weakened state and didn't realize her true intentions. Alternatively, the dad might have wanted to provide for her in his final days, but the kids might see that as misguided.\n\nConsidering all this, the kids have valid reasons to not give the necklace. The stepmom's behavior was abusive and manipulative. The kids are protecting their mom and themselves. The necklace is expensive, but the stepmom's actions make the kids feel they shouldn't reward her. Friends' advice to just give it and move on might be well-intentioned, but the kids' feelings are justified given the circumstances.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have good reasons to withhold the necklace due to the stepmom's harmful actions and the dad's possible manipulation by her. The kids are standing up for their family and not being complicit in her selfish behavior.\n"
