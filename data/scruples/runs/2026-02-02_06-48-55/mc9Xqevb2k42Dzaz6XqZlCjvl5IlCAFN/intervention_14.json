My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace as per their dad's request, considering the stepmom's behavior. The stepmom cheated, the dad was manipulated, and she ended up being really hostile towards the family. The author agreed to give the necklace for the dad's sake but changed their mind after the stepmom's actions. \n\nFirst, the dad's last wish is a factor. The author was told to give the necklace, which creates a moral obligation. However, the stepmom's actions were abusive and manipulative, making her a bad person in the story. The author's friends suggest giving it to her, but the author is justified in feeling hurt and not wanting to support her.\n\nLegal perspective: If the necklace was a gift from the dad to the stepmom, then technically, the author might not have the right to withhold it. But if the dad's wishes were conditional on the stepmom's respectful actions, that's different. Since the stepmom acted out, maybe the conditions weren't met. But legally, unless there's a will specifying otherwise, the heir (the author) might be bound to follow the dad's request. However, in practice, if the dad was being manipulated, the author could argue they're protecting their dad's wishes from being exploited.\n\nEmotionally, the author has valid reasons. The stepmom was abusive, and giving the necklace might enable further harm. The author's family was wronged, so withholding the necklace could be seen as protecting their father's legacy from someone who used him. \n\nSocially, people might side with the author because the stepmom's actions were despicable. The dad might have been under pressure from her, so fulfilling the request now could be against his true intentions. However, some might argue honoring the last request is important, regardless of the recipient's behavior.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's decision is understandable. They're protecting their family and not rewarding harmful behavior. The dad's request was in the context of his illness, which might have made him vulnerable. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
