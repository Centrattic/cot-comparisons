My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The story is about a person refusing to give an expensive necklace to their stepmother after their dad's death. The dad had asked them to give it to her, but the stepmom acted badly during the hospice and funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The dad gave the necklace to the person, right? So technically, unless the dad had a will or specific instructions, the ownership of the item might be in question. But the dad asked the person to give it to the stepmom, which could be seen as a directive. However, the stepmom's behavior complicates things.\n\nThe person's friends are telling them to give it up, but they feel justified in not giving it because of the stepmom's actions. The key here is whether the dad's request creates an obligation. The person agreed to do it for his sake, but now they're reconsidering due to the stepmom's actions.\n\nEthically, honoring a deceased parent's wishes is important, but so is protecting oneself from someone who was abusive. The stepmom's actions during hospice and funeral were hostile, maybe even abusive. The person might feel that giving the necklace would be rewarding bad behavior.\n\nLegally, if the necklace was given to the person by the dad, it's their property. They aren't obligated to give it away unless there's a legal document. The stepmom can't force them to hand it over. So legally, the author might be in the right.\n\nEmotionally, the person is justified in not wanting to give the necklace to someone who caused them so much pain. The dad's request might have been clouded by his illness or his desire to please the stepmom, which doesn't necessarily mean the stepmom deserves it now.\n\nThe stepmom is being aggressive, which adds to the justification for not complying. The author's actions are self-protective and respecting their mother as well.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. The stepmom's actions and the dad's possible misguided wishes don't obligate the author to give the necklace. The answer should be B.\n"
