My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for not giving the necklace. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is complicated. The dad cheated on the mom with a woman, then married her after his wife found out. The stepmom, after the dad's diagnosis, seems to have pushed the author and their family away. There was a conflict during hospice and the funeral, where the stepmom physically shoved the mom and kept the family away. The dad asked the author to give her this expensive necklace after he died. Now the stepmom is demanding it, and the author is refusing because of her behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They feel wronged by the stepmom's actions. The stepmom was abusive during a vulnerable time, and the author is justified in protecting their mom and family. The dad's request might be seen as a way to provide for someone he loved, but the stepmom's behavior makes the author reluctant.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad explicitly asked for the necklace to be given. The author agreed to do so for his sake. Now, they're breaking that promise. But was the dad's request valid when he was under the influence of the stepmom's manipulation? Maybe he was in a weakened state and didn't realize what she was doing. The stepmom's actions don't seem to align with being deserving of the gift, especially after the conflict.\n\nThe author's main argument is about protecting their family and not rewarding someone who was abusive. The stepmom's actions were harmful, and giving her the necklace might enable further disrespect toward the family. The author's friends are saying to give it to her and move on, but the author is choosing to stand their ground.\n\nLegally, the necklace is a gift from the dad, so the author might be in a legal obligation. But morally, the stepmom's actions could negate that. The author's decision could be seen as protecting their family's well-being and honoring their dad's actual wishes if he was manipulated. Alternatively, not giving it could be seen as betraying the dad's final request.\n\nBut given the stepmom's behavior, it's possible the dad was being taken advantage of. The author might be right in not giving the necklace because the stepmom didn't deserve it after her actions. The author's refusal is to prevent her from getting something she didn't earn, especially after causing so much harm. The friends' advice to give it and cut ties might be more about avoiding conflict, but the author's stance is about justice here.\n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author's decision is understandable. They were in a tough position, and the stepmom's actions make the necklace a painful reminder. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their family's well-being and not enabling the stepmom's behavior. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
