My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his stepmother. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the father had a long-term affair, leading to a divorce. The stepmother then tried to cut the kids out, but the dad stayed in their lives. When he got cancer, he married her and gave the author a necklace to give her after his death. The stepmother later acted selfishly during hospice, shoved the author's mom, and made the funeral about herself. Now, she's harassing the author for the necklace.\n\nThe author's friends think he should give it to her and move on, but he refuses. The key points here are the father's final wish vs. the stepmother's behavior. Legally, if the necklace was given to the author by the father with the intent to give to the stepmother, then there might be an obligation. But the stepmother's actions are questionable. Ethically, it's a toss-up. The father wanted to honor her, but she didn't treat the family well. The author is torn between respecting his dad's last request and protecting his family from her.\n\nIf the necklace is the father's property and he gave it to the author to give her, then the author might be in the wrong legally for not complying. However, morally, considering her actions, the author might feel justified in withholding it. The answer depends on the legal ownership and the father's intent. Since the author is the executor here, there's a duty to follow the father's final wishes unless there's a legal reason not to. But if the stepmother is pressuring him, maybe there's a way to legally hold onto it until her behavior changes. But the author isn't in the wrong if the stepmother was using the father, and the father's judgment might have been impaired by illness. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the stepmother's actions were harmful, and the father's judgment might have been compromised. The author is protecting his family's interests against someone who took advantage of his father.\n"
