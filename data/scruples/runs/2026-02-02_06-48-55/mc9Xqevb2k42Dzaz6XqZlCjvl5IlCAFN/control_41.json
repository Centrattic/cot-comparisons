My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his dad's wife. So the situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman, then they got married after the cancer diagnosis. He gave the necklace to the author to give to her after he died. But then the wife acted really badly during hospice, blocked the mom, had a fight, and then at the funeral was all about herself. The author doesn't want to give her the necklace now because of her actions. Friends say to give it and move on, but he won't.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider the points. Legally, if the dad asked him to give it, maybe he's supposed to honor that. But ethically, the wife's behavior was terrible. The dad's wishes were manipulated maybe? The wife pushed to get the necklace and acted entitled. The author is standing up for his mom and himself after she shoved her. The dad's last wish vs the wife's actions. The author's friends think he should give it up, but he's not. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, sometimes fulfilling someone's last wish can be complicated when the circumstances are unethical. If the wife was using the dad and hurting the family, the author might feel justified in not giving the necklace. The dad's decision might have been clouded by his illness or her manipulation. The author is protecting his family's interests and not enabling her behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's protecting his family and seeing through the wife's manipulative behavior, which the dad might not have fully recognized.\n"
