My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves their dad's second wife, who they clearly have a lot of negative feelings towards. The dad asked them to give an expensive necklace to this wife after he died. The author is refusing to do so now because of the wife's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the dad gave the necklace to his daughter with the intention of passing it to the wife, then legally, the daughter might be obligated to do so. But if the necklace was part of the dad's estate, maybe there's a will or other legal documents determining that. However, the question here is about moral or ethical wrongness, not necessarily legal. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the answer should be based on that.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The wife is described as someone who tried to cut the family out, was abusive towards the mom, and was manipulative during the hospice time. The author feels that the wife doesn't deserve the necklace given her actions. The dad's request was made under the belief that she deserved it, but the author believes she was using him.\n\nThe author's friends are telling them to give it to her and move on, but the author is refusing. The key points here are the father's final wishes versus the actions of the wife and the family's perspective. The author is conflicted between honoring their dad's request and protecting their mom and themselves from someone they see as toxic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author promised their dad to give the necklace, there's a moral obligation. However, the wife's behavior could be a mitigating factor. Some might argue that fulfilling a promise to a deceased parent is important, regardless of the recipient's character. Others might say that the author isn't responsible for their parent's decisions, especially if those decisions were influenced by manipulation.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their family from someone who was abusive. The dad's request was made in his final days, possibly under the wife's influence, which could affect the validity of the request. However, the author did agree to the request \"for his sake,\" which could imply a promise. But given the circumstances, the author is standing up for their mom and not enabling the wife's behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, it's more likely the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
