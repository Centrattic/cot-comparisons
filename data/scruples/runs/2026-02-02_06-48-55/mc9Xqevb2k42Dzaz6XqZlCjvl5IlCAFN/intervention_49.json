My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace as per their dad's request. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated, married his mistress, and asked the kids to give her an expensive necklace after he died. The stepmom then acted cruelly during his hospice care, shoved the mom, and excluded them from the funeral. Now she's harassing the author for the necklace.\n\nSo, legally, if the dad gave the necklace to the author to give to his wife, there might be a legal obligation. But emotionally, the author is clearly hurt by her actions. The friends are saying to give it to her, but the author is standing their ground. \n\nThe key points here are: the dad's request versus the stepmom's behavior. The author might feel that fulfilling the dad's wish would validate the stepmom's actions, especially after how she treated the family. On the other hand, not giving it might break the dad's final wish. \n\nBut considering the stepmom's actions\u2014excluding the family, being abusive\u2014it's understandable why the author doesn't want to give it. The dad might have been manipulated, or maybe he genuinely believed she deserved it despite her behavior. The author is in a tough spot between honoring the dad's wish and protecting their family's well-being. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They have valid reasons to not give the necklace, especially after the stepmom's actions. The dad might have been mistaken in his judgment, but the author isn't obligated to follow a request that seems to enable abuse. So the answer is B.\n"
