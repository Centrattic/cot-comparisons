My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to their stepmother as requested by their late father. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The father cheated on the mom, married the stepmother after the divorce, and then got sick. Before dying, he asked the author to give his wife an expensive necklace. The stepmother was hostile towards the author's mom and family, even pushing her and keeping them from the hospice visit. The funeral was also problematic, with her putting down the mom and not including the author's family. Now she's demanding the necklace, and the author refuses.\n\nThe key points here are the father's request versus the stepmother's behavior. The author is torn between honoring their dad's wish and protecting their mom. The stepmother's actions were clearly harmful, especially the physical aggression towards the author's mom. That's a big red flag.\n\nThe author's friends are telling them to give it up, but they're choosing not to. The question is whether they're in the wrong. Legally, if the father gave the necklace to the stepmother before he died, the author might be in the wrong by withholding it. But ethically, it's a gray area. The stepmother's behavior might make the author feel justified in not giving it, especially if they believe the father was manipulated.\n\nBut the author did agree to give it for his sake. The father's last wishes are hard to ignore. However, if the stepmother was using the father and causing harm to the family, maybe the author isn't wrong in withholding the necklace. The father's request might have been made under circumstances where he was vulnerable.\n\nSo, there's a conflict between honoring the father's wishes and protecting family from someone harmful. The author's mom was physically harmed, which adds weight to the decision to not give the necklace. The stepmother's actions post-father's death also show a lack of respect for the family, which could justify the author's refusal.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's complicated. Legally, there might be an obligation, but ethically, the author's stance is understandable given the stepmother's behavior. The stepmother's actions post-death seem to confirm that she's not deserving of the necklace, despite the father's request. The author's decision might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their family and preventing the stepmother from benefiting from her harmful actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
