My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman. They split up, the dad let her live with him, and she tried to cut the family out. The dad didn't give in and stayed in their lives. Then he got cancer, married her, and before dying gave the author an expensive necklace to give her, saying she deserved it. The author agreed for the dad's sake.\n\nBut then, during hospice, the stepmom didn't let the mom see the dad, shoved her, and made the funeral all about herself. The author is now refusing to give her the necklace because of her behavior. Friends say to give it and move on, but the author refuses.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The necklace was the dad's last request. On one hand, the dad did ask him to give it to her. On the other hand, the stepmom acted badly, even physically assaulted the author's mom. The author is justified in feeling that she doesn't deserve it now after her actions.\n\nLegal perspective: The dad owned the necklace. He could have given it to her or to the author. If he asked the author to give it, technically, the author might be fulfilling his wish. But if the dad didn't make a legal will, maybe the necklace is part of his estate. If the stepmom is the surviving spouse, she might have a claim. But in some places, the family might have rights too. However, the author might not be legally obligated to give it if the dad didn't put it in a will.\n\nEmotionally and morally, the stepmom's actions were\u6076\u52a3. Shoving the mom and cutting the family out. The author's refusal could be seen as protecting their family's interests against someone abusive. The dad might have wanted to honor her, but he might not have known the full extent of her behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had a valid reason to question the stepmom's intentions, especially after her actions. The dad's request is important, but the circumstances might make the author's decision reasonable. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
