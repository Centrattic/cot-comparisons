My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his dad's wife. The scenario is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman. After splitting up, the dad let her live with him, but she tried to cut the family out. The dad still stayed in their lives. Then he got pancreatic cancer, married her, and gave the necklace to the author to give to her after he died. The stepmom acted badly during hospice, including shoving the mom and keeping the family away. The funeral was also a mess with her being rude. Now, the stepmom is hounding the author for the necklace.\n\nThe author's friends say to give it and be done, but the author refuses. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: Was the necklace the dad's to give? The dad asked him to give it to her, so there's a promise involved. But the stepmom's actions were terrible. The author feels she doesn't deserve it after how she treated the family.\n\nOn one hand, the dad's last request is a factor. If the dad wanted to give the necklace, maybe the author is bound by that. But on the other hand, the stepmom's behavior was abusive, and the author isn't getting professional help, just using the dad's request. \n\nBut the dad had the chance to make it official, like in a will or something. If he didn't, maybe the author isn't obligated. Also, the stepmom was manipulative, maybe using the dad's guilt to get the necklace. The author might be protecting his family's interests here.\n\nHmm. So, even though the dad asked, if there's no legal obligation, the author might not be in the wrong for not giving it. Especially considering the stepmom's actions. But some might say honoring the dad's wish is important regardless. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the dad's request was binding. Since it was a verbal request, maybe not legally, but morally? The author could argue that the stepmom's actions invalidate the request. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. He's standing up against someone who was abusive, and the dad's request might have been clouded by the stepmom's influence. So answer B.\n"
