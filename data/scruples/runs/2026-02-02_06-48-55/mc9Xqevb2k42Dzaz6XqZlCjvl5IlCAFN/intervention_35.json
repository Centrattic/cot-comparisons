  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not giving my dad's wife the stupidly expensive necklace he wanted me to give her after he passed away?\nThrowaway because some friends follow my main account.\n\nBasically my dad cheated on my mom with this woman. My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace to his stepmom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dad cheated on the mom with this woman. Then, after splitting up, the dad started living with the woman. The woman tried to push the author and his family out, but the dad stayed in their lives. Later, the dad gets pancreatic cancer, marries the woman, and gives the author an expensive necklace to give her after his death. The author agreed because it was the dad's request.\n\nBut during hospice, the stepmom didn't let the mom in, pushed her, and kept the family away. The funeral was also a mess with the stepmom being rude. Now, the stepmom is asking for the necklace daily, even showing up at school. The author refuses to give it because of her bad behavior and feels she doesn't deserve it.\n\nThe author's friends say to give it and move on, but he's standing his ground. The question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the dad made a request, and fulfilling it could be seen as respecting his wishes. But the stepmom's actions were terrible, manipulating the situation and hurting the family. The author's refusal could be justified as protecting himself and his family from someone who's abusive. The necklace was a gift, but given under circumstances where the recipient's behavior was harmful. \n\nIf the dad knew her true nature, maybe he would have changed his mind. The author isn't legally obligated to give it, and morally, given her actions, it's a personal choice. So, it's a tough call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because of the stepmom's behavior and the dad's possible manipulation by her. The key points are the stepmom's harmful actions and the dad's possibly clouded judgment at the end. So the answer might be B.\n"
