My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving their stepmom an expensive necklace their dad wanted them to give after he died. The dad cheated on their mom, stayed in contact with the stepmom, married her, and then their stepmom acted really poorly at the end, even pushing their mom and causing a scene. The stepmom is now demanding the necklace, which the person refuses to give because of her behavior.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: If the dad explicitly asked for the necklace to be given to her, there might be a legal obligation unless there's a will that says otherwise. But the user mentioned there's no will mentioned here, so maybe it's a verbal request. Depending on jurisdiction, verbal instructions might not be binding. But without a will, it's unclear. However, the stepmom might claim it's a gift from the dad to her, so the user could be keeping someone else's property. But if the dad gave it to the user to give her, maybe it's still the stepmom's property. Legally, this is a gray area. But the user might have a defense if they can argue the dad was coerced or under undue influence when making the request.\n\nMoral perspective: The user's dad wanted them to give the necklace and be nice. However, the stepmom's actions were abusive\u2014shoving the mom, excluding them from the funeral, etc. The user doesn't want to support someone who harmed their family. There's a conflict between honoring the dad's last wishes and protecting their family from someone who caused harm. The user's reasoning is that the stepmom was using the dad and didn't care about the family. So morally, some might side with the user, especially if the stepmom was toxic.\n\nThe friends and the stepmom's actions are pressuring the user. The user feels justified because of the stepmom's behavior. The stepmom's actions after the dad's death were hostile and vindictive, which could make the user's refusal more understandable. The necklace could be seen as a way for the stepmom to gain more from the dad's death, which the user refuses to enable.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the user is standing by their decision, and the stepmom's actions were problematic. The user is protecting their family and not giving in to someone who caused harm. While there's a technical request from the dad, the context of the stepmom's behavior complicates it. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong because the stepmom's actions were harmful, and the necklace's gift might not be justified given her behavior. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
