My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not giving the expensive necklace to their dad's wife after he passed away. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The dad cheated on the mom, married the stepmom after finding out he had cancer, gave the author the necklace to give to her, and asked them to be nice. But the stepmom was hostile towards the family, physically assaulted the mom, and excluded them from the funeral. Now she's demanding the necklace, and the author refuses.\n\nThe author's friends are telling them to give it to her, but they feel justified in not doing so because of the stepmom's behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not honoring their dad's last request under these circumstances.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the dad explicitly asked for the necklace to be given to the stepmom, and there's no will or legal document contradicting that, the author might be bound by that request. However, the stepmom's actions might affect that. If there's a will, it could override the request. But the story doesn't mention a will, so it's unclear. If there's no will, the author might have a say, especially if they feel the request was under undue influence or manipulation by the stepmom.\n\nMorally, the author is torn between honoring their dad's wishes and protecting themselves and their mother from a harmful person. The stepmom's behavior\u2014shoving the mom, excluding the family from the funeral, and being disrespectful\u2014could be seen as grounds for not fulfilling the request. The author might feel that giving the necklace would validate the stepmom's actions or reward her for her behavior.\n\nAnother angle: the dad's request might have been influenced by his desire to reconcile with the stepmom during his final days. However, the stepmom's actions post-diagnosis suggest she may not have had the best interests of the family in mind. The author's decision could be seen as protecting their family's well-being.\n\nThere's also the aspect of emotional and psychological harm caused by the stepmom. The author's refusal could be a way of standing up against the abuse their mom and family endured. In that case, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their family's emotional health over a material item.\n\nBut if the dad's request was a legal or binding one (like in a will), then not following it might be considered wrong. Since the story doesn't mention any legal documents, it's hard to say. However, if the dad didn't formalize his request, the author might have the right to choose, especially given the stepmom's behavior.\n\nIn terms of social perception, some might argue the author is in the right for not enabling the stepmom's actions, while others might feel the dad's final wish should be respected regardless. The stepmom's actions definitely paint her in a negative light, which could support the author's stance.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're responding to a harmful situation and prioritizing their family's well-being over a gift from a dying father, which might have been manipulated by the stepmom. The answer would be B (No).\n"
