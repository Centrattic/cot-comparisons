My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author's dad cheated on their mom with another woman. The dad and this woman got married after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Before he died, he gave the author an expensive necklace and asked them to give it to his new wife after he passed away. The author agreed for their dad's sake. However, the stepmother was very difficult during his final days, keeping the family away, even shoving the author's mom. At the funeral, she tried to cut them out and acted disrespectfully. Now, the stepmother is harassing the author to get the necklace, and the author is refusing to give it to her, feeling they don't owe her anything. The author's friends are pressuring them to give it to her, but the author is against it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the necklace.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the dad gave the necklace to the author as a gift and instructed them to give it to his wife, then the author is the owner and can decide not to give it. However, if the dad had given the necklace to the wife through the author, it might be different. But since the dad asked the author to give it to her after he died, that could be seen as a bequest or a request. But if the author is the owner, then they have the right to refuse. \n\nMorally, the author is torn between honoring their dad's last wish and the stepmother's bad behavior. The stepmother's actions during and after the dad's illness were hostile and even violent. The author might feel justified in not giving the necklace because of this. However, the dad explicitly asked for it, which could put the author in a dilemma. \n\nThe friends' opinions suggest that maybe the author should give it to her and move on, but the author is standing by their decision. The stepmother's behavior might have made the author's choice more understandable. The key points here are the dad's request versus the stepmother's actions. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often considers intent and context. The author is not legally obligated to give the necklace if they own it, and the stepmother's behavior might justify the refusal. The dad's request is important, but if the stepmother was abusive, the author might feel that honoring the request is not necessary. \n\nSo, I think the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are protecting themselves from an abusive situation and have the right to refuse giving the necklace, especially if they are the rightful owner and the stepmother's actions were harmful.\n"
