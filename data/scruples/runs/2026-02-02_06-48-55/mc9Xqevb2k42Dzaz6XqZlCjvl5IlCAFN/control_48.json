My mom found out and they split up, then he started letting this woman live with him. She slowly tried to cut us out of the picture. Luckily my dad didn't give into her shit and stayed in our lives.\n\nMy dad got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 9 months ago. After he found out, he decided to marry her. And shortly after they got married he went downhill really fast. Before he went to the hospital for the last time he talked to me straight up about what was happening and he gave me a luxury brand/expensive diamond and emerald necklace for her. He asked me to give it to her after he passed away and that she \"deserved\" it. He also asked me to be nice to her and keep in touch with her after he died. I agreed for his sake.\n\nIt went down when he went into hospice. He told his wife that he wanted me and my brother at his side and he wanted one last visit with my mom because he felt guilty. His wife pretended to go along with what he was saying, but she never told us that he went into hospice. We had to find out through one of my dad's coworkers. When we showed up, she let us in but refused to let my mom in. They argued and this bitch put hands on my mom and shoved her, after which I stepped in and shoved her back. My mom told me that she would leave because we should be with my dad, and left. We were with him for maybe 40 minutes before she made us leave because we were \"stressing him out\" (he was barely conscious and holding my hand tightly). He died an hour later.\n\nThe funeral was a mess. She took every effort to cut us out of the funeral, refused to have any pictures that had us in the slideshow, and said more nasty things about my mom and her marriage to my dad infront of me and my brother. I told her to fuck off and that I wasn't going to the funeral because the way she treated us made me sick. My brother went, and she basically made the entire show all about her and her professional accomplishments that she'd made since hooking up with my dad. \n\nThat was a month ago. Apparently she's heard rumors about this necklace and guessed I have it. She's been hitting me up nonstop about it and saying stuff like she thinks my dad bought it for her, and I'd better give it to her \"NOW\". I sent her one text saying \"I don't know what you're talking about\" and left it. She's calling me and texting every day about it-- even visiting me at school, looking for me, to get her hands on it.\n\nI don't owe her shit. I don't feel bad about not giving her this stupid necklace after everything she did. Some of my friends are telling me to give it to her and wash my hands of it, but I refuse to do it. It was my dad's last wish, but it's become so clear that she was just using him and didn't care about who she hurt to get what she wanted. \n\nSo..I dunno. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not giving the necklace as requested. So, first, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe dad cheated on the mom with another woman, who later became his wife. The author and their brother felt this stepmom was trying to cut them out. The dad, after getting cancer, asked the author to give an expensive necklace to his new wife after he died. But then, the stepmom was really hostile during the hospice and funeral, even shoving the mom and cutting them out. Now she's demanding the necklace.\n\nSo the author is holding onto the necklace and refusing to give it to her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The dad's last wish was to give the necklace to his wife. On one hand, honoring a parent's last request might be seen as a duty. But on the other hand, the stepmom's behavior was abusive and hurtful. The author and their family were mistreated during a very sensitive time. The stepmom is now being aggressive about getting the necklace.\n\nMoral obligations can be tricky. If the dad explicitly asked for it, maybe the author is supposed to fulfill that. But if the stepmom was manipulative or the dad was under her influence, maybe not. The fact that the dad was in hospice and the stepmom was controlling the situation raises questions about whether the request was made under pressure or if the dad was still in his right mind.\n\nAlso, the stepmom's actions during the hospice and funeral were hostile. The author might feel justified in not giving her the necklace, especially since her behavior was so terrible. The necklace could be seen as a reward for her actions, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nLegal perspective: If the necklace is part of the dad's estate, the author might not have legal claim unless it's willed to them. But since it was given directly to the author by the dad, maybe it's considered a gift that the author can choose to keep. However, if the dad intended it for the wife, then the author might be legally required to give it. But if it was given to the author as a personal gift, then maybe not. The legal aspect is a bit unclear here, but the user is asking about being \"in the wrong\" morally or socially.\n\nSocially, people might have different opinions. Some might say the author should honor their dad's last wish regardless, others might say the stepmom's behavior justifies not giving it. The friends are split. The author's stance is that the stepmom didn't deserve it after her actions, and the dad was possibly manipulated.\n\nIn terms of emotional impact, the author and their mom were mistreated. The necklace might symbolize a betrayal of their dad's memory if given to the stepmom. The author's decision could be seen as protecting their family's feelings and refusing to reward bad behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The stepmom's actions were egregious, and the necklace was given in a context where the dad might have been under her influence or not thinking clearly. The author's refusal is more about standing up for their family and honoring their dad's memory differently. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
