I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a sister who didn't get the Gardasil vaccine and her brother publicly shaming her for being an anti-vaxxer. She cut off her brother after he wouldn't take down the post unless she got vaccinated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister missed the Gardasil vaccine at 14 because she didn't want a needle. Now, she's decided not to get it because she's out of the effective age window, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom didn't explain this to her brother, who then posted about her, leading to the sister cutting off contact.\n\nThe main issue is whether she was wrong to cut off her brother. The brother's public post seems harsh and possibly untrue, as she's not an anti-vaxxer. She's made a reasoned decision based on medical advice. The brother is using his kids as an excuse to cut her off, but she didn't ask to be part of their lives. The sister's response was to stop all contact, which is a strong move, but given the public shaming, maybe justified.\n\nThe mother's reaction says she's too harsh, but the brother's actions were inconsiderate. The sister's decision to cut off contact might be seen as self-respecting her own circumstances. However, some might argue that cutting off a family member is extreme. But the brother's public shaming without full context was a breach of trust. The sister's actions are a defense of her autonomy and privacy.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the sister might not be in the wrong. The brother's public post was inappropriate, and her cutting him off is a response to his violation of trust and misinformation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
