I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their brother after he publicly criticized them for not having the Gardasil vaccine. \n\nFirst, the author hasn't had all their vaccines. They opted out of Gardasil at 14 because they didn't want a needle and later decided not to get it because they're past the effective age, don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. Their mom agreed with their decision but didn't explain it properly to the brother. The brother then made a public Facebook post calling the author an \"anti-vaxxer\" and refusing contact unless she gets vaccinated. The author cut off the brother, and the mom thinks they're being too harsh. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nNow, considering the facts. Gardasil is recommended for both males and females to prevent HPV, which can lead to various cancers. The author's reasoning is that they're beyond the effectiveness window and don't have HPV, so the vaccine wouldn't help now. The brother is concerned about his kids' safety, which is understandable. However, the brother's approach was to publicly shame the author instead of discussing privately. The author's response was to cut off the brother, which might be seen as harsh, but the brother's public post was likely more hurtful. \n\nThe key points: Did the author do something wrong? They made a personal medical decision, which they discussed with their mom but not the brother. The brother's public shaming is problematic. The author cutting off the brother could be seen as a reaction to public humiliation and lack of respect. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether cutting off a family member over a vaccine issue is justified. But the brother's actions were more aggressive. The author's decision might be harsh, but not necessarily wrong given the context. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
