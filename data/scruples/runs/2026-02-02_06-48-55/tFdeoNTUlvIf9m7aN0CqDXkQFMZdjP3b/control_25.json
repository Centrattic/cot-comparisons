I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sibling cutting off another sibling because they refused a vaccine, specifically Gardasil. The person in question hasn't had the Gardasil vaccine and the brother is publicizing this, calling them an anti-vaxxer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the medical aspect. The user mentions they opted out of Gardasil at 14, not realizing it later. Now they're choosing not to get it because it's less effective after certain age, they don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. The brother is concerned about protecting his kids from HPV, leading to the public post.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's right to protect his children and the sister's right to her medical decisions. The brother's public shaming could be seen as overstepping. The sister feels disrespected and decides to cut off contact, which the mother thinks is harsh. \n\nI need to consider if the sister's decision to cut off the brother is justified. The brother's public post was confrontational and possibly hurtful. The sister had explained her reasoning, but the brother didn't engage in a private, respectful dialogue. Instead, he used public shaming, which might have crossed a line. The sister's cut-off could be a response to being disrespected publicly and feeling unsupported. The fact that the sister had discussed the matter with her mother and had a valid medical rationale might support her stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's concern is about his children's health. However, the sister argues that Gardasil's effectiveness window has passed for her and that transmission risk is low. The brother's insistence on vaccination as a condition for maintaining a relationship might be seen as extreme. The sister's decision to end the relationship could be a justified reaction to public shaming and disrespect.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the sister's actions are a response to being publicly shamed without a respectful discussion. The brother's public post likely escalated the situation unnecessarily. Therefore, the sister isn't in the wrong here.\n"
