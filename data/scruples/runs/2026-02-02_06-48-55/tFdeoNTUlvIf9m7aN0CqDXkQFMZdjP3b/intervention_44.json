I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the person (the author) hasn't had the Gardasil vaccine. They weren't aware they missed it until recently. They decided not to get it now because they're past the effective age, don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. Their mom told their brother, who then insisted the author should be fully vaccinated before being around his kids. The brother posted publicly calling the author an anti-vaxxer. The author got angry, cut off the brother, and the mom thinks they're being too harsh.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author's decision not to get Gardasil is based on medical reasoning. They had a valid reason when they were 14 and now are informed about the effectiveness window. The brother, however, is publicizing this without understanding the context, which might be an overreaction. The author cutting off the brother because of this public post could be seen as a strong reaction, but maybe justified if the brother was being inconsiderate.\n\nThe key points are: the author's decision is medically informed, the brother didn't fully understand the situation, and the author's response was to cut off contact. The author's actions might be a justified stand against public shaming, especially if the brother was misrepresenting their stance. The mom's opinion might not be the best here since she didn't explain the full context to the brother.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. Their reasoning is valid, and the brother's public post was hurtful and based on incomplete information. Choosing to set boundaries by cutting off the brother could be seen as self-respect and protecting their own stance. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
