I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their brother after he publicly criticized them for not having the Gardasil vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author didn't get Gardasil when they were 14 because they didn't want another needle. Now they're older, and they're told the vaccine isn't effective for them anymore. They don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. They discussed this with their mom, who agreed. The brother didn't get the full context and posted publicly calling the author an anti-vaxxer. The author got angry, told the brother to take it down, and when he refused, they cut off all contact. The mom thinks they're being too harsh. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but wants to know what I think.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother's public accusation without full information, the author's decision not to take the vaccine due to personal reasons, and the response of cutting off the brother. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's decision not to get Gardasil is based on medical reasoning\u2014age beyond the effectiveness window, no HPV, and husband is vaccinated. They also tried to explain their stance, but the brother didn't listen and made a public post. The author felt disrespected and decided to cut ties. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's action was public shaming, which can be hurtful. However, the author's response of cutting off the brother completely might be seen as extreme. The mom's opinion that it's too harsh suggests that there's a middle ground. \n\nBut the brother's public post was disrespectful and didn't account for the author's reasons. The author had a right to be upset, especially if they felt their privacy was invaded or their decisions mischaracterized. The author's decision to cut off the brother might be a reaction to protect their own dignity, not just about the vaccine. However, cutting off a sibling entirely over this might be seen as a strong reaction. \n\nBut considering that the brother was publicizing a personal health choice without full context, the author's response could be justified. The brother's actions were public and hurtful, and the author felt they had to set boundaries. The author's decision to stop all contact could be seen as self-respect rather than being harsh. \n\nBut maybe the author could have tried to communicate better with the brother first, instead of cutting off immediately. However, the brother refused to take down the post even after being asked, so the author might not have felt they had a choice. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The brother's actions were more harmful, and the author had a right to set boundaries after being misrepresented publicly. The author's reasons for not getting the vaccine are valid, and the brother's public shaming was inappropriate. The author's response, while drastic, was a reaction to protect their own reputation and family support, given that the brother wouldn't back down.\n"
