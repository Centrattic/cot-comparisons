I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a sibling conflict over vaccination. The author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine because she was 14 when the doctor asked and she said no. Now, she's an adult and the doctor mentioned she's out of the window for effectiveness, she doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom agreed with her decision, but her brother found out and made a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer and threatening not to let her be around his kids unless she gets vaccinated. The author cut off her brother, and now she's asking if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the medical aspect. Gardasil is for preventing HPV, which can lead to certain cancers. The author chose not to get it as a teen and now is past the recommended age. Her reasoning is that she's out of the effectiveness window, she doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. So from a medical standpoint, maybe she's right to think it's unnecessary now. But her brother is concerned about his kids, thinking she's an anti-vaxxer, which isn't true. \n\nThen there's the family conflict. The brother made a public post without fully understanding her reasons. The author felt hurt and cut off contact. The mom thinks she's being too harsh. The key here is whether the author overreacted. She did explain her reasoning, but her brother didn't listen and went public. The author's response was to cut off all contact, which is a big step. \n\nIs cutting off a sibling over this considered too harsh? It depends on the context. If the brother was trying to protect his children, maybe his stance is from a place of safety. But he misrepresented her by calling her anti-vax, which is a false label. The author's decision isn't against vaccines in general; she just missed one. The brother's public shaming could have damaged her reputation, so her cutting off might be a justified boundary. \n\nBut is she in the wrong for cutting off contact? If the brother was using his kids as leverage, that's problematic. The author might feel her autonomy is being violated. However, cutting off family entirely because of a public post might be extreme. The question is about whether her actions are justified. \n\nSome might say she overreacted, but others might support her for standing up against public shaming. So, I'm a bit torn. The brother's actions were definitely wrong, but the author's response could be seen as too harsh. However, if the brother was using his kids to pressure her, maybe the author is justified. The answer might depend on the cultural context and norms around family and medical decisions. \n\nI think the brother is more in the wrong here, but the author's action of cutting off might be extreme. However, since the brother was the one who publicly shamed her, the author's response is a defense of her autonomy. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But the question is whether she is in the wrong. Answering A or B depends on weighing the public shaming versus the decision to cut off. I think B (not in the wrong) is more accurate here.\n"
