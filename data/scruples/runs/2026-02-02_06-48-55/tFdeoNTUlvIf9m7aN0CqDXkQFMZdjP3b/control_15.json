I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The question is about cutting off a brother after he publicly criticized her for not having the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author hasn't had all her vaccines. She missed Gardasil at 14 because she didn't want a needle. Now, she's decided not to get it because she's beyond the effective age, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. She talked to her mom, who agreed, but her brother found out and made a public Facebook post calling her an \"anti vaxxer\" and threatening not to let her around his kids. She cut off contact, and her mom is upset, thinking she's too harsh. So the user wants to know if she's in the wrong.\n\nBreaking it down: The brother is prioritizing his kids' health, which is understandable. Gardasil protects against HPV, which can lead to certain cancers. However, the author's reasoning for not getting it now is valid. HPV vaccine is most effective when given before sexual activity, and if she's not in a position where she could transmit it, maybe it's a personal choice. But the brother's public shaming is the key issue here.\n\nThe brother's actions\u2014publicly calling her an anti-vaxxer\u2014might be an overreaction. He didn't give her a chance to explain her reasons publicly. Public shaming can damage family relationships. The author's response is to cut off all contact and support. That's a significant step, but if the brother was disrespectful, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe mom thinks the author is too harsh, but maybe she didn't consider the brother's public post being inappropriate. The author's decision to stop helping is a boundary she's setting, which might be necessary after being shamed. The brother's insistence on vaccination as a condition for her being around his kids could be based on fear, but making it public might be crossing a line.\n\nSo, the author's actions are a response to public disrespect and not wanting to be treated as an anti-vaxxer when she's not. The brother's behavior is the problem here. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries; he's the one who initiated public conflict. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
