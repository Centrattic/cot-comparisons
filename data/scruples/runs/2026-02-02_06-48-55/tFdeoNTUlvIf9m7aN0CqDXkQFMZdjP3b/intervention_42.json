I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off her brother because he called her an anti-vaxxer on Facebook and she decided not to get the Gardasil vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine because she was 14 and didn't want a shot, and now she's decided against it because she's past the effective age, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her brother publicized her on Facebook as an anti-vaxxer, which she says is misleading because she's pro-vax otherwise. She cut off her brother for that, and her mom thinks she's too harsh. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nThe key points here are: the brother's public post, the author's reasons for not getting the vaccine, and the consequences of cutting off the brother. \n\nThe brother's actions: He made a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer. That's a public shaming, which can be hurtful. The author's response was to cut off all contact. Is that too harsh? The brother's stance might be about protecting his kids, but his method of public shaming is questionable. \n\nThe author's reasoning: She's not anti-vax, just missing one vaccine. Her reasons are based on medical advice (age, effectiveness, no HPV, husband vaccinated). If her doctor supports her decision, that's a valid medical judgment. The brother didn't engage in a discussion but went public, which might be more about his own anxiety than factual accuracy.\n\nThe mom's opinion is that the author is too harsh. But maybe the mom didn't back up the author's decision properly. The brother's public post could be seen as bullying, and the author's cut-off is a form of self-respect, not just anger. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting off a sibling is a big step. But if the brother's actions were malicious and not based on a real threat (since the author's risk of transmitting HPV is low), maybe she's justified. \n\nSo the author's actions are a response to public shaming and not a medical issue. The brother's public post is more offensive than her decision not to get the vaccine. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground, but she chose to cut off all contact. \n\nWait, but maybe the author should have given the brother a chance to take the post down without cutting ties, or tried to explain better. But she did ask him to take it down and he refused. Then she cut off. It's a conflict between family and personal principles. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. However, from an ethical standpoint, the brother's public shaming is more problematic than the author's decision. The author's cut-off is a consequence of the brother's actions. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
