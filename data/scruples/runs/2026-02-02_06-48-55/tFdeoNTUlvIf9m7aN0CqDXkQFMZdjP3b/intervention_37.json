I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about cutting off a brother after he criticized her for not getting the Gardasil vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author missed the Gardasil vaccine at 14 because she didn't want the needle, and now she's decided not to get it because she's past the effective age, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom agreed with her, but the brother found out and made a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer. She cut him off, and her mom thinks she's too harsh. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, is the author in the right? Let's consider both sides. The author's reasoning seems logical medically. Gardasil is more effective when given before potential exposure, and she's over that age. Her husband being vaccinated reduces transmission risk. The brother's public shaming could be seen as overstepping, especially if he didn't fully understand her reasoning. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's concern is about his children's health. But the author didn't pose a risk, and his public accusation was damaging. She cut him off, which might be a strong reaction, but considering his public shaming after private discussion, maybe justified. \n\nThe author did communicate her stance and was reasonable. The brother didn't engage in a respectful dialogue but went public. Her cutting off ties is a personal choice, but given the context, maybe not wrong. The mom's criticism suggests she might see the author's reaction as too harsh, but the brother's actions were worse. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. She had valid medical reasons, communicated clearly, and the brother's public shaming was the real issue. So the answer should be B.\n"
