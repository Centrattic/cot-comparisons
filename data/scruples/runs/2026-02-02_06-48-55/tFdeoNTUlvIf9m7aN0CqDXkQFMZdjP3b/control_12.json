I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their brother after he publicly called them an anti-vaxxer because they didn't get the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine when they were 14 because they didn't want another shot. Now, when their doctor mentioned it, they decided against getting it because they're past the effectiveness window, don't have HPV, and their husband's vaccinated. Their mom agreed, but the brother found out and made a public Facebook post about the sister being an anti-vaxxer, which the author took as cutting them off. The author then cut off the brother, and the question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the decision not to get Gardasil and the brother's reaction. The author's reasons seem medical and informed, considering effectiveness window and their current status. The brother's post was public and potentially damaging, which led to the author cutting off the relationship. \n\nIs the author wrong for cutting off their brother? Well, the author's decision not to get Gardasil isn't about opposing vaccines in general but a specific personal choice. The brother's public shaming might be the issue here. The author felt hurt and decided to cut ties, which can be a personal choice. Whether that's wrong depends on context like the relationship's value and the brother's actions.\n\nThe mom agreed with the author's decision but maybe didn't explain it well to the brother. The brother's insistence on vaccination for the kids' safety might be overstepping, especially if the author's choice doesn't actually pose a risk. The public Facebook post seems like an overreaction, and the author's response is cutting off someone who was previously supportive. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author's actions are about self-respect and boundaries after being publicly shamed. The brother's actions were harmful, so the author's cutting off ties is a response to that. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer might be B (No).\n"
