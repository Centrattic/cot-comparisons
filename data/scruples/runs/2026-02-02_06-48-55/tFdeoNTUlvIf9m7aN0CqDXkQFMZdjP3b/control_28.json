I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sibling cutting off another because of a vaccination issue.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author hasn't had the Gardasil vaccine, which protects against HPV. They decided against it when they were 14 and now, as an adult, have chosen not to get it because they're past the optimal age, don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. The mom told the brother, who then made a public Facebook post calling the author an \"anti vaxxer\" and insisted she get vaccinated before seeing his kids. The author cut off the brother, and the mom thinks they're being too harsh.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author isn't anti-vax; they've had all vaccines except Gardasil. The brother's concern is about protecting his kids, but the author's reasoning for not getting Gardasil seems valid medically. The brother's public shaming and ultimatum might be excessive. The author's response of cutting off the brother is a strong action, but maybe justified given the public humiliation and the brother's refusal to take the post down.\n\nThe key factors here are medical advice (the author's decision based on doctor's input), the brother's overreaction, and the public nature of his post. The author isn't anti-vax, so the brother's labeling is incorrect. The author's cut-off could be a self-defense move against public shaming and disrespect, especially after supporting the brother and his kids. The mom's side is that the author is too harsh, but the brother's actions might have been more at fault.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The brother's public accusation and ultimatum were probably the bigger issues here. The author had the right to set boundaries after being publicly shamed without accurate information.\n"
