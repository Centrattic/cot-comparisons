I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister cutting off her brother because he publicized that she's unvaccinated, specifically missing the Gardasil vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author hasn't had the Gardasil vaccine, which is for HPV. She says she opted out when she was 14 and now chooses not to get it because she's past the effective age, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. She thinks it's not a risk to her brother's kids. The brother, however, is concerned enough to make a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer and demands she get vaccinated before seeing his kids. The author then cuts him off, and the mom thinks she's too harsh.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide if she's in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me consider the key points. Publicizing someone's medical information without consent is a big issue. The brother made a public post about her vaccination status, which is personal. Even if he's concerned about his kids, sharing that info without her permission could be a privacy violation. The author's response was to cut off all contact and support, which might be seen as extreme, but maybe justified if the brother breached her privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's stance is about protecting his children. He might genuinely believe Gardasil is necessary for prevention, even if the author thinks she's not a risk. But he didn't fully explain her reasoning when he talked to others, leading to misunderstandings. \n\nThe author's decision to cut him off is a response to being publicly shamed. She had supported him before, and this might be a breaking point. The question is whether her reaction is too harsh. If the brother violated her privacy, then her response could be justified. But if the brother was within his rights to express his concerns, then maybe the author overreacted.\n\nIn the US, sharing medical information without consent can be a HIPAA violation if it's a healthcare provider, but since it's family, maybe it's a different context. However, public shaming on Facebook is a form of social pressure that can damage relationships. The author's right to privacy versus the brother's right to protect his children.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about Gardasil: she's beyond the effectiveness window, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. So her risk of transmitting HPV is low. The brother's demand might be based on a misunderstanding of the vaccine's role. \n\nSo, the brother's public post without her consent is problematic. The author cutting him off is a strong measure, but maybe justified given the public shaming and breach of trust. The mother's opinion that she's too harsh might not consider the violation of privacy.\n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong. The brother's actions were more harmful, and her response, while drastic, is a reaction to that. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
