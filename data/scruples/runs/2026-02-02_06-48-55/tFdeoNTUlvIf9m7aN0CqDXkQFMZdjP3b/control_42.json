I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a sibling conflict over the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author hasn't had the Gardasil vaccine. They skipped it at 14 because they didn't want another needle and later decided not to get it because they're out of the effective age, don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. Their mom agreed but didn't explain fully to her brother. The brother then posts on Facebook calling his sister an anti-vaxxer, and the author cuts off contact. The mom is upset, but the author feels justified.\n\nNow, considering the facts: Gardasil is for HPV prevention, which is most effective when given before potential exposure. The author isn't at risk of transmitting HPV, so the vaccine's necessity for her is questionable. The brother's public shaming without understanding her reasoning seems harsh. The author's decision to cut off the brother might be seen as a reaction to his public embarrassment and refusal to communicate privately. \n\nHowever, family dynamics are tricky. The brother is concerned about his kids' safety, which is a valid concern. But the way he handled it\u2014public accusation without dialogue\u2014could be seen as overreacting. The author's response of cutting off contact is a strong stance but might be justified given the public humiliation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the brother's actions were respectful and the author's response proportionate. Since the brother didn't engage in a private discussion and went public, the author's anger and decision to cut ties might be understandable. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
