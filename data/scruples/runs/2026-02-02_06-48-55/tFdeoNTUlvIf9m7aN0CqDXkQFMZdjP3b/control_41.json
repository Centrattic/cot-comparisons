I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a sibling conflict regarding vaccination. The author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine and her brother is publicizing her as an anti-vaxxer, leading to her cutting him off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author missed the Gardasil vaccine when she was 14 but isn't anti-vax. She decided against getting it now because it's not effective for her anymore, she doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom agreed with her decision but didn't fully explain to her brother. The brother then made a public Facebook post accusing her of being anti-vax. She asked him to take it down, he refused unless she got vaccinated, and she cut him off. The mom thinks she's being too harsh.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The brother is publicizing a false label (anti-vaxxer) without understanding the context. The author's decision is based on medical reasoning. The brother is using his kids as leverage, which might be crossing a line. However, parents often prioritize their children's safety. But the author's decision not to get the vaccine doesn't actually pose a risk to the kids because Gardasil is for prevention, not treatment, and she's not transmitting HPV. The brother's public shaming is probably the bigger issue here. The author's response is cutting off the brother, which could be seen as extreme, but given the public shaming and lack of communication, maybe justified. The mom's side is that she's too harsh, but maybe the brother's actions were worse. So, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
