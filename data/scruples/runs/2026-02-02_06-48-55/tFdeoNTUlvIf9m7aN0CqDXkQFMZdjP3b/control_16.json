I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine and their brother is mad, so they cut him off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the facts. The author didn't get Gardasil when they were 14 because they were scared of needles. Now they're an adult and the doctor mentioned it, but they decided against getting it because they're past the effectiveness window, they don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. Their mom agreed with this decision but didn't explain it fully to the brother, who then made a public post calling the author an anti-vaxxer. The author cut off the brother for that.\n\nSo the question is: is the author wrong for cutting off their brother? \n\nLet me break it down. The author didn't skip all vaccines, just Gardasil. They have a rational reason for not getting it now. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially making a public post. The author felt wronged because they supported the brother and kids a lot. The mom thinks they're being too harsh.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's decision is personal and based on medical reasoning. The brother's public shaming is problematic. The author's response was to cut off the brother, which is a strong move but maybe justified given the public humiliation. The brother didn't engage in dialogue but instead attacked publicly. The author's reasons for cutting off are about self-respect and standing up against public shaming. \n\nBut is cutting off a family member over this extreme? The brother's actions were hurtful, so the author's response might be seen as self-defense. The author isn't anti-vax, so the brother's accusation is false. The public post could harm the author's reputation. So the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's legitimate medical reasoning, the brother's public shaming without understanding, and the author defending their choice. The mom's criticism might be because cutting off family is drastic, but the brother's actions were the catalyst. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they had valid reasons and the brother's behavior was the issue. So the answer would be B.\n"
