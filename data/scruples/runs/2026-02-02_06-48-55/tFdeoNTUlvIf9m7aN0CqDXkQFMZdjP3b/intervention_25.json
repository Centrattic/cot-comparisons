I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for cutting off her brother after he made a public Facebook post accusing her of being an anti-vaxxer when she actually isn't. The main issue here is the brother's public shaming versus the author's decision to cut him off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine because she was 14 when offered and refused, and now she's decided against it since it's less effective for her age and she's not at risk. Her mom agreed but didn't explain fully, leading the brother to make a post. The brother's reasoning is about protecting his kids, but he didn't take the time to understand the situation. The author then stops all contact and support, which the mom thinks is harsh.\n\nThe key points are: Was the author justified in cutting off her brother? Is the brother's public post a reasonable action given his concerns? Also, the author mentions she's not an anti-vaxxer and has been supportive of him and his kids. \n\nPublic shaming in this context could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the brother had concerns, airing them publicly without full understanding might be uncalled for. The author's response is a form of accountability. She's protecting her own reputation and possibly her health by not getting a vaccine she deems unnecessary. \n\nBut is cutting off all contact too harsh? Maybe the brother's intent was protective, but his method was inappropriate. The author decided not to engage anymore because of the public accusation. The mother's opinion is that this is too harsh, which might reflect a family bias. \n\nI should consider the facts. The author hasn't missed vaccines other than Gardasil, which is specific. The brother's post labels her negatively, which could harm her relationships and reputation. The author's response is to stop contact and support, which is a significant step but might be justified if she feels shamed. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the brother's public criticism was unwarranted and not communicated privately first, then the author's reaction could be seen as a reasonable boundary. However, cutting off a sibling is a big move. But given the public shaming and the brother's unwillingness to take it down despite her request, maybe she's justified. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The brother's public post was inappropriate and the author is setting boundaries after being unfairly labeled. The author explained her reasoning to her mom, who agreed, but the brother didn't get the full story. The public accusation is a breach, and the author has every right to be upset. Cutting off contact as a result of being shamed, especially when her actions don't endanger others, seems like a valid response.\n"
