I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a sibling conflict regarding vaccines. The key points here are the sister not getting the Gardasil vaccine and the brother publicizing her as an anti-vaxxer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The sister explains she missed Gardasil but isn't anti-vax. She has reasons based on age, effectiveness, and her husband's vaccination. The brother is concerned about his kids's safety, so he wants her vaccinated before interacting with them. She cuts him off when he posts publicly without understanding her position.\n\nThe brother's public post seems to misrepresent her, not explaining her stance fully. Mom didn't clarify, leading to the conflict. The sister feels betrayed because she supported him before. Now she's cutting ties.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the brother's public shaming might be harsh without full context. The sister had valid medical reasoning. However, the sister's decision to cut off completely might be seen as extreme. But given the brother's public accusation without understanding, her reaction could be justified.\n\nIs the sister wrong? Well, her refusal is personal choice, and she's not anti-vax. The brother's approach was public confrontation without discussion. She had the right to set boundaries after being misrepresented. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
