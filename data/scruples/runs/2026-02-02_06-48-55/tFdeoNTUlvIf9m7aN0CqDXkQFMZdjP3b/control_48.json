I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The sister didn't get the Gardasil vaccine and now her brother is publicizing her as an anti-vaxxer. She cut him off after he made the Facebook post. \n\nThe key points here are the sister's reasoning. She wasn't anti-vax but missed Gardasil because she was 14 and didn't like needles. Now she's decided against it since it's not effective for her anymore, she doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom agreed with her, but the brother didn't get the full story and made a public post. \n\nThe sister was offered the vaccine as a child and declined, but the brother is now using that against her. The sister's reasoning for not getting it now is valid from a medical standpoint. The brother's actions\u2014public shaming and cutting her off\u2014seem harsh, especially since he didn't fully understand her position. The sister's response was cutting off all contact and support, which might be a strong reaction, but the brother's public accusation and refusal to take it down were also problematic. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The brother's public post was inappropriate, and the sister had a valid medical rationale. Even though cutting off a sibling is a big step, the brother's actions were the trigger. The mother's opinion doesn't sway the fact that the brother's public accusation was unjust. So the sister's actions were a justified self-defense of her reputation and choices. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
