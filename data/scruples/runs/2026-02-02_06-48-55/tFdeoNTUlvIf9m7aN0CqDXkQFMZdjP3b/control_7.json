I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a sibling conflict over vaccination status, specifically the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author hasn't had Gardasil, which they decided against at 14 and now feel it's too late because they're past the effective age. Their brother publicly criticized them as an anti-vaxxer and won't let them around his kids unless they get vaccinated. The author cut off their brother, leading to the question of fault.\n\nI need to consider the key points. The author isn't anti-vax; they just missed one vaccine. The brother is concerned about his kids' safety, which is understandable. However, the brother made a public Facebook post without fully understanding the situation, which could be seen as harsh or judgmental. The author's decision to cut off the brother might seem extreme, but they did it after being publicly shamed and refused to take down the post. They also mention supporting the brother and his kids in the past, adding to the conflict.\n\nThe brother's actions might be overreacting, especially since the author isn't a risk for transmitting HPV given her circumstances. The author's response is a reaction to public shaming. While cutting off a sibling is a big step, it's a personal choice based on the brother's refusal to retract the post. It's a matter of boundaries and respect. The mother's opinion that the author is too harsh adds another layer, but the core issue is the brother's public accusation without context.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't do anything harmful by not getting the vaccine, and their response was to protect themselves from public shaming. The brother's actions were problematic by not respecting their decision and making a public accusation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
