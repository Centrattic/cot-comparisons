I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their brother after he publicized that they didn't have the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author didn't get the HPV vaccine because they were 14 and didn't want another shot. Now they're an adult, and the doctor mentioned they're past the effective age for the vaccine. They chose not to get it since they don't have HPV and their husband is vaccinated. Their mom agreed, but the brother didn't get the full context. He made a public Facebook post calling them an anti-vaxxer, which upset the author. The author then decided to cut off contact with the brother. The mom thinks the author is being too harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's decision not to get the vaccine is based on medical reasoning (age, effectiveness, partner's vaccination), but they didn't explain this to their brother. The brother, without understanding the full story, made a public accusation. The author felt attacked and cut off the brother. The question is whether the author was wrong to do so.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They acted on their own medical advice and had a valid reason for not getting the vaccine. The brother's public shaming without understanding the context was inappropriate. The author's decision to stop contact could be seen as a response to public humiliation and disrespect, especially given their history of support. The brother's actions might have been more hurtful, so the author's choice to cut off ties isn't unjustified. So the answer should be B.\n"
