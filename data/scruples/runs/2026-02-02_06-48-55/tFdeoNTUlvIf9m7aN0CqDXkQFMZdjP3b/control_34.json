I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a sibling conflict over vaccination. The author skipped the Gardasil vaccine at 14 and now chooses not to get it because they're out of the effective window, don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. The brother publicly called them an anti-vaxxer, leading the author to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, consider the facts. The author isn't anti-vax; they just missed one vaccine. Gardasil is for HPV, which is primarily transmitted through sexual contact. Since the author is married, presumably sexually active, but doesn't have HPV, the effectiveness of the vaccine now is questionable. The brother's concern is about protecting his kids from potential HPV, but the risk here is minimal given the author's current status and relationship with her husband. \n\nThe brother made a public accusation without understanding the nuances. The author explained their reasoning, but the brother ignored that and posted publicly. The author then cut off the brother, which might seem extreme, but it's in response to public shaming. The mother's side is that the author is being harsh, but the brother's actions seem to be the main issue here. \n\nPublicly shaming a family member over a non-issue, especially when the person isn't a danger to the kids (since HPV isn't spread through casual contact), seems unjust. The brother's post could be seen as hypocritical if he's protecting against a virus that isn't transmitted through everyday interactions. The author's response was self-defense against public humiliation, so B seems right.\n"
