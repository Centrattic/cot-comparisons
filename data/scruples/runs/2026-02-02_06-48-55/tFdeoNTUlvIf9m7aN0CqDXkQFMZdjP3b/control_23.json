I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a family conflict over a vaccine, specifically the Gardasil vaccine. The sister didn't get it when she was 14 because she didn't want a needle, and now she's decided not to get it because she's past the effectiveness window, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her brother publicly called her an \"anti vaxxer\" and refused to let her near his kids unless she gets vaccinated. She cut him off, and now her mom is saying she's too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The sister made a personal medical decision based on her age, current health, and family situation. She's not anti-vax, just missing one vaccine. The brother's public accusation seems harsh and possibly inaccurate, as she's not opposed to vaccines in general. His post might be spreading misinformation by labeling her as anti-vax, which could harm her reputation. \n\nThe sister's response was cutting off the brother, which is a significant step. However, given that the brother publicly shamed her without fully understanding the context, her decision to end the relationship might be justified. Her mom's criticism suggests that there's a middle ground, but the brother's actions were public and damaging, which could make his the wrong in the situation. \n\nI should also consider the dynamics of family support. The sister provided support over the years, so the brother's public shaming without discussion is a breach of trust. The sister's choice to set boundaries might be reasonable here. The brother's insistence on vaccination for his kids is about protecting health, but his public shaming and refusal to engage respectfully might be where he's wrong. The sister isn't violating any obvious health risks to the kids since she's not transmitting HPV. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the brother's actions seem more in the wrong because of the public accusation and lack of understanding. The sister's decision to cut him off is a reaction to his public shaming, which might be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
