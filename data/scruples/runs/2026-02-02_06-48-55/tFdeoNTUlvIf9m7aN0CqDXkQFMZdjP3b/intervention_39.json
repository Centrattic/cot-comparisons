I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for cutting off their brother after he publicly criticized them for not getting the Gardasil vaccine. \n\nFirst, the author explains that they missed the Gardasil shot at 14 but aren't anti-vax. They decided against getting it now because they're past the effective age, don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. Their mom agreed, but the brother took it to Facebook, calling them an anti-vaxxer and refusing contact unless they get vaccinated. The author then cuts off the brother.\n\nSo, the key points are: the brother's public shaming, the author's reasoning, and the subsequent cutoff. The brother's actions seem harsh, especially since the author's stance is informed and they've discussed it with their mom. The brother didn't explain the situation but publicly criticized, which could be seen as violating privacy. The author's response is cutting off support, which might be seen as a justified reaction given the public shaming. However, cutting off family can be heavy. \n\nBut considering the brother's public accusation without understanding the full context, and the author's reasonable explanation, maybe the brother overstepped. The author's decision to cut off ties might be a strong move, but it's a personal choice. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether the brother's actions warranted such a response. Since the brother was inconsiderate and public, the author might be justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
