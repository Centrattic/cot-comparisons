I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about cutting off a brother after he publicly criticized her for not having the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author hasn't had Gardasil, which is an HPV vaccine. She got all other vaccines except this one. She opted out when she was 14 because she didn't want the needle. Now, she's decided against getting it because she's past the effectiveness window, she doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom agreed with her but didn't explain properly to her brother. The brother then made a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer, and the author cut off all contact.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author wrong for cutting off her brother? The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nLet me break this down. The brother's action was making a public post without understanding the full context. The author felt betrayed and decided to end the relationship. The mom thinks she's being too harsh. \n\nI should consider both sides. From the brother's perspective, he's trying to protect his kids. But he didn't know the full story and made a public accusation. That's pretty harsh, especially if it's a misunderstanding. The author had valid reasons for not getting the vaccine. Her decision is personal and based on medical advice. The brother's public shaming crossed a line. \n\nThe author's response was to cut off all contact. That's a strong move, but maybe justified given the public humiliation and lack of communication. The brother didn't even take down the post when asked, which shows he was willing to maintain the accusation. The author's support for her brother and his kids in the past is mentioned, so the betrayal was significant. \n\nIs cutting off a family member over this a wrong action? It depends on the severity of the brother's actions. Public shaming can be a serious issue, especially when it's based on a misunderstanding. The author's decision might be seen as a reaction to protect her reputation and stand up for herself. The brother didn't engage in dialogue but instead chose to publicly shame her. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. However, the brother's action was more directly harmful and disrespectful. The author's response, while extreme, could be seen as a justified reaction to being publicly embarrassed without understanding the facts. The key here is that the brother didn't give her a chance to explain and instead used public shaming, which is a big deal. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She had valid reasons and the brother's actions were the main issue. Cutting off a family member is tough, but given the context, it's understandable.\n"
