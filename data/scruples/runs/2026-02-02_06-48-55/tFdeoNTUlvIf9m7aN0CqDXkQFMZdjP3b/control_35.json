I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for cutting off her brother after he publicly criticized her vaccination status.\n\nFirst, the author missed the Gardasil vaccine as a teenager and decided against getting it later. She's not anti-vax overall, just this specific one. Her reasoning includes being past the effective age, not having HPV, and her husband being vaccinated. She discussed this with her mom, who supported her, but the mom didn't explain it fully to the brother. The brother then made a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer and refusing contact until she gets the shot. The author cut him off, and now she's questioning if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's public shaming and the author's response. Public shaming, especially on social media, can be harmful and is generally considered disrespectful. The brother's actions were likely the main issue here. The author's decision to cut him off might be seen as a self-defense measure after being publicly humiliated and having her personal medical decisions judged without full context.\n\nThe brother's stance on protecting his kids is understandable, but the method he used\u2014public accusation and refusal to engage unless she complies\u2014might be excessive. The author explained her reasoning, which the brother didn't fully grasp, leading to the conflict. Her response, while drastic, could be justified as a response to being shamed and disrespected. The mother's comment that she's being too harsh might not account for the emotional impact of the public post.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's often about the balance of actions. The brother's public post was likely the inciting incident. The author's reaction, while cutting off communication, was a way to set boundaries after feeling attacked. So, considering the context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
