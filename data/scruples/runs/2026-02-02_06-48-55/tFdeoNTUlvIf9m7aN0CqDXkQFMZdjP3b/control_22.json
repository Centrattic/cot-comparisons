I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a sister cutting off her brother because he publicly called her an anti-vaxxer for not having the Gardasil vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister missed the Gardasil vaccine at 14 but isn't anti-vax. She's decided not to get it now because she's past the effective age, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom agreed with her decision but didn't explain it to her brother. The brother, upon finding out, made a public Facebook post about her being anti-vax and refusing to be around his kids unless she gets vaccinated. The sister then cut off all contact, and the mom thinks she's too harsh.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the brother's public shaming and the sister's response. The sister's reasoning for not getting Gardasil seems valid from a medical standpoint. She's not putting his kids at risk because she's not engaging in activities that spread HPV. The brother's public post could be seen as shaming without understanding the full context. The sister cutting off the brother because of this might seem harsh, but given the public humiliation and the brother's insistence, maybe not. \n\nThe mother's opinion that the sister is too harsh might be a red herring. The brother's actions were public and confrontational. The sister's response is cutting off all contact, which is a big step but could be justified if she feels disrespected and shamed. \n\nI need to consider if the sister overstepped. Did she have a right to be upset about the public post? Yes. Her decision to cut off support (sitting, gifts, money) is a personal choice, but given the brother's public shaming without full context, it's a valid reaction. The brother's post was harmful and possibly inaccurate, as she's not anti-vax. So the sister isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
