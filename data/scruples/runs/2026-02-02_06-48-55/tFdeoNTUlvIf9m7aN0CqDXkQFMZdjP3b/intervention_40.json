I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author cutting off their brother after he publicly criticized them for not being fully vaccinated, specifically mentioning the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author didn't get Gardasil because they opted out at 14, then later decided against it since they're past the effectiveness window, don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. Their mom agreed with this decision but didn't explain it to the brother, who then made a public Facebook post calling the author an anti-vaxxer. The author cut off their brother, and now the mom thinks they were too harsh.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The brother's stance is about protecting his kids, which is a valid concern. However, public shaming and not listening to the reasoning might be over the line. The author's decision not to get the vaccine is personal and based on their circumstances. Cutting off a sibling is a big move, but the brother's public post could have been hurtful and not respectful of the author's autonomy.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's public shaming versus the author's decision to cut ties. Publicly calling someone an anti-vaxxer without understanding their situation could be seen as dismissive and harmful. The author's response is a form of self-respect and boundary-setting. While cutting off a brother is serious, if the brother's actions were disrespectful and public, the author might have legitimate reasons to distance themselves.\n\nSo, considering the brother's actions and the author's response, the author might not be in the wrong if the brother was the one being disrespectful. The answer would be B (No).\n"
