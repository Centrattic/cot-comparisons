I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The story is about a sibling conflict over a vaccine. The main points are about the sister not getting the Gardasil vaccine and the brother publicizing her as an anti-vaxxer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key elements. The sister didn't get Gardasil when she was 14 because she didn't want the shot. Now, she's decided not to get it because it's past the effective age, she doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. The brother made a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer and refusing to let her around his kids unless she gets the shot. The sister cut off her brother, and the mom thinks she's too harsh. The question is whether the sister is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the sister's actions: she made a personal health decision based on her doctor's advice. The brother publicized her without context, which could be seen as shaming her and affecting her reputation. The sister cutting off contact is a response to his public shaming. \n\nThe brother's stance is about protecting his kids, but the sister argues that the vaccine isn't necessary in their situation. The brother's public post seems to be the immediate trigger. The sister's response might be seen as cutting off a family member, but if the brother was the one who made the post and refused to take it down, the sister might feel justified in ending the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the context, the sister isn't anti-vax, just missed a specific vaccine. The brother's public accusation is problematic. The sister cutting off contact is a strong move but in response to public shaming. The mother's opinion is that the sister is too harsh, but that might not account for the brother's actions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the sister isn't wrong in her health decision, and the brother's public post was inappropriate. Her cutting off contact is a personal choice, but given the brother's actions, it's a reasonable response. Therefore, the sister is not in the wrong.\n"
