I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their brother after he publicly criticized them for not having the Gardasil vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author didn't get Gardasil when asked at 14 and now, as an adult, has decided not to get it because it's not effective anymore for them. Their mom agreed with their decision but didn't explain properly to the brother. The brother then posted on Facebook calling the author an anti-vaxxer and insisted she get vaccinated to be around his kids. The author cut off the brother, and the mom thinks they're too harsh. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's choice regarding a vaccine, the brother's public shaming, the author's response cutting off the brother, and whether this response is justified.\n\nFirst, the author's vaccine choice. Gardasil is for HPV, which they claim they don't have, and they're past the effectiveness window. Their husband is vaccinated. Their mom supported their decision. So the author isn't anti-vax, just making a personal health choice. The brother didn't understand the context and made a public post. That's where the conflict arises.\n\nThe brother's actions: he's trying to protect his kids, but his method was public shaming without understanding the full story. Publicly calling someone an anti-vaxxer when they're not might be harsh. The author felt disrespected, especially since they've supported him and his kids. The brother's post could damage family relationships and the author's reputation.\n\nThe author's response: cutting off all contact. That's a significant action. The brother didn't take down the post unless she got the shots, which she refused. The author felt justified because of past support, but the mom thinks it's too harsh. \n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The brother's public post was indeed inappropriate, as he didn't explain the context and made a false label. The author's response, while extreme, could be seen as self-defense against public shaming. However, cutting off a family member completely might be seen as overreacting. But given the public nature of the post and the personal history, maybe it's a justified stand to protect their boundaries.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for choosing not to take the vaccine, as it's a personal medical decision. The brother overstepped by publicizing it without context. The author's response is a matter of personal boundaries. While some might say cutting off family is harsh, others would support setting boundaries against public shaming. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
