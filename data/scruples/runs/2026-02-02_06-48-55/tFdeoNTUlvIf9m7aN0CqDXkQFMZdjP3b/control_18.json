I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sibling conflict over vaccination, specifically the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author hasn't had the Gardasil vaccine. She skipped it when she was 14 and now, as an adult, has decided not to get it because she's past the effective age, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. She discussed this with her mom, who agreed, but the mom didn't explain properly to her brother. The brother then publicly shamed her as an \"anti-vaxxer\" on Facebook and refused to let her see his kids unless she gets vaccinated. The author cut off her brother, and now is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's decision not to get Gardasil is based on medical reasoning (age, effectiveness window, low risk), and her brother is making a public accusation that's misleading. She cut off relations over this. \n\nIs she wrong for cutting off her brother? Well, the brother's actions are definitely problematic. Publicly shaming a family member over a medical decision that's not putting others at risk could be seen as harsh. The author's decision to cut off contact might be a strong reaction, but given that the brother wasn't respecting her autonomy and was making false claims, it could be justified. The mom's side is that the brother was trying to protect his kids, but the author isn't in a position to spread HPV since she doesn't have it and isn't engaging in activities that transmit it. So the brother's threat that she can't see his kids unless vaccinated seems unwarranted. \n\nThe author's cut-off is a reaction to public shaming and not allowing her to see the kids, which is a significant issue. The question is whether her reaction is too harsh. Considering the brother's public shaming and the mom's partial blame, the author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as self-respecting. But maybe some would argue that cutting off a sibling is extreme. However, given the context, the author is defending her autonomy against a public attack. So likely, she's not in the wrong.\n"
