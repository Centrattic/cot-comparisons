I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off her brother after he publicly criticized her for not having the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine because she opted out at 14 and now at 25, she's decided it's not necessary for her. Her mom told her brother, but he misunderstood or didn't get the full story. The brother then made a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer and refusing to let her around his kids unless she got the shots. The author cut off her brother, and the mom thinks she's too harsh. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's decision not to get Gardasil, the brother's public accusation, and her cutting him off. \n\nI need to consider the facts. Gardasil is a vaccine against HPV. The author says she's past the effectiveness window, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. So maybe her reasoning is sound. However, the brother is concerned about his kids' safety. But does that justify public shaming? The brother didn't explain her reasoning and just labeled her as anti-vax, which is a serious accusation. \n\nThe author's response was cutting off her brother. Is that justified? She mentions supporting him and his kids in the past. Cutting off all contact because of this public post might be a strong reaction. However, the brother's public post could be seen as violating privacy and using an emotionally charged label. \n\nOn one hand, the brother's action was public shaming, which is not okay. On the other hand, the author's decision to cut off all contact might be seen as extreme. But maybe it's a stand for her own boundaries after being publicly attacked without context. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. I need to weigh whether her decision is too harsh. The brother's post was public, which is more damaging than a private disagreement. The author might feel that her personal medical choices were unfairly attacked without understanding. \n\nAlso, the brother's insistence on vaccination for something that the author argues isn't a risk (since she doesn't have HPV and her husband is vaccinated) might be overreaching. But the brother is trying to protect his kids, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the brother's public post likely crossed a line. The author's cutting off contact is a personal choice, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, if her actions were a response to his public shaming, she might not be in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that cutting off a sibling is extreme. But given the public nature of the post and the accusation, her reaction could be seen as justified. So, maybe the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
