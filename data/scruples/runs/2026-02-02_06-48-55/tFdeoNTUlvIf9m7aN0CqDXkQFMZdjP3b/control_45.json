I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their brother who called them an anti-vaxxer for not getting the Gardasil vaccine. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the author didn't get Gardasil when it was first offered because they were 14 and didn't want a needle. Now they're older and decided against it because it's less effective for them, they don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. They talked to their mom, who agreed, but the brother didn't get the full info and made a public Facebook post.\n\nThe brother's main concern is protecting his kids from the author's unvaccinated status. But the author argues that the vaccine isn't necessary in their case. So, the brother's post might be based on a misunderstanding. The author feels wronged because they've supported him and his kids a lot. They cut off the brother when he refused to take the post down unless they got the vaccine. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Option A is yes, B is no. The key points here are the brother's right to express his concerns and the author's right to make their own health decisions. The brother's post was public and possibly shaming, which could be seen as crossing a line. The author's response was to stop all support, which might be harsh but is a personal boundary. \n\nThe brother's post doesn't just criticize the author; it's about their relationship with his kids, implying they're a danger. The author's refusal to get the vaccine is based on medical reasoning. The brother's insistence on vaccination without understanding the situation might be the main issue here. The author's cut-off is a reaction to public shaming and the brother's lack of willingness to listen. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because setting boundaries after being publicly shamed, especially when the situation is mischaracterized, is understandable. The brother's actions were probably more at fault here. So the answer should be B.\n"
