I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author hasn't had the Gardasil vaccine. They opted out when they were 14 because they didn't want the needle. Now, they're older, and the doctor mentioned the vaccine's effectiveness window has passed for them. They don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. They discussed this with their mom, who agreed, but the brother found out and made a public Facebook post calling them an anti-vaxxer and refusing contact until they get vaccinated. The author cut off their brother, and the mom thinks they're being too harsh. The user is curious if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's reasoning for not getting Gardasil seems reasonable: it's not effective for them anymore, they don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. They also tried to explain their stance to their brother but he didn't listen. The brother's public shaming is a big issue. Publicly calling someone an anti-vaxxer could be a mischaracterization, especially if the author isn't against vaccines in general. The brother's insistence on vaccination for the sake of his kids might be coming from a place of concern, but his method of handling it\u2014public shaming\u2014is questionable.\n\nThe author cut off their brother after being publicly shamed and feeling unsupported. They mention supporting him financially and otherwise. The mom's opinion is that the author is too harsh, but that's a parent's perspective, which can be biased. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The brother's actions might have been more inconsiderate. Publicly humiliating a family member over a personal medical decision could be seen as overstepping. The author had a valid medical rationale and communicated their reasons. The brother's refusal to take down the post unless they comply adds pressure. The author's response was cutting off the brother, which is a significant step but perhaps justified given the public shaming and lack of support.\n\nIn terms of \"wrongdoing,\" the author's choice might be harsh, but the brother's public accusation and ultimatum could also be at fault. The author isn't anti-vax; they just skipped one vaccine for personal and medical reasons. The brother's actions might be more in the wrong because of public shaming without full context. So the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
