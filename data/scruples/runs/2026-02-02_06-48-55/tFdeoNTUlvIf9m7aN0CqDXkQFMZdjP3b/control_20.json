I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a sibling conflict where the sister decides not to get the Gardasil vaccine and her brother publicly calls her an anti-vaxxer, leading her to cut him off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister didn't get Gardasil when she was 14 because she didn't want a needle, and now she's decided against getting it because she's past the age of effectiveness, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. The mom agreed with her, but the brother didn't and made a public Facebook post. The sister cut him off, and the mom thinks she's being too harsh. The question is if the sister is in the wrong.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The brother is concerned about his kids' safety and wants her vaccinated before being around them. The sister argues that the vaccine isn't necessary anymore and that her actions don't pose a risk. The brother's public post seems harsh, especially if he didn't fully understand her reasoning. The sister then cuts him off, which might be a strong reaction.\n\nFrom a medical standpoint, the sister's reasoning about the Gardasil vaccine being less effective now and her personal risk factors might be valid. The brother's public shaming could be seen as crossing a line, especially if he misrepresented her stance as anti-vax when she's not. The sister's decision to cut him off is a personal choice, but whether it's wrong depends on context. If he was being disrespectful and she felt her support was being ignored, her reaction might be justified. However, cutting off a family member is a big step. The mom's opinion that she's being too harsh suggests there might be a middle ground.\n\nBut the brother's public post is problematic because he didn't explain her reasons and called her anti-vax, which she's not. That's a misrepresentation and could be seen as bullying. The sister's response is to stop providing support, which she sees as deserved given his actions. So, in terms of who is in the wrong, the brother's actions might be more egregious, but the sister's response is also extreme. However, the question is about whether the author (the sister) is in the wrong. If the brother's actions were inappropriate, then the sister's response could be justified. But if the brother had a legitimate concern, maybe the sister overreacted.\n\nI think the key here is the brother's public shaming without understanding her reasons. The sister's decision not to get the vaccine is a personal medical choice based on her current situation. The brother's public post is likely the bigger issue. Therefore, the sister is not necessarily in the wrong for cutting him off in response to his public shaming. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
