I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nSo the situation is about a sister who didn't get the Gardasil vaccine when she was 14 because she didn't want another shot. Now, she's decided not to get it because she's out of the effective age range, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom told her brother, who then insisted she get all vaccines before seeing his kids. She refused, he posted on Facebook calling her an anti-vaxxer, and she cut him off. The mom thinks she's harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The sister's reasoning: she missed a vaccine but isn't anti-vax. The brother's concern is about protecting his kids from HPV, which Gardasil prevents. But she argues that the vaccine isn't effective for her now and transmission risk is low. The brother made a public post, which escalated the situation. \n\nThe sister cut off all contact and support. Is that too harsh? Well, the brother's public shaming might have been the trigger. She felt wronged, given her support over the years. The mom's side is also important here\u2014she agreed with the sister's decision but didn't explain it to the brother, leading to misunderstanding.\n\nPublic shaming can be a big deal. If the brother was trying to protect his kids, he might have a point, but his method was extreme. The sister's response was cutting off all contact, which is a significant action. But considering the public post and the lack of explanation, her anger is understandable. \n\nI think the key points are the brother's public accusation without full context and the sister's justified frustration. The brother's actions were hurtful and possibly unnecessary. The sister's decision to cut him off might be a strong response, but given the circumstances, she's not entirely in the wrong. So the answer is B, No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
