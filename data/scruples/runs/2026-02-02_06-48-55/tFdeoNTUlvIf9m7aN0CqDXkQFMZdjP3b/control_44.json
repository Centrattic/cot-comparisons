I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about her brother making a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer because she didn't get the Gardasil vaccine. The author says she didn't get it when she was 14 because she didn't want another shot and now, as an adult, she's decided not to get it because it's not effective anymore, she doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning: she's not anti-vax because she's had all other vaccines. She chose not to get Gardasil at 14, and now, as an adult, she's made an informed decision based on her age and circumstances. Her mom agreed with her, but the brother wasn't fully informed and made a post. The brother's argument is about protecting his kids, so he wants her to be fully vaccinated. The author feels this is unnecessary and that the post was public shaming, leading her to cut him off.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\n1. **Medical Decision**: The author made a personal medical choice. Gardasil is more effective when given before exposure to HPV, which she claims she doesn't have. Her reasoning seems valid. The brother might not understand the nuances, but it's her body and her choice.\n\n2. **Communication**: The mom didn't explain the situation fully to the brother, leading him to misunderstand. He then made a public post without getting the full story. The author's reaction to the post (cutting off) might be a result of feeling shamed publicly. \n\n3. **Public Shaming**: The brother's Facebook post is a public shaming, which can be hurtful and damaging. The author's cutting off the brother because of this could be seen as justified if she felt disrespected and the post was a violation of privacy. \n\n4. **Family Dynamics**: The author mentions she's supported the brother and his kids a lot. Feeling that her efforts were disregarded might add to her frustration. The mom's comment that she's being too harsh could be from a place of trying to keep the family together, but the brother's actions might have crossed a line.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it wrong not to get Gardasil? If someone is in a situation where the vaccine is no longer effective, and they're not at risk of transmitting HPV (e.g., in a monogamous relationship with a vaccinated partner), then it's a personal choice. The brother's insistence might be overreaching, especially if he's not considering her medical reasoning.\n\n6. **Response to the Post**: The author's decision to cut off the brother is a strong action, but if the brother refused to take down the post and the author felt it was a betrayal, then her reaction might be seen as a defense of her boundaries.\n\nPutting it all together, the author made an informed medical decision, the brother acted without full information and publicly shamed her, leading to the author cutting off contact. The brother's actions could be seen as the wrong here, but the author's response is a personal choice. However, whether she's in the wrong depends on whether her decision to cut off the brother was justified. Since the brother was publicizing a personal health choice without understanding, the author might not be in the wrong for standing up for herself, especially if the post was hurtful and the brother wasn't willing to retract it.\n"
