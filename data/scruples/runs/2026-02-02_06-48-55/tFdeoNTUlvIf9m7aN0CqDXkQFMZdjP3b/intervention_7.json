I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off her brother after he publicly criticized her vaccination status. \n\nFirst, the author hasn't had the Gardasil vaccine, which is against HPV. She opted out at 14 and now, as an adult, has decided not to get it because she's beyond the effectiveness window, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom agreed with her decision but didn't explain it fully to her brother. \n\nThe brother then made a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer, which she found out about and confronted. He refused to remove the post unless she got vaccinated. She cut off all contact, leading to the question of whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: the brother's public shaming and ultimatum, the author's reasons for not getting the vaccine, and her response. \n\nThe brother's public post is problematic because he didn't fully understand her situation. He made an ultimatum and publicly criticized her, which is hurtful. The author felt wronged because she's made efforts to support him and his kids. Cutting off contact is a strong move, but maybe justified given the public shaming and lack of respectful communication. \n\nThe mom's side is that the author is being too harsh, but the brother's actions were more aggressive. The author's reasons for not getting the vaccine are legitimate medical considerations. So, the brother's actions seem more in the wrong, but does the author overreact? Maybe not. She set boundaries after being publicly humiliated. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the brother's actions were the main issue. The author had valid reasons and was standing up for herself.\n"
