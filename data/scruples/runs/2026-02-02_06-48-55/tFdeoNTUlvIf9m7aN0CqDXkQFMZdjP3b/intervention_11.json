I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their brother after he publicly criticized them for not having the Gardasil vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author missed the Gardasil vaccine at 14 due to personal choice, later decided against getting it because it's not effective anymore for them, they don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. They told their mom, who agreed, but the brother found out and made a public Facebook post calling the author an anti-vaxxer and refusing to let the author near his kids unless she got the shots. The author then cut off the brother and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for not getting the vaccine, the brother's public shaming, and the author's response. \n\nI think the brother's actions might be problematic. Publicly shaming someone on Facebook without fully understanding the context could be seen as harsh and potentially damaging. The author didn't refuse all vaccines, just one, and had a valid medical reason (age window). The brother's post might be spreading misinformation by labeling the author as an anti-vaxxer, which isn't accurate here. \n\nThen, the author's response was cutting off their brother. They mention they've supported him a lot in the past. Cutting off contact is a big step, but maybe justified if the brother was being disrespectful. However, some might argue that cutting off family isn't the best approach, especially if there's a chance for reconciliation. The mom's opinion that the author was too harsh adds another layer.\n\nBut the brother's public post was a violation of privacy and spread of untruths. The author had a right to be upset. The brother's insistence on vaccination for non-risky contact might be overreaching. So, the author's decision to cut off the brother could be seen as a justified response to protect their reputation and set boundaries. \n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't give the brother a chance to retract the post privately first? The author did ask to take it down, and the brother refused, so maybe that's a valid trigger. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, it's a balance between standing up for oneself and maintaining family relationships. The author's reasons for not taking the vaccine are legitimate, and the brother's actions were public and hurtful. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for cutting off a family member who publically shamed them. So, answer B (No).\n"
