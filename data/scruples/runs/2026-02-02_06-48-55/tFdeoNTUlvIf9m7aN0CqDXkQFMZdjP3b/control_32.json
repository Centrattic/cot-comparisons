I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person cutting off their brother because he publicly called them an anti-vaxxer for not getting the Gardasil vaccine. The key points here are the reasons behind not getting the vaccine, the brother's reaction, and the consequences of cutting off the brother.\n\nFirst, the author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine when they were 14 because they didn't want another shot. They didn't realize they missed it until recently. Now, they've decided not to get it because they're past the effective age, don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. They discussed this with their mom, who agreed, but the brother found out and made a public Facebook post about the sister being an anti-vaxxer and refusing to be around his kids. The author then cut off the brother, leading to the AITA question.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's decision not to get the vaccine now is based on medical reasoning: age, no current HPV, and the husband's vaccination. They also mention that their mom supported them. The brother, however, misunderstood the situation and made a public accusation. The author felt disrespected and cut off the brother. \n\nPublicly shaming family over a medical decision is a big deal. The brother's post seems to spread misinformation by labeling the sister as an anti-vaxxer when she's not against vaccines in general, just this specific one. The author's response is cutting off contact, which can be seen as extreme, but considering the public shaming and lack of support from the brother, maybe justified. \n\nThe mom's reaction adds another layer. She agreed with the author's medical decision but didn't explain it to the brother, leading to the conflict. The brother's actions were public and judgmental, which can strain family relationships. The author felt unsupported and decided to stop all interactions. \n\nIs cutting off family over this too harsh? It's a personal choice, but given the brother's public post and the author's valid reasoning, maybe not. The brother's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's response is a boundary to protect their own feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The brother's public shaming is the main issue here. The author's decision to cut off the brother could be seen as a reaction to being publicly shamed and disrespected. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
