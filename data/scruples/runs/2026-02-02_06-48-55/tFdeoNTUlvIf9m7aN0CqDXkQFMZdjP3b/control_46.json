I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a sister cutting off her brother after he publicly criticized her for not having the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister didn't get Gardasil when she was 14 because she didn't want a needle. Now, as an adult, she's decided not to get it because she's past the effectiveness window, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. The brother, upon finding out, made a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer and threatening to keep her away from his kids. She cut him off, and the mom thinks she's being too harsh.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The main factors here are her decision not to get the vaccine and her reaction to the brother's public post.\n\nGardasil is for HPV, which is mainly effective if given before exposure. The sister's reasoning seems valid\u2014she's past the window, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. So her stance might be reasonable. The brother's public shaming is a significant issue. He didn't fully understand her reasoning and chose to humiliate her publicly. That's a breach of privacy and respect, which is a big no-no in most social norms.\n\nHer response was to cut off contact, which is extreme but might be justified if she felt disrespected and the brother was unapologetic. However, the mom's reaction suggests there's a family dynamic where maybe the sister's actions are seen as too harsh. But considering the brother's public shaming, the sister's decision to set boundaries could be seen as self-respect.\n\nPotential counterpoints: maybe the brother was just concerned about his kids' health, even if his approach was wrong. But the sister didn't pose a risk, so his actions were based on misinformation. Her cutting him off might be harsh, but it's a personal choice, and she's within her rights to set boundaries. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the brother's actions were definitely wrong. The sister's decision to end the relationship is a personal choice, but given the brother's public shaming and refusal to take it down, her reaction might be understandable. So, the answer would likely be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
