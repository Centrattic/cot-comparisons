I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off her brother over the Gardasil vaccine issue.\n\nFirst, the author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine because she was 14 when it was offered and refused, and now she's decided against getting it since the effectiveness window has passed. She's married to a vaccinated husband, and she doesn't have HPV. She talked to her mom, who agreed with her, but the brother took her unvaccinated status as anti-vax and made a public post. She cut off the brother, leading to the question of fault.\n\nThe brother made a public accusation without understanding the full context. The author's decision was based on medical reasoning, not anti-vax sentiment. The brother's public shaming and refusal to remove the post seems harsh. The author's cutoff was a response to being publicly shamed and feeling disrespected, especially after supporting him and his kids. \n\nThe mom's advice to be less harsh might be coming from a place of wanting family unity, but the brother's actions were invasive and disrespectful. The author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as justified given the public humiliation and lack of communication from the brother. So, the brother's actions were more in the wrong here, making the author not at fault.\n"
