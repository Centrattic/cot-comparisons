I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict over a vaccine, specifically the Gardasil vaccine. The author didn't get it when they were 14 and now, as an adult, has decided not to get it because they believe it's no longer effective for them, they don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. Their brother publicly criticized them as an anti-vaxxer, leading the author to cut off their brother.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author made a personal medical decision. The brother is concerned about his children's safety, which is understandable. However, the brother made a public Facebook post, which is a harsh reaction. The author's response was to cut off contact and support, which their mom thinks is too harsh.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. To decide, I should consider the reasons for the author's decision. They have valid medical reasoning, and their choice is their right as an adult. The brother's public shaming could be seen as overreaching and hurting their relationship. The author's decision to cut off might be a reasonable response to public humiliation, especially after they tried to resolve it privately.\n\nHowever, cutting off family can have emotional consequences. But given the public nature of the brother's post and the author's prior support, the author might feel justified. The key is whether the author's actions were disproportionate. Public shaming is a strong action, and the author's response, while harsh, might be a defense of their autonomy and dignity.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), as the brother's public post was the catalyst, and the author's decision is based on personal medical reasoning.\n"
