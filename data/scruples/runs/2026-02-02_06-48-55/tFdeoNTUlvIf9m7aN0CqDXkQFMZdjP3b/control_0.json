I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves a family conflict over vaccination, specifically the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author didn't get Gardasil because they were 14 and didn't want the shot. Now, they're older and decided not to get it since the effectiveness window has passed, they don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. They discussed this with their mom, who agreed, but the brother found out and made a public Facebook post calling them an anti-vaxxer. The author cut off the brother in response, and the mom thinks they're too harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's public shaming and the author's decision to cut him off. The author's reasoning for not getting the vaccine seems reasonable based on medical advice. The brother's action of making a public post without understanding the full context is problematic. Publicly shaming a family member over a medical decision, especially when the person has valid reasons and is not a risk to his kids, might be seen as overreaching. The author's response, while harsh, could be a reaction to public humiliation. However, cutting off a family member abruptly might have consequences, but given the brother's public post, the author might feel justified. The mom's side is that the author is being too harsh, but the brother's actions were inappropriate. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the brother's public post was an overreaction and the author had legitimate reasons for their stance. The brother's public shaming was the main issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
