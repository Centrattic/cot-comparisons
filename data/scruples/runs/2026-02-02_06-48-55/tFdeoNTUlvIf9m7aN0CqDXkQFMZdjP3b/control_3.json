I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for cutting off their brother because he publicly criticized her for not having the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine when they were 14 because they didn't want a needle, and now they're an adult deciding not to get it because they're past the effectiveness window, don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. Their mom told the brother, who then pressured them to get the vaccine before being around his kids. When the author refused, he posted publicly about her being an \"anti vaxxer,\" leading the author to cut him off. The mom thinks she's being too harsh, but the author feels wronged.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The brother's main issue is about protecting his kids from HPV. Gardasil helps prevent HPV, which can lead to certain cancers. However, the author argues that they aren't doing anything that would spread HPV, so the vaccine isn't necessary now. But the brother is concerned regardless. However, the brother's response was to public shaming, which is pretty harsh. Publicly calling someone an \"anti vaxxer\" when they aren't (since the author has other vaccines) is misleading and maybe unfair.\n\nThe author's decision to cut off the brother could be seen as a reaction to public shaming and not respecting their personal medical decisions. The brother's public post might have been hurtful and not a good way to handle the disagreement. On the other hand, the author could argue that the brother's post was damaging and that cutting off a relationship is a strong step but justified if the brother was being unreasonable.\n\nBut the key points here are consent in medical decisions and how the brother handled the situation. The author made an informed choice not to get the vaccine, and the brother's response was public criticism. The author's decision to stop all contact might be seen as extreme, but it's also a response to public shaming. The line here is whether the brother's actions were justified or if the author overreacted. Since the brother chose to shame her publicly, which is a form of social bullying, the author might have the right to set boundaries. However, cutting off a sibling entirely is a huge step. But considering the public post and the brother's refusal to take it down despite the author's request, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the brother's approach was to make a public accusation, which could harm the author's reputation. The author has a right to protect their own image and set limits when someone is being disrespectful. The brother's actions might have been more in the wrong than the author's response. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
