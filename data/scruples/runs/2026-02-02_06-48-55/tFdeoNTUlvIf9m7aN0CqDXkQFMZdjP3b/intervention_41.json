I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about cutting off their brother for publicly calling them an anti-vaxxer over not getting the Gardasil vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author didn't get Gardasil when they were 14, not because of anti-vaxxer beliefs, but because they didn't want a shot at the time. They later realized they missed it but decided not to get it now. Their mom agreed, but their brother, after being informed, made a public Facebook post about the author being an anti-vaxxer and refused to let them interact with his kids unless they got vaccinated. The author then cut off the brother.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The brother's concern is about protecting his kids from HPV through vaccination. Gardasil is recommended to prevent HPV, which can lead to certain cancers. However, the author argues that the vaccine isn't effective for them anymore since they're past the optimal age. They also mention they don't have HPV and their husband is vaccinated, so transmission risk is low. The brother's public shaming might have been harsh, but his intent was to protect his kids.\n\nThe author's reaction was cutting off their brother, which is a significant step. They mention they've supported him a lot. The brother's public post could be seen as shaming, but the author's decision to cut him off is a personal choice. Legally, the author isn't breaking any laws, and the brother's stance is based on personal health beliefs. Ethically, it's a matter of respect and communication. The brother didn't explain the situation fully before posting, which could be part of the issue. The author's response, while extreme, is a reaction to public shaming and potential damage to their reputation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the brother's approach was inappropriate for public shaming and not respecting the author's decision after a private discussion. The author's response might be seen as justified if they felt their reputation was attacked. However, cutting off family is a big step. It's possible both have valid points, but the brother's public post was more harmful. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves after being publicly shamed without full context.\n"
