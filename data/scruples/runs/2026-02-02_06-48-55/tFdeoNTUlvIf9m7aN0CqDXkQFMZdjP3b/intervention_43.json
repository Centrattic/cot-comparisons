I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The story is about a sister who didn't get the Gardasil vaccine and her brother publicly called her an anti-vaxxer after she refused to get it now. She ended up cutting off her brother because he wouldn't take down the post unless she got vaccinated.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasoning for not getting the vaccine: she skipped it at 14 because she didn't want a needle, later realized she missed it, and decided against it now because she's past the effective age, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom agreed, but her brother took issue and made a public post. She cut off her brother as a result.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The brother made a public accusation without full context, which could be seen as shaming. The sister felt betrayed and decided to cut him off. The mom thought she was being too harsh. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down. \n\nThe brother's actions: Publicly labeling someone as an anti-vaxxer might be harmful, especially if it's not accurate. The sister isn't anti-vax; she just missed one vaccine for personal reasons. His public post could damage her reputation and relationships. That seems harsh, even if he's concerned about his kids.\n\nThe sister's response: Cutting off a brother over this. She mentions supporting him a lot in the past. Ending all contact might be extreme, but if his actions were shaming and he refused to take it down despite her request, maybe she felt justified. \n\nThe brother's stance might be about protecting his kids, which is a valid concern, but the approach was confrontational and public. The sister's decision to stop contact could be a reaction to being publicly shamed and not respected. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the brother's public post is problematic because it's a personal medical choice and was done without full context. The sister cutting him off is a strong reaction, but it's her choice how to handle the relationship. However, cutting off all contact might be seen as overly harsh unless there were other factors. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The sister could have set boundaries without cutting off all contact, or the brother could have approached the situation more privately and respectfully. Since he refused to take down the post despite her request, maybe the sister felt she had no other option. \n\nConsidering intent and impact: The brother's intent was to protect his kids, but the impact was public shaming. The sister's intent was to stand her ground, impact being loss of relationship. \n\nI think the brother is more in the wrong here for the public post, but the sister's reaction is also extreme. However, the question is whether the author (sister) is in the wrong. If she felt her boundaries were crossed and he refused to respect her, then maybe not. But cutting off all contact because of a Facebook post might be seen as harsh. \n\nAlternatively, in some views, if someone is shamed publicly and then cut off, it's a valid self-defense. It's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. But based on the info given, the sister isn't anti-vax, so the brother's labeling was incorrect. The sister's cutting off is a reaction to that. I'm leaning towards the answer being B (not in the wrong) because the brother's actions were the initial wrong.\n"
