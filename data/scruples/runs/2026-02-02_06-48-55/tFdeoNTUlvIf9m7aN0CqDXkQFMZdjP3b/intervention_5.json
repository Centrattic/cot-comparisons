I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sibling conflict over a missed vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine. They mentioned they opted out at 14 and now don't plan to get it because they're past the effectiveness window, don't have HPV, and their husband is vaccinated. Their brother publicized them as an anti-vaxxer on Facebook, leading the author to cut off contact.\n\nThe author's brother is concerned about his kids' safety, which is understandable. But the brother made a public post without fully explaining the context. The author then cut off all contact, which might be seen as a strong reaction.\n\nThe author's reasoning for cutting off the brother includes the brother's public shaming and the brother's refusal to remove the post. The author felt supported by their mom initially but the mom later thought they were too harsh.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The brother's approach was public shaming, which is often considered harsh and not the best way to handle disagreements. The author, on the other hand, decided to cut off all contact, which is a significant consequence. However, the author had tried to reason with the brother first and was rejected. The brother's public post might have been an overreaction as well, especially since the author isn't anti-vax but missed one vaccine. The brother's post could have stigmatized the author unnecessarily.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, cutting off a sibling is a big step, but if the brother was publicizing a personal health choice without understanding the full context, maybe the author's reaction is justified. However, completely cutting off contact might be seen as extreme. But given the public shaming and the brother's refusal to remove the post, the author might feel justified. So it's a bit of a toss-up.\n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me check again. The brother's post was public and hurtful, but the author decided to cut off all contact. If the author had tried other ways to resolve it, maybe. But given the circumstances, maybe the author is justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
