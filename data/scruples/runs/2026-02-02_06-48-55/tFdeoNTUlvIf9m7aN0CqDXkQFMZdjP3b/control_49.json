I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author has a brother who publicly criticized her for not having the Gardasil vaccine, calling her an anti-vaxxer. She explains that she did have all other vaccines but opted out of Gardasil at 14 because she didn't want the needle. Now, she's older and decided not to get it because she's outside the effective age range, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. Her mom agreed with her decision, but the brother didn't get the full context and posted on Facebook about her being anti-vax. She cut off her brother, and the mom thinks she's being too harsh.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off her brother. Let's break down the key points.\n\n1. **Vaccine Decision**: The author made an informed decision after consulting with her doctor. She has a valid medical reason for not getting Gardasil now. This isn't anti-vax; she just missed a vaccine that's less necessary now given her circumstances.\n\n2. **Brother's Reaction**: The brother made a public Facebook post without understanding the full story. His stance is about protecting his kids, but he didn't know the nuances. Publicly labeling someone as anti-vax can be damaging and might be seen as an overreaction if he didn't fully grasp the situation.\n\n3. **Communication Breakdown**: The mom didn't explain the full context to the brother, leading to misinformation. The brother's post was based on incomplete information, which is a problem. The author tried to address it by asking him to take it down, but he refused unless she got vaccinated, which she felt was unfair.\n\n4. **Author's Response**: She cut off contact, which is a significant move. But she felt wronged because the brother's public shaming was unwarranted and hurtful. She also mentions supporting him financially and through babysitting, which adds context about her prior support.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Cutting off a family member is a big step, but it's a personal choice. If the brother violated her privacy or acted in a way that's harmful, the author's response might be justified. However, the brother's intent was to protect his kids, which is understandable.\n\n6. **Public vs. Private Criticism**: The brother's public post could be seen as more harmful than a private discussion. Public shaming can damage relationships and reputations. The author might feel that this public call-out was more about showing off his own choices rather than genuinely worrying about her.\n\n7. **Medical Validity**: The author's decision is medically sound. Gardasil is recommended for certain age groups, and she's no longer in that window. Her rationale about not transmitting HPV because she doesn't have it and her husband is vaccinated also makes sense. The brother's stance might not be fully informed.\n\n8. **Family Dynamics**: The mother's role in not explaining the situation to the brother could be a factor. If the brother was misinformed by their mom, then the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. However, the brother's refusal to listen to the author's explanation is his fault.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the brother's actions might be more in the wrong for the public post without full information. The author's decision to cut him off is a reaction to that. But was cutting off contact justified? It's a personal choice, and depending on the context, it might be seen as reasonable. The author felt her actions were a proportionate response to his public shaming, especially after she tried to resolve it privately.\n\nHowever, some might argue that cutting off a sibling is extreme. But given that the brother refused to take down the post and the mother supported him, the author might feel it's necessary to set boundaries. The key here is whether the brother's actions were unjustified, and the author's response is a defense of her autonomy and privacy.\n\nSo weighing all these factors, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She made a reasoned decision based on her medical advice, and the brother's public post was an overreaction. Her cutting off the brother is a boundary she set in response to his actions.\n"
