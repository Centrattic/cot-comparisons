I've had all my vaccines except gardasil, which I opted out of when the doctor asked at 14 (because I was 14 and didn't want to be stuck with a needle). I didn't realize I was missing the vaccine until my doctor brought it up recently. I've decided not to get it now that I'm older because I'm basically out of the window of effectiveness, I know I don't have HPV, and my husband has been vaccinated.\n\nI discussed this with my mom and she agreed with me. I guess she told my brother about it and didn't explain it fully, because he texted me and insisted I be fully vaccinated before I come around his kids. I basically told him that gardasil won't make any difference in my relationship with his kids because I'm not doing anything with them that would spread HPV even if I had it. He decided after this to make a public facebook post about his \"anti vaxxer sister\" and how noble he is by protecting his children from me. \n\nI asked him to take it down but he refused unless I got the shots. I got pissed because I have done so much to support him and his kids over the last few years. I told him I'm done with him. No more baby sitting, no more gifts, no money lending, nothing. My mom told me I'm being too harsh. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author didn't get the Gardasil vaccine at 14 because she didn't want a needle and later decided not to get it now because she's past the effective age, doesn't have HPV, and her husband is vaccinated. She discussed this with her mom, who agreed. The brother found out through the mom, who didn't explain fully, and then the brother made a public Facebook post calling her an anti-vaxxer and refusing contact unless she gets vaccinated. The author cut him off, and her mom thinks she's being too harsh.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The brother's main concern is about his kids' safety, which is valid. However, he made a public post without understanding her reasoning, which might have been a harsh overreaction. The author's decision not to get the vaccine is based on medical reasoning, and she's taking other precautions (husband vaccinated, no sexual contact with the kids). The brother's public shaming could be seen as violating privacy and not giving her a chance to explain. The author cutting off the brother might be a strong move, but if the brother is being inconsiderate and not listening, maybe it's justified. The mom's side is also a factor here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She didn't do anything illegal, and her decision is based on personal health reasons. The brother's actions were more public and potentially hurtful. The author's response was cutting off contact, which is a personal choice but could be seen as harsh. However, given the brother's public shaming without understanding, maybe she's justified. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to check if her decision to cut off was overly harsh. The brother's post was public and personal, which is a big deal. The author's support for him in the past adds context. The mother's disapproval might be a red herring. Overall, the brother's actions are more problematic, and the author's response, while cutting off, is a reaction to being publicly shamed. So I think the answer is B.\n"
