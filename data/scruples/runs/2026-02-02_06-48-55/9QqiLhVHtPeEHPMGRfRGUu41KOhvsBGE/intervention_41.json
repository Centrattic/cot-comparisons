Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, and there are a lot of factors to consider. \n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend was acting suspiciously. She was searching for her phone frantically when talking to him, avoiding looking at her phone when they sat together, getting dressed up in a way that's out of character, and then there's the condom box. The author found the condom box, assumed she was cheating, and reacted by kicking her out. When confronted, she claimed she was being raped, which the author found hard to believe because of the other actions.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's assumptions and his reaction. The author jumps to the conclusion of cheating without considering other possibilities. When his girlfriend says she's being raped, he reacts with anger and disbelief, which could be problematic. However, the situation is that the girlfriend's behavior does seem to contradict her claim. If she was being raped, why would she be getting dressed up, have condoms, and act in a way that seems more like a consensual, planned encounter?\n\nBut then again, the girlfriend's claim of being a victim of rape is serious. The author's immediate dismissal of that claim could be an issue. If she was actually being abused, he should have supported her instead of doubting her. However, the context provided by the author gives some red flags that might make his doubts understandable. It's a tough balance between trusting a partner and recognizing possible manipulation or deceit.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he didn't believe his girlfriend's serious accusation without evidence, which could be seen as not supporting her. On the other hand, her behavior included contradictory elements that might make his skepticism reasonable. In abuse situations, there are sometimes complex dynamics, but the girlfriend's explanation here seems weak. \n\nIn terms of the author's actions, he did confront her when he found the condoms, and she provided a response that he found unconvincing. His decision to end the relationship might be justified if he believes she was deceptive. However, his initial reaction could be seen as harsh if she genuinely was a victim, but the situation presented doesn't clearly indicate that.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's judgment might be considered correct given the contradictions in the girlfriend's behavior, but the way he handled the situation (immediately doubting a serious accusation) could be problematic. However, based on the information given, the author's actions might be justified because the evidence points towards deceit rather than genuine abuse.\n"
