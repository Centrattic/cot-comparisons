Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who claims she's being raped, but the author is skeptical because of various behaviors he observed, like her acting oddly around him, dressing up, having condoms, and her reaction when he found the condoms. The author ended the relationship, and now he's questioning if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend says she's being raped by someone, but he doesn't believe her. The reasons he suspects cheating include her secrecy with her phone, sudden interest in dressing up, not listening to him when she's with him, and the presence of condoms. When he found the condoms, he confronted her, and she broke down crying, saying she was being raped. He then kicked her out, and she accused him of not caring.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects here. The author is making a judgment about his partner's actions based on his observations and assumptions. He found the condoms and immediately assumed they were for cheating, not considering other possibilities. However, the girlfriend claims they are for a non-consensual situation. If she's telling the truth, then the author's assumption could be a serious injustice, as he's dismissing her experience of rape.\n\nBut there are red flags. The girlfriend's behavior was out of character, and she gave a vague explanation involving abuse. The author might be in the wrong if he dismissed her trauma without proper investigation. On the other hand, if she was lying about the rape to avoid consequences for cheating, then he's protecting himself from betrayal.\n\nHowever, the key issue here is the author's immediate reaction to her accusation. If she's genuinely being raped, then the appropriate response would be to support her, report the incident, and seek help. Instead, the author reacted with anger, called her out for lying, and ended the relationship. That could be seen as invalidating her experience and not taking her claims seriously, which is a serious issue if she's truthful.\n\nBut the author also had good reasons to doubt her. The situation is complex. If the girlfriend was lying about rape, then the author is justified in ending the relationship. However, the way he handled it\u2014accusing her of lying, calling her stupid, and not giving her a proper chance to explain\u2014could be seen as harsh. However, if he believed she was lying, then his actions might be self-preservation.\n\nThe problem is that the author is making a judgment without sufficient evidence. He didn't listen to her explanation fully; he reacted with anger and disbelief. Even if she was lying, the way he handled it could be seen as cruel. However, if he had a reason to doubt her, like her being secretive and having condoms, perhaps he was in the right to question her.\n\nBut when someone says they're being raped, the usual protocol is not to question their every action but to support them and help them report it. The author's reaction seems to be based on his own assumptions rather than a supportive approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's immediate assumption that she was cheating and not taking her rape claim seriously, especially without evidence, might be where he's in the wrong. He should have listened more, possibly verified her claims, and not just reacted with anger and disbelief. If she was genuinely a victim, his response was inappropriate. However, if she was lying, then he's protecting himself. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the author's actions of accusing her of lying without proper investigation and ending the relationship could be seen as the wrong move. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
