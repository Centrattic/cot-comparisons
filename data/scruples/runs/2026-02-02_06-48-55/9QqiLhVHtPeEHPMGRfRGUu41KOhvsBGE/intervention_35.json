Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then confronting her, leading to her claiming she was being raped. The author then breaks up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed several red flags, like her acting suspiciously when searching for her phone, dressing up in an unusual way, and tilting her phone away. Then finding the condoms led him to confront her. She responds by saying she's being raped, which is a serious accusation. The author reacts by breaking up, thinking she's lying because the situation doesn't make sense to him\u2014why would she dress up and have condoms if it's non-consensual?\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: Did the author handle the situation appropriately? Was he justified in his reaction? \n\nOn one hand, the author found what he perceived as evidence of infidelity. His suspicion led him to invade her privacy (checking her purse), which is a problem. Invasion of privacy is generally not acceptable and can be a breach of trust. Then, his reaction of breaking up without giving her a chance to fully explain her side might be hasty. Even if he suspected she was lying, the appropriate step might be to have a calm conversation instead of immediate confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious allegation. The author's skepticism might be valid if there's a lack of evidence supporting her claim. However, the way he approached the situation\u2014confronting her with the condoms and not believing her\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her potential trauma. If she was truly being raped, his reaction could be causing her further harm. But if she lied, his reaction might be justified in terms of protecting himself from betrayal.\n\nThe challenge here is balancing the right to privacy versus the right to know the truth. The author's actions involved invading her privacy, which is ethically wrong. Even if his suspicions were correct, the method he used to uncover them was problematic. Additionally, his immediate reaction of breaking up without allowing her to explain properly could be seen as impulsive. However, if her story doesn't make sense (like using condoms during a rape), his skepticism is understandable.\n\nBut the bigger issue is the invasion of privacy. He had no right to go through her purse. That action alone is a breach of trust and likely contributed to the conflict. Even if he felt justified, it's not an ethical way to handle the situation. Furthermore, the way he reacted\u2014grabbing the box and storming to the bathroom\u2014might have been confrontational and not the best way to approach a sensitive issue.\n\nIn terms of the girlfriend's side, if she was lying, then she's the one in the wrong. But if she was telling the truth, the author's actions are harmful. However, the question is about the author's fault, not hers. Since the author used an unethical method to uncover the issue and reacted impulsively, he is likely in the wrong. However, the situation is complex, and there's a chance he could be right if she was lying. But from an ethical standpoint, his actions (privacy invasion and abrupt breakup) are problematic regardless of the truth.\n"
