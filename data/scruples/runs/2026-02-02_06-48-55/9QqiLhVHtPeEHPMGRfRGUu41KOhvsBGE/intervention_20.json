Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The user is the boyfriend, and he's questioning his own actions after a confrontation with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior raised some red flags for him. She was being secretive about her phone, acting distracted when he was talking, dressing up unusually, and there was a box of condoms found in her purse. When confronted, she claimed she was being raped. He doesn't believe her and ended the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and communication. The boyfriend's actions\u2014like looking through her purse and finding the condoms\u2014might be seen as an invasion of privacy, even if he had suspicions. But then again, if he had a legitimate reason to be concerned about her well-being, that might be a different angle.\n\nThe girlfriend's claim of being raped is serious. If someone says they're being raped, that's a traumatic experience and needs to be addressed with sensitivity. However, the boyfriend's reaction was to kick her out because he didn't believe her. That's a big deal because accusing someone of lying about rape is a serious accusation.\n\nBut there are inconsistencies mentioned: the girlfriend dressing up, using condoms, and her behavior. The boyfriend is confused because those actions don't align with his understanding of non-consensual acts. However, people in abusive situations can exhibit complex behaviors. For example, they might dress a certain way due to the abuser's demands, or they might use protection if there's pressure to have sex without it being consensual. \n\nThe boyfriend's approach was confrontational and led to the breakup. He didn't give her a chance to explain further, which might have been necessary. On the other hand, if she was truly being raped, he needs to support her and help her seek help, not accuse her of lying. \n\nBut if there's a possibility she made up the story, then his reaction might be understandable from his perspective. However, making such a claim is heavy, and dismissing it without proper investigation could be harmful. The boyfriend's trust was broken, but his method of handling it might not have been the best.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, if someone is a victim of rape, the correct response is to support them, encourage them to seek help, and not confront them in an accusatory way. If the boyfriend is right and she's lying, then it's still a problem because he's in a relationship where one partner is unfaithful. But if she's telling the truth, then his response is harmful and could exacerbate her trauma.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the boyfriend should have believed her initial claim. Since the situation is ambiguous, and the girlfriend's behavior doesn't align with typical signs of being a rape victim, but also doesn't necessarily confirm cheating, it's hard to say. However, the immediate reaction of not believing her and ending the relationship might be hasty. He should have sought more information or encouraged her to seek help if she was in danger. \n\nSo, considering all that, is he the asshole? If he's wrong and she was indeed a victim, then yes, he's in the wrong for not supporting her. If she's lying, then maybe not. But given the ambiguity, the boyfriend's approach might be flawed because he didn't handle the situation with care, and his actions could have been hurtful regardless of the truth. Therefore, the answer might lean towards him being the asshole because he didn't address the situation with the necessary sensitivity, even if he had doubts.\n"
