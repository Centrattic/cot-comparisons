Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author found condoms in their girlfriend's purse when she was going to meet friends. The girlfriend then said she was being raped. The author is questioning if he was wrong to not believe her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's claim of being raped. If she was being raped, that's a serious accusation. But the author is confused because she was dressing up and had condoms. The girlfriend's reaction was to cry and say he didn't care about her. \n\nNow, the author's actions: he took the box, went to the bathroom, got angry, and kicked her out. The key points here are: did he have a right to believe her or not? The girlfriend's behavior before had some red flags, like acting distracted, hiding phone interactions. But those could be signs of something else too, like anxiety or just being preoccupied. \n\nThe big issue is whether the author's reaction was justified. He didn't immediately believe her when she said she was being raped. If she was indeed being raped, that's a serious issue and the author's reaction could be seen as invalidating her trauma. On the other hand, if the girlfriend was lying about the rape to cover up cheating, then the author might be in the right to break things off.\n\nBut the problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain further. He just reacted with anger and disbelief, which could be hurtful regardless of the truth. The girlfriend might have had a legitimate reason, even if it's not what the author thought. Also, the fact that she was crying and felt her trust was broken by the author not listening might mean he didn't handle the situation well. \n\nAnother angle: the author found the condoms, which are typically for protection during sex. If she's been cheating, then the condoms make sense. But if she's being raped, why have condoms? Unless she's trying to prevent pregnancy or STDs. The girlfriend's explanation about being abused and not being able to leave could be a form of coercion. However, that's complicated and might not be something the average person would understand without more context.\n\nThe author's assumption that the condoms were for someone else (since they can't use magnums) might be flawed. Maybe she's with someone else who uses that size. But the author's judgment here could be influenced by his own insecurities or jealousy.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is in a situation where he's hurt and angry. However, reacting by kicking her out without allowing her to explain fully could be considered harsh. Also, the way he confronted her (grabbing the box and going to the bathroom) might have been a privacy violation, even if he didn't mean to be nosy. \n\nBut the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a heavy accusation. If it's false, the author's reaction is justified in ending the relationship. If it's true, then his reaction is inconsiderate. Since we don't have the full truth, it's hard to say, but the author's immediate disbelief and harsh reaction might make him the asshole if the girlfriend was genuinely in a dangerous situation. However, given the red flags and the condoms, maybe he's not wrong to be suspicious. \n\nThe community often looks at situations like this and considers trust and communication. The author didn't trust his girlfriend's explanation, but instead of discussing it, he ended things. That could be seen as not handling it maturely. On the other hand, if he had a legitimate reason to doubt her, maybe he's not the asshole. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B (the author isn't in the wrong) because he had reasons to be suspicious, and the girlfriend's explanation didn't add up. But the way he handled it could be problematic. However, AITA threads often consider the immediate actions. The girlfriend accused him of not caring, but he was angry and hurt. So maybe he's not the asshole. I'm leaning towards B.\n"
