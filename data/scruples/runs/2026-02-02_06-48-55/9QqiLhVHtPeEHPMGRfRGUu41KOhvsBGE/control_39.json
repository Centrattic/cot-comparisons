Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, was acting suspiciously. He noticed her looking for her phone anxiously, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and then finding a box of Magnum condoms in her purse. When confronted, she said she was being raped, but he didn't believe her, thinking it was a side effect of being abused and not being able to leave. He ended the relationship and now is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's GF claims she was being raped, which is a serious allegation. But the author didn't believe her, based on his observations and the fact that she had condoms, was dressed up, etc. He took the side of doubting her, leading to a breakup. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If someone reports being raped, the default should be to believe them. However, there's also the aspect of the behavior that the author observed, which he found suspicious. But even if there are red flags, the appropriate response might not be to immediately assume she's lying. Also, the fact that she had condoms doesn't necessarily mean she's lying about rape. Condoms could be for protection in a situation where she's forced into sex. The author's reaction\u2014kicking her out and cutting her off\u2014seems harsh, especially if she's in a vulnerable state. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author felt betrayed and humiliated. He was in a situation where he found evidence that made him question her fidelity. However, the key point is that she claimed it was non-consensual. The author's skepticism could be seen as not supporting her, especially if she was in an abusive situation. \n\nIn many cases, when someone discloses abuse, the correct response is to listen and support them, not to doubt them. The author's immediate reaction was to not believe her, which could be harmful. Even if there were inconsistencies, the right approach is to offer support and help her seek help, not to end the relationship abruptly. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he didn't believe her report of rape, which is a serious issue. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But wait, some might argue that he had reasons to be suspicious. But the problem is in the response. Even if there are red flags, the appropriate action isn't to deny the possibility of her being a victim. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
