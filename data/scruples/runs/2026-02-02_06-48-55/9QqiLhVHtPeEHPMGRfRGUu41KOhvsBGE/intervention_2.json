Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend was talking to someone named Rick. The author noticed some behaviors they found suspicious, like her frantically looking for her phone when they were together and getting dressed up in a more fancy way than usual. Then, when the author found a box of condoms in her purse, they confronted her, leading to her breaking down and saying she was being raped.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for not believing her. I need to consider both sides here. On one hand, the author had concerns and found evidence (condoms) which led them to question her. But on the other hand, the girlfriend claimed she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. The author's reaction was to kick her out after an argument, maybe without fully understanding her situation.\n\nFirst, the author's behavior: they noticed red flags and acted on them. However, instead of addressing the issue with her before finding the condoms, they just let it build up. When they found the condoms, they reacted impulsively, not considering the possibility of other explanations, like she could have been a victim of sexual assault. Their immediate assumption was that she was cheating, which is a big assumption to make without a conversation. \n\nThen, the girlfriend's reaction: when confronted, she said she was being raped. The author's response was anger and disbelief. If someone is a victim of rape, they might not explain it in a way the person expects, especially if they're in shock or trauma. The author didn't give her a chance to explain further, just took it as a lie. Maybe they didn't handle the situation with the sensitivity it required. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned that she couldn't leave, which is a known trauma response for some victims. The author dismissed that explanation, which could be a problem. Trust is a big part of relationships, and the author might have broken that trust by being secretive. But at the same time, the author was in a vulnerable position and felt betrayed.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to assume she was lying without hearing her out. The girlfriend's behavior being out of character could be due to the rape situation. The author's actions led to her being excluded from the relationship, possibly without understanding the real issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's immediate reaction was to accuse and not believe her. That seems harsh, especially considering the seriousness of the rape claim. The author might have acted without giving her a proper chance to explain, which could be seen as wrong. They should have first tried to understand her situation instead of jumping to conclusions based on their own insecurities, even if they had reasons to be suspicious. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
