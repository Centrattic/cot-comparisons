Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. Let's start by going through the situation step by step.\n\nThe author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, was talking to Rick. The author noticed some red flags: she would search for her phone frantically, not listen during conversations, dress up fancy which is unusual, and tilt her phone away. Then, he found condoms in her purse, specifically Magnum which he can't use. This made him think she was cheating. When confronted, she said she was being raped and couldn't leave.\n\nThe author's main question is whether he's the asshole for not believing her. So, the key points here are the GF's claims of being raped versus the author's suspicions of cheating based on the evidence he found.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the situation. The author's GF gave a story that she was being raped, which is a serious allegation. However, there are contradictions in her behavior: dressing up, using Magnum condoms, and the suspicious behavior before the confrontation. The author felt humiliated and kicked her out.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is about believing someone's claim versus the evidence. The author didn't accuse her of lying immediately; he was shocked and angry. But then she claimed it was non-consensual, which seems conflicting with the other actions.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the author didn't have proof of cheating. His assumptions were based on suspicious behavior and the condom. But if the GF actually was being raped, then the author's response might be harsh. However, the GF's story needs to align with the evidence. If she was being forced, why the fancy dresses and the phone antics? That's a red flag for the author, but maybe there's another explanation.\n\nBut the key issue is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain fully. He reacted emotionally by kicking her out. However, the GF's claim of rape is a serious accusation. The author might be wrong for not believing her, but her actions could also be misleading. The problem is that the author isn't in a position to verify the truth beyond what he saw. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's actions led to the breakup. He may have overstepped by not trying to understand her situation better. However, the GF's behavior was suspicious, and the author had a right to be concerned. It's a tough call. But given that the GF claimed she was being raped, the author might be in the wrong for not giving her the benefit of the doubt. However, if she was lying, then he's justified. Without more info, it's hard to say. \n\nBut in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the GF made a serious claim, and the author's reaction was to kick her out without seeking more information, perhaps he is in the wrong. However, if her actions don't align with her story, maybe she's lying. The answer might hinge on whether the author should have believed her despite the inconsistencies. \n\nIn many cases, when someone discloses abuse, it's important to support them. But if there are contradictions, it's tricky. The author's immediate reaction might have been harsh, but he had reasons. However, the GF's claim of rape is a serious matter. So, maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because he acted on his suspicions and found evidence (condoms), but her claim doesn't align. But the author didn't have proof, just assumptions. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. But since the GF claimed rape, the author's disbelief might make him the asshole. But maybe not because her actions were suspicious. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the author could have handled it differently. Instead of kicking her out, he could have tried to understand more. But given the situation, he was hurt and angry. It's a tough call. However, in terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer might be B (no) because the author's actions were based on evidence he found, and he had a right to be concerned. But if the GF was actually being raped, then the author is wrong for not supporting her. But without knowing the truth, it's hard to say. The answer might be B because the author isn't at fault for not believing a possible lie, but the GF's story is conflicting. So, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
