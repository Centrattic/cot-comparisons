Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man who found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and confronted her. She claimed she was being raped, which led to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed suspicious behavior\u2014like her acting strangely when searching for her phone, dressing up unusually, and tilting her phone away. Then he found the condoms and confronted her. She responded by saying she was being raped, which he found hard to believe given the other behaviors.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and the girlfriend's explanation. The author's reaction was to kick her out without fully understanding her side. But the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious accusation. The author is now questioning if he was wrong to not believe her.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone says they're being raped, it's a serious situation that deserves empathy and support. Even if the situation seems inconsistent, it's not up to the partner to judge. The author's immediate reaction was anger and disbelief, which might indicate a lack of support. However, the girlfriend's behavior did include some red flags, which complicates things.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend was indeed being raped, then the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive. However, if she was lying, then maybe the author made a right call. But the problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain further, possibly invalidating her claim. In cases of alleged rape, the onus isn't on the survivor to prove their experience; support is crucial.\n\nSo, even if the author had suspicions, his immediate reaction of anger and not supporting her is problematic. The right approach would be to believe her and help her seek help. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting her despite the inconsistencies.\n"
