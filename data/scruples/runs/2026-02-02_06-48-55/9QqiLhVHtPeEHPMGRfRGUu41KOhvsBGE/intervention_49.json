Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found a box of Magnum condoms in their girlfriend's purse, and based on that, they accused her of cheating. The girlfriend then claimed she was being raped. The author kicked her out, and now they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend says she was getting raped, which is a serious allegation. The author's immediate reaction was to confront her, and she cried, saying she didn't cheat. The author seems to have made the leap from finding condoms to assuming cheating, which the girlfriend denied, citing rape instead. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author act recklessly in their assumptions? The author didn't confirm the facts before reacting. They found condoms, which could be for various reasons\u2014maybe she's preparing for a medical exam, or she's a healthcare worker, or it's for someone else. The author jumped to the conclusion that it was for cheating, which led to a confrontation where the girlfriend claimed rape. \n\nNow, the girlfriend's response about being raped is a serious counter-accusation. Rape is a grave crime, and if true, the author should have taken it seriously and supported her. However, the author's initial assumption was based on circumstantial evidence (condoms, phone behavior, etc.) which might not be reliable. The girlfriend's explanation, while possibly a side effect of abuse, is a valid scenario where someone can be in a non-consensual situation even if they appear to be in a consensual one. \n\nThe author kicked her out without fully understanding the context. If the girlfriend was indeed being raped, the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive. But if the girlfriend was lying about the rape to avoid being blamed for infidelity, then the author might have been justified in their anger. However, the author didn't take a measured approach\u2014instead of confronting her calmly to get more information, they immediately accused her, which could be seen as the wrong approach regardless of the truth.\n\nAlso, the author's behavior like checking her phone, noticing her phone searches, and her appearance changes could be signs of jealousy or lack of trust. The fact that the author resorted to searching her purse and then reacting harshly without communication suggests a lack of trust and possibly overreaction.\n\nIn terms of the question, the author is asking if they're the asshole for thinking their girlfriend wasn't actually getting raped. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's actions led to the breakup, but if the girlfriend was in fact being raped, the author's response could be seen as invalidating her experience. However, if the girlfriend was lying about the rape, the author might have been right to be angry but still handled it poorly.\n\nBut given the information, the author didn't have enough concrete evidence to believe either scenario. The correct approach would be to support her if she was being raped, but since the author didn't do that and instead acted on their assumptions, they might be at fault. However, the girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious one, and the author's reaction of dismissing it as a lie (\"if I dig it'll just be more lies\") might indicate a lack of support for her serious allegation. So the author's immediate assumption that the rape claim is a lie could be the wrong move. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't handle the situation with care and trust, reacting based on suspicion without proper investigation and dismissing a serious claim of rape without giving her the benefit of the doubt.\n"
