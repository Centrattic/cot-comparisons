Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then she claimed she was being raped. He's confused and angry because the circumstances don't add up to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed some red flags, like her acting strangely around her phone and suddenly dressing up more. Then he found the condoms, which he thought were for someone else. When confronted, she said she was being raped. Now, the author is questioning if she's lying and if he's the asshole for not believing her.\n\nOn one hand, believing someone when they say they're a victim of rape is important. It's a serious issue, and not believing someone can be traumatic for the victim. The author's immediate reaction was to question her explanation, which might come off as dismissive. But on the other hand, the circumstances he described (dressing up, having condoms that aren't his size) might make him question the validity of her claim. He did act impulsively by kicking her out, but maybe he felt betrayed or confused.\n\nHowever, the key point here is that the author didn't have any prior evidence that his girlfriend was lying about being raped. He's reacting based on his suspicions and the situation's context, but without concrete proof. The problem is that accusing someone of lying about rape is a serious matter. Even if his instincts were wrong, he should have approached the situation with more empathy and support instead of immediate judgment.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was to cry and say he didn't care, which suggests that she felt hurt and unsupported. The author's response, while possibly based on confusion, could have been more compassionate. He might have assumed the worst without giving her a chance to explain properly. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's about believing someone who says they're a victim of a serious crime. Even if there are inconsistencies, the appropriate response is to believe the person and support them. Dismissing their claim out of suspicion without evidence can be harmful. So, the author's lack of belief and the way he handled the situation (kicking her out immediately) without seeking more information might make him the asshole, even if his instincts were based on observed behaviors.\n\nBut wait, some might argue that he had reasons to be suspicious. However, the act of rape is non-consensual by definition, so dressing up or having condoms doesn't negate that. The author shouldn't judge her experience based on his assumptions. His reaction might stem from mistrust and jealousy, not necessarily the situation itself. The right approach would be to support her regardless of the circumstances and help her seek help if she's in danger.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong for not believing his girlfriend's claim of being raped and for acting out in a way that caused further harm. Even if there were red flags, the response should have been supportive, not dismissive.\n"
