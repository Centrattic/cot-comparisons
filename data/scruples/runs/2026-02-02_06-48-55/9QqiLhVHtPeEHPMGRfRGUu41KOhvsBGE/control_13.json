Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The author, who's in a relationship, noticed some suspicious behaviors in his girlfriend. She was acting strangely around her phone, dressing up a lot more than usual, and he found a box of condoms. When confronted, she said she was being raped, but he didn't believe her and kicked her out. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. He noticed red flags and felt suspicious, which might be normal in a relationship. However, how he handled the situation is questionable. Finding the condoms and immediately assuming infidelity without considering her explanation could be a problem. When she tried to explain that she was being raped, he reacted with anger and disbelief. That's a big issue because if she was actually being raped, his reaction was not supportive.\n\nBut then there's the other angle: the girlfriend said she was being raped but was dressing up for it, had condoms, and gave a vague explanation. The author might be justified in doubting her story because those details seem contradictory. However, it's possible that the situation is more complex. For example, maybe she was being forced into situations where she had to appear willing, or maybe she was in an abusive relationship where she felt she had no choice. The author's immediate reaction of anger and not listening to her could have made things worse.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The author didn't approach the situation with empathy. Instead of trying to understand her side first, he lashed out. Even if his suspicions were right, the way he handled it could be seen as dismissive of her potential trauma. However, if her story was a lie, then his reaction might be more about protecting himself from betrayal.\n\nBut the problem is that he didn't give her a chance to explain properly. He took the worst possible interpretation and ended the relationship immediately. If she was indeed being raped, his reaction could have left her in a dangerous situation. On the other hand, if she was lying, he might have ended the relationship unnecessarily. The author's lack of support and immediate judgment could be seen as the wrong approach regardless of the truth.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were not supportive and could be harmful if she was actually in danger. Even if his suspicions were correct, the way he handled the confrontation was poor. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not listening and for not providing support, even if he had doubts.\n"
