Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation is about his girlfriend's behavior that led him to suspect she was getting raped. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author noticed his girlfriend acting suspiciously\u2014searching frantically for her phone, not paying attention during conversations, dressing up fancy, tilting her phone away. Then he found a box of Magnum condoms in her purse, which led him to conclude she was cheating. When confronted, she claimed she was being raped. The author reacted by kicking her out, and now he's conflicted about whether she's lying.\n\nThe key points here are: the author didn't have any concrete evidence of cheating or rape. His assumptions were based on suspicious behaviors and the presence of condoms. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious accusation. The author didn't investigate further or believe her explanation at face value. Instead, he dismissed it and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. If the girlfriend was telling the truth about being raped, then the author's immediate reaction of disbelief and cutting ties could be seen as hurtful and not supportive. A victim of rape shouldn't be made to feel like they're being accused of lying. On the other hand, the author's concerns about her behavior were valid\u2014condoms and unusual behavior can be signs of infidelity. However, he didn't have proof, and he took a drastic step without giving her a chance to explain properly.\n\nThe girlfriend's explanation about it being a side effect of abuse (like being trapped in an abusive situation) is a serious issue. The author dismissed it quickly, which might not be fair. People in abusive situations can indeed act in ways that seem contradictory, and it's important not to judge without understanding the full context.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was not approaching the situation with empathy and openness. He made an assumption based on circumstantial evidence and didn't validate her claim, which could have been a real issue. However, his suspicion was based on observable behaviors that are often associated with infidelity. But the way he handled it, especially after she claimed rape, was harsh and possibly wrong.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if the author's actions were based on distrust and not supporting his partner in a time of crisis, then he's in the wrong. But if he had reason to be suspicious and she was indeed deceptive, he's not. The problem here is that we don't know the truth. However, the immediate reaction to a claim of rape with disbelief and punishment is typically considered wrong, as it can discourage people from coming forward and may cause further trauma if the claim was genuine.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation with the necessary support and belief in his partner's claim, even if his suspicions were based on some suspicious behavior. The key ethical point is that if someone is genuinely a victim of rape, they deserve support, not accusations.\n"
