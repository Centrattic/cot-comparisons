Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found a box of Magnum condoms in his girlfriend's purse and, based on that and some other suspicious behaviors, concluded she was cheating. But when confronted, she said she was being raped and couldn't leave. The author then kicked her out, feeling confused and hurt, and is now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's actions: he noticed some red flags like her being secretive with her phone, acting distracted, dressing up when she usually doesn't, and then finding the condoms. These things led him to suspect cheating. But he acted on those suspicions without having a proper conversation where she could explain her side. He took it to a conclusion that might not have been accurate, and when she said she was being raped, he reacted with anger and disbelief.\n\nOn the other hand, if she was actually being raped, the author's reaction could be seen as invalidating her trauma. Accusing her of cheating instead of supporting her might be a big mistake. However, the situation is complex because there are conflicting signs: the condoms, the secrecy, and her claim of being non-consensual. It's possible that she's lying about the rape, or maybe there's a misunderstanding (like the condoms are for protection in a non-romantic context, or she's being manipulated by someone else). But it's also possible that she's in a real abusive situation and the author's reaction made things worse.\n\nNow, the key points are whether the author acted in a way that's reasonable given the situation. Trust is a big part of relationships. If he didn't have prior reasons to distrust her, jumping to conclusions might be hasty. However, when she presented an alternative explanation (rape), he dismissed it as a lie without giving her a chance to elaborate. That could be seen as not taking her seriously, especially if she's genuinely in danger. But if she's lying, then his reaction might be justified. However, the way he reacted\u2014kicking her out immediately after she said she was being raped\u2014could be seen as not supporting her in a time of need. \n\nAnother angle: when someone says they are being raped, it's a serious accusation. The author's immediate reaction was anger and disbelief, which might be harmful. Even if he suspected infidelity, he should have taken a step back, tried to understand her explanation, and perhaps encouraged her to seek help if she was in danger. Instead, he cut off communication, which could leave her isolated if she's telling the truth.\n\nBut there's also the issue of consent and evidence. The author has his own red flags and found condoms, which he believed were for his use but were Magnum. That's a key detail\u2014Magnum condoms implying someone else's size, which he can't fit. That's a valid reason to be suspicious. However, the conclusion that she's cheating is a jump. He didn't present evidence, just his own assumptions. When she said she was a victim, he didn't pause to consider that maybe she was in a situation where she couldn't fight back, hence the need for condoms (maybe for protection against STIs if she's being forced). His reaction might have been impulsive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the woman was actually being raped, then he failed to support her. If she was lying, then he acted on his suspicions. But the way he confronted her and then kicked her out without giving her a chance to explain further could be seen as the wrong approach. In either case, the immediate reaction might be hasty. The author might be the asshole for not listening to her explanation and taking drastic action without verifying the truth. Alternatively, if she was lying, he might be right to break up with her. But the way he handled it\u2014dismissing her \"rape\" claim as a lie without giving her space to explain\u2014could be the problem.\n\nIn most cases, when someone discloses abuse, the appropriate response is to support them, not to accuse them of lying. Even if there are doubts, a better approach would be to ask for more details or encourage her to report it. So, if the author didn't do that and instead reacted with anger, he might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't believe her claim of rape and acted on his suspicion without proper investigation, potentially invalidating her possible trauma.\n"
