Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, but she claims she was being raped. He found condoms in her purse, which led to a confrontation where she said she was a victim. The author then kicked her out, feeling hurt and betrayed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's actions stem from suspicion and finding evidence (the condoms). However, his immediate conclusion was that she was cheating, not considering other possibilities. When she revealed she was being raped, he reacted with anger and disbelief, which might be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was indeed being raped, the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive or not supportive. However, the context is that she was acting suspiciously, and the author had reasons to be concerned. The girlfriend's explanation about being abused might be a stretch if she was also engaging in behaviors like dressing up and hiding her phone. \n\nBut the key point here is the author's response. Instead of listening to her explanation and offering support, he immediately doubted her. If she was indeed a victim, his reaction could be harmful. However, without more evidence, it's hard to say if she was lying or if he misunderstood. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be at fault for not giving her the benefit of the doubt and reacting with anger instead of seeking to understand. Trust issues and jealousy can cloud judgment, but the way he handled the situation\u2014kicking her out without a thorough discussion\u2014could be seen as harsh. However, if her claims of being raped were fabricated, then the author might be justified. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the immediate judgment without considering her side could make him the asshole. \n\nSo, considering the dynamics of trust and how he handled the confrontation, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong). But there's a lot of nuance here. The girlfriend's behavior was suspicious, but his response was to accuse and leave instead of supporting her if she was truthful. That's a big part of why he might be considered at fault.\n"
