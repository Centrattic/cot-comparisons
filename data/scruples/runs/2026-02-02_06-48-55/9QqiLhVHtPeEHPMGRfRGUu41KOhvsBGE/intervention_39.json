Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who's the one asking if they're the asshole) is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's behavior that the author found suspicious, leading to a conflict where the author accuses her of cheating, and she claims she's being raped.\n\nFirst, the author notices several red flags: her searching for her phone frantically, acting distracted during conversations, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and finding condoms in her purse. When confronted, the girlfriend breaks down and says she's being raped. The author reacts by kicking her out, leading to the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question.\n\nNow, the key points here are the accusations and the reactions. The author's actions stem from suspicion and betrayal, but the girlfriend claims a serious crime. The problem is that the author didn't verify the girlfriend's claim before taking action. Instead of calmly discussing or seeking evidence, the author immediately assumed the worst and ended the relationship without hearing her out. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior (using condoms, dressing up) doesn't align with someone being a victim of rape. Typically, rape is a violent crime, not something that involves consensual activities like using condoms or dressing up for the occasion. The author's intuition here might be pointing to cheating rather than actual assault. However, the girlfriend's assertion that she's being raped is a serious accusation, and dismissing it entirely could be problematic. \n\nBut here's the catch: if the girlfriend was actually being raped, the author should have taken that claim seriously and supported her instead of reacting with anger and breaking up. However, the girlfriend's behavior contradicts her claim, which makes the author's suspicion more plausible. The author might not be the asshole for having doubts, but reacting by kicking her out without evidence or a proper conversation is where the mistake lies. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's explanation about not being able to leave because of abuse is a common trope in situations where someone can't leave a harmful relationship, but this is typically in cases of ongoing abuse, not a one-time incident. The fact that she was using condoms suggests some level of agency, which complicates the rape claim.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author should have handled the situation with more care. Instead of jumping to conclusions and ending the relationship abruptly, he should have asked for more information, maybe encouraged her to seek help if she was in danger, or involved a professional. His immediate reaction of anger and breaking up without understanding her side could be seen as dismissive, especially if she was genuinely in distress. However, given the contradictions in her story, his suspicion isn't entirely unfounded.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did act on suspicion without verifying the facts, which is a mistake. However, the girlfriend's behavior and the context suggest that her claim might not be genuine, which adds complexity. The author's actions might have been harsh, but his initial suspicion could be justified. However, the way he handled it\u2014without listening or seeking evidence\u2014is where he's at fault. Therefore, the answer is A: Yes, he is the asshole because he didn't handle the situation properly, even if his suspicions were somewhat warranted.\n"
