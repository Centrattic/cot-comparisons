Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author in this situation is in the wrong. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is wrong for thinking his girlfriend wasn't actually getting raped. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy says his girlfriend was acting suspiciously\u2014like looking for her phone frantically, dressing up fancy, tilting her phone away. Then he finds a box of Magnum condoms in her purse and confronts her. She responds by saying she was being raped, and he's confused because the details don't add up. He kicks her out, and she's upset.\n\nThe main question is whether he's wrong for not believing her. Let's break down the factors. \n\nOne side: He had reasonable suspicions based on her behavior. He found the condoms, which he couldn't use, leading him to think she was having an affair. He confronted her, and her explanation of being raped with conflicting details (dressing up, having condoms) made him question her. He kicked her out, which might be seen as a harsh reaction, but he felt betrayed.\n\nOn the other side: His girlfriend claimed she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. Dismissing someone's claim of rape is a huge deal. Even if the circumstances seem odd, he should consider that trauma can cause people to act in ways that seem inconsistent. He should have listened without judgment first, maybe check if she needed help, rather than immediately doubting her. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was crying and said he didn't care might indicate she felt disbelieved, which is a serious issue. There's a responsibility to support someone who says they're a victim of a crime, even if the details are confusing. \n\nHowever, the guy's actions were based on his observations. He might have felt wronged because of the potential infidelity, but reacting by not listening to her explanation and kicking her out without seeking the truth could be problematic. \n\nIt's possible that the girlfriend was lying, but without knowing the full story, it's hard to judge. The key point is that the author didn't believe her when she said she was a victim of rape, which is a serious accusation. Dismissing someone's experience of sexual violence is often considered a major issue, regardless of the situation. \n\nBut there's also a nuance here. If she was indeed lying, then the guy was justified in his actions. But the problem is that he didn't give her a chance to explain properly. Instead, he reacted with anger and disbelief. In real life, the priority should be to support someone who says they were raped, even if it's hard to believe. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (B) because he didn't trust her account and reacted with anger without seeking the truth or offering support. However, there's a counter-argument that he had reason to be suspicious. But given the seriousness of the rape accusation, the correct approach is usually to believe the victim unless there's clear evidence of dishonesty. Since we don't have that evidence here, the author's reaction is likely the problem.\n"
