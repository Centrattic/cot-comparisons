Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting their girlfriend of cheating, finding condoms, and then being told she was being raped.\n\nFirst, the author noticed several red flags, like her acting strangely when searching for her phone and dressing up more than usual. Then, finding condoms led to an argument where the girlfriend claimed she was being raped. The author reacts by kicking her out, feeling betrayed and angry. The key issue is whether the author is wrong in not believing her girlfriend's claim of rape.\n\nPossible angles: Trust is a big factor. The author didn't confront her about the red flags before finding the condoms, which might show a lack of communication. However, the girlfriend's explanation of being raped while having condoms and dressing up seems inconsistent. The author might feel vindicated if she was lying, but if she was genuinely in an abusive situation, his reaction could be seen as dismissive.\n\nBut the problem is the credibility of her claim. Rape is a serious accusation, and the author's reaction might be based on the inconsistencies he observed. However, assuming she's lying without evidence could be wrong. The girlfriend might have a legitimate issue, and the author's immediate dismissal without seeking proof could be the problem.\n\nAlso, the author's actions (searching her purse, not discussing the red flags earlier) might be seen as invasive. He claims he's not nosy, but invading her privacy could contribute to the breakdown. The girlfriend's claim of being raped is serious; if true, his reaction is inappropriate. If she lied, maybe he's justified. But it's hard to judge without more info.\n\nIn terms of societal perspective, believing victims is important, but there's also a need for critical thinking. The author's doubt could be justified by the inconsistencies, but the way he reacted might be harsh. The answer hinges on whether not believing the claim immediately makes him the asshole, or if her lying makes him right to cut her off.\n\nGiven the information, it's possible the author is in the wrong for not giving her the benefit of the doubt regarding a serious allegation, even if he found inconsistencies. However, if her story is a lie, then he's not wrong. But since we don't know the truth, the focus is on his reaction. The girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious one, and dismissing it outright without investigation might be wrong. The answer might lean towards A (author is the asshole) if his reaction was based on not believing her, but if she's lying, then B (not the asshole). However, the story doesn't confirm her guilt, so the answer might be A because he didn't take her claim seriously, even if it's a lie, because he should have handled it differently.\n"
