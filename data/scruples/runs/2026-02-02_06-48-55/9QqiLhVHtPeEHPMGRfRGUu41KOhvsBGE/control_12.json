Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating or being a victim of rape, leading to their breakup. \n\nFirst, the author noticed several red flags: his girlfriend acting distracted, being overly made-up, and hiding her phone. When he found condoms in her purse, he confronted her, leading her to claim she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's unsure if he was right to do so.\n\nThe key points to consider are trust and communication in a relationship. The author's actions stem from suspicion and finding physical evidence (condoms), which he interpreted as cheating. However, his girlfriend's immediate reaction and claim of being raped introduce a serious accusation. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014kicking her out without fully hearing her explanation\u2014might be seen as impulsive. Even if he suspected infidelity, a mature approach would involve a calm discussion rather than an abrupt breakup. On the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior was suspicious, and the author had reasons to be concerned. \n\nBut when she mentioned rape, the situation becomes more complex. The author might be in the right to be upset if she was lying, but accusing someone of rape is a heavy charge. The girlfriend's claim without providing a coherent explanation could indicate manipulation. However, the author's approach to handling the situation\u2014confronting her with the condoms and not allowing her to explain further\u2014might have been harsh. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the author had trust issues, he should have addressed them earlier. His reaction might have been a result of jealousy and not properly addressing the underlying issues. However, the presence of physical evidence and her suspicious behavior could justify his concerns. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not giving her a chance to explain before making a decision. Ending the relationship based on suspicion without full understanding could be seen as hasty. On the other hand, if he believed she was being dishonest about a serious matter, his reaction might be understandable. \n\nOverall, while the author had valid reasons to be concerned, his handling of the situation could be seen as lacking in empathy and open communication. He might not be entirely in the wrong, but his approach could have been better. The girlfriend's claim of being raped without evidence also raises questions about her intentions. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole (B), but there are elements where he could have improved. However, given the context and the girlfriend's suspicious behavior, the author's reaction is somewhat justified, so maybe answer B.\n"
