Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, has been acting suspiciously. He notices her frantically looking for her phone when entering the room, not paying attention to conversations, dressing up fancy when she usually doesn't, and tilting her phone away. Then, when he finds a box of Magnum condoms in her purse, he confronts her. She breaks down and says she's being raped. He kicks her out and is now questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. If someone is being raped, that's a serious crime and a traumatic experience. The author's reaction was to immediately reject the explanation and kick her out, which could be seen as dismissive of her potential trauma.\n\nBut there are some red flags. Magnum condoms are typically used for larger penises. The author mentions he can't fit a Magnum, so he assumes she's using them for someone else. However, maybe she's buying them for someone else, or there's another explanation. Also, the GF's behavior of dressing up and acting suspiciously might be part of the abuse scenario. The article she mentions about abused people who can't leave might be a reference to situations where victims feel trapped and can't leave their abusers.\n\nThe author didn't give her a chance to explain further. He reacted based on his assumptions. Even if he found the condoms, the proper approach would be to listen without judgment and offer support, not immediately accuse and kick her out. If she was actually being raped, his reaction could prevent her from getting help. However, he might be right if she was lying and cheating, but the story doesn't confirm that.\n\nThe key points here are about trust, communication, and handling sensitive issues. The author's lack of trust in his GF's explanation and his immediate dismissal of her claim of rape could be problematic. Even if he's suspicious, the way he handled it might have made her feel unsupported, which is crucial in such situations. On the other hand, the GF's behavior and the presence of the condoms might have given him some cause for concern.\n\nBut the main ethical issue here is about the author's response. If someone claims to be a victim of rape, the appropriate response is to support them, not to accuse them of lying. The author didn't give her the benefit of the doubt or the chance to provide more context. His reaction was impulsive and based on his own assumptions rather than listening and seeking the truth in a compassionate way. So, even if there were suspicions, the way he handled it makes him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
