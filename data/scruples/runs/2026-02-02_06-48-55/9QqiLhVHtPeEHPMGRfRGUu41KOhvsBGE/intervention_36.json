Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, who he accuses of cheating after finding condoms in her purse. She claims she was getting raped. The author found the condoms and kicked her out, but she says she's a victim.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author found the condoms and immediately assumed cheating. However, the girlfriend says she was being raped. The author's reaction is harsh\u2014he kicked her out and refuses to communicate. \n\nThe red flags he noticed: her acting nervous, getting dressed up, looking away when texting. But these behaviors could be explained in various ways. The girlfriend's explanation of being a victim of rape is a serious accusation. If true, her actions make sense\u2014she might be in a coercive situation where she's forced to engage in sexual activity, hence the condoms for protection. However, the author dismissed her explanation, thinking she was lying.\n\nBut wait, if she was being raped, why would she be going out with friends dressed up? That part is confusing. However, victims of rape or abuse might still engage in social activities as a coping mechanism. Also, the fact that she had Magnum condoms, which the author can't use, might indicate they're for someone else. But if she's a victim, maybe she's forced to use them regardless of size.\n\nThe author's behavior is problematic. He didn't give her a chance to explain properly. Instead, he reacted with anger and disbelief. When someone discloses a traumatic event like rape, the appropriate response is support, not immediate judgment or punishment. By kicking her out, he's withdrawing support, which could be harmful if she's telling the truth.\n\nHowever, there's a conflict here. If she's lying about rape, the author might be justified in ending the relationship. But the author didn't investigate further or seek evidence. His assumptions could be based on jealousy rather than facts. The girlfriend's behavior might have other explanations beyond cheating or rape. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author handled the situation correctly. Accusing someone of being an \"asshole\" for doubting a rape claim is complicated. On one hand, the author's trust was broken by the condoms and her secrecy. On the other hand, he dismissed her serious accusation without proper investigation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, believing a survivor's account is crucial. Dismissing someone's rape claim without evidence is harmful. However, the author had reasons to be suspicious. The situation is a conflict between two possibilities: cheating or abuse. Without more information, it's hard to say, but the author's immediate dismissal of her explanation and harsh reaction suggest he's at fault for not supporting her if she's a victim. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't support his girlfriend when she made a serious claim and reacted with anger instead of seeking the truth. Answer A.\n"
