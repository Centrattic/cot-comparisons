Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, leading to a confrontation where she claims she was being raped. The key points to consider here are the author's actions, his assumptions, and how he handled the situation.\n\nFirst, the author noticed some behaviors he found suspicious: his girlfriend searching for her phone frantically, dressing up unusually, and tilting her phone away. These observations led him to believe she was cheating. Then, he found condoms in her purse, which he assumed were not for him because of the brand. He confronted her by taking the condoms and going into the bathroom, which might have been an aggressive move without giving her a chance to explain.\n\nWhen she responded by saying she was being raped, the author reacted with anger and disbelief, calling her out for contradictions\u2014like being \"dolled up\" and having condoms. He then kicked her out. The girlfriend claims she was being abused, which is a serious accusation. The author's immediate dismissal of her claim without further investigation could be problematic. He didn't take her at face value and instead assumed she was lying, which might be a mistake if her statement was true.\n\nHowever, the author had prior concerns and evidence (the condoms) that led him to his conclusion. The girlfriend's response seems to have been a last-minute defense to avoid being blamed for cheating. The fact that she \"froze\" when he found the condoms might indicate guilt rather than distress. Also, her explanation about being a victim of abuse, if true, would require a different response, but the author might not have had enough information to verify her claim at the time.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author's trust was broken, and he had reasons to be suspicious. However, his reaction could have been more constructive. Instead of immediately kicking her out without seeking clarification, he might have needed to approach the situation with more empathy or seek evidence to verify her claims. On the other hand, if the girlfriend was indeed lying about being raped to cover up cheating, then the author's reaction, while harsh, might be understandable from a personal standpoint.\n\nThe key issue here is the balance between trusting a partner's claim of abuse and addressing the evidence of infidelity. If the author dismissed her rape claim too quickly without considering her possible trauma, he could be in the wrong. However, if her story was fabricated, his reaction is justified. The scenario doesn't provide enough information to confirm the truth, but the author's immediate judgment and lack of follow-up could make him the asshole if her claim was genuine.\n\nIn many cases, when someone discloses abuse, the appropriate response is to support them rather than question their story, especially in the moment. The author's anger and refusal to consider the possibility that she was being abused, without giving her space to explain further, could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (author in the wrong) if we prioritize the importance of believing victims of abuse. However, if the context shows the girlfriend's story is inconsistent, then B (not in the wrong) could be the case. Given the ambiguity, but emphasizing the importance of not dismissing abuse claims, the answer is likely A.\n"
