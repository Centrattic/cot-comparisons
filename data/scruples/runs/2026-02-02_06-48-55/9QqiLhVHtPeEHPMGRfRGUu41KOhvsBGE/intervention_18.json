Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy finding a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then reacting strongly when she tells him she was being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy noticed some suspicious behaviors: she was acting distracted, dressing up unusually, and hiding her phone. Then he found the condoms, which led him to think she was cheating. When confronted, she said she was being raped, which surprised him. He kicked her out, and now he's unsure if he was wrong.\n\nThe main question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he had no proof and acted on suspicion, which can be problematic. Trust is important in a relationship, and jumping to conclusions without evidence can be hurtful. However, the girlfriend's behavior was unusual, and his reaction, while harsh, might stem from feeling betrayed. But when she says she's being raped, that's a serious accusation. He didn't believe her, which could be a big mistake if she was telling the truth. \n\nBut there are inconsistencies in her story. If she was being raped, why have the condoms? Why dress up? The girlfriend's explanation about being abused and unable to leave is possible, but it's hard to verify. The guy's immediate reaction was to kick her out, which might be too quick without fully understanding her side. However, if she was lying about being raped to cover up cheating, that's a different issue.\n\nThe problem is that the guy didn't give her a chance to explain properly. He assumed she was lying when she made a serious claim. If she was actually being raped, his reaction could invalidate her trauma. On the other hand, if she was lying, then his reaction is justified. But without knowing the truth, it's hard to say. However, the way he reacted\u2014kicking her out and not allowing her to explain further\u2014suggests he didn't handle it well. \n\nAlso, the fact that he went through her purse without asking is a privacy violation, which could have contributed to the breakdown. Trust issues and lack of communication are on both sides. The guy's actions, while possibly stemming from hurt, were confrontational and didn't allow for a constructive conversation. \n\nIn many cases, when someone accuses a partner of infidelity, it's possible they are lying. But when they claim a serious crime like rape, dismissing it without proper consideration can be harmful. The author didn't believe her and reacted angrily, which could be the wrong move. However, the inconsistencies in her story (condoms, dressing up) do raise doubts. \n\nBut in a healthy relationship, trust is key. The guy's behavior of checking her phone, her purse, and the overall lack of trust might have contributed to the situation. His reaction was extreme, and instead of listening, he became defensive and angry. So, even if he felt betrayed, his approach was flawed. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably acted in the wrong by not giving her a chance to explain properly and by violating her privacy. Even if there were red flags, the way he handled the situation\u2014especially after she mentioned rape\u2014was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
