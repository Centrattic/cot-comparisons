Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, was accused of cheating. The author found condoms in her purse and, instead of talking it out, immediately assumed she was cheating. Then she claimed she was being raped. The author kicked her out and is now wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he went through her purse without permission and took out the condoms. That's a violation of privacy. Even if he was suspicious, invading someone's privacy like that is a big issue. He didn't confront her calmly or ask her about the situation first. Instead, he acted rashly, which could be seen as his fault.\n\nThen when she said she was being raped, he reacted with anger, not empathy. If someone says they're being raped, the immediate reaction should be to support them, not accuse them of lying. The author didn't give her a chance to explain further, and instead of believing her, he called her out. That's a problem because it's not his place to judge the validity of her claim without evidence. \n\nBut wait, she was in a relationship with him. If she's being raped by someone else, that's a serious situation, but why would she be going out fancy and have condoms? The author is confused because the behavior doesn't align with what he expects from someone being raped. However, it's possible that she's in an abusive situation where she can't leave yet, which is a real issue. The author dismissed her explanation without giving her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe key points here are the invasion of privacy by going through her belongings without consent and the immediate assumption of cheating instead of listening to her explanation. The author's reaction was to kick her out and not engage in a constructive conversation. That's where he's wrong. He should have supported her if she was indeed being abused, but instead, he blamed her for cheating. \n\nAlso, the author's approach to the situation was confrontational without evidence. He didn't check the facts, just jumped to conclusions. So in terms of being a good partner, he failed in both respecting her privacy and supporting her if there was an actual issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A because the author acted inconsiderately and without empathy, invading privacy and not handling the situation properly.\n"
