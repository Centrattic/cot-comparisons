Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong in the situation described. The situation involves a girlfriend named by him as \"Rick\" (probably a typo, maybe she's talking to someone named Rick). The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: her looking for her phone, acting distracted, getting dressed up in a way that's unusual for her, tilting her phone away, and then finding a box of Magnum condoms. When confronted, she says she was being raped, which he doesn't believe because of the context. He then breaks up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The author's actions are based on his suspicions and the evidence he found. But when she claims she's being raped, he dismisses her. The central issue is whether he was wrong in not believing her.\n\nIn cases of alleged sexual assault, the default should be to believe the victim. However, the author is in a relationship with her, and he has his own red flags. But the problem here is that he's making a judgment call based on his own observations and the presence of condoms. The fact that she said she was being raped is a serious accusation, and his immediate reaction is to accuse her of lying, which is problematic. Even if he had doubts, the appropriate response would be to support her, report the situation to authorities, or encourage her to seek help rather than ending the relationship and not believing her.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author found the Magnum condoms, which he couldn't use himself. That might imply that she was planning to have sex with someone else, but that doesn't necessarily confirm that she's lying about being raped. Rape is a non-consensual act, and the presence of condoms could be for protection if she's being forced. However, the author's reaction was to not believe her, which is harmful. If someone says they're being raped, even if there are suspicious circumstances, the correct approach is not to confront them in a way that causes them to feel attacked. Instead, offer support and help. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014kicking her out, not listening further, and not seeking evidence\u2014suggest that he dismissed her claim without proper investigation or support. Even if he had doubts, the way he handled it was wrong. The girlfriend's reaction of crying and feeling humiliated indicates that he didn't approach the situation with care. \n\nIn many cases, when someone reports a sexual assault, the first people they tell might be partners or close friends, and the response can significantly impact their ability to seek help. If the author had believed her, supported her, and encouraged her to report the incident, that would be the right approach. But by not believing her and cutting off the relationship, he's failing to support her in a time of crisis.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the red flags he noticed. But red flags don't necessarily mean cheating or lying. People can have complex situations. The fact that she was getting dressed up and acting strangely might have other explanations. But when she makes a serious claim like being raped, the immediate reaction should be to support, not to doubt and punish. \n\nSo considering all this, the author is wrong in not believing her and breaking up with her in that manner. The correct response would be to not assume guilt, even with suspicions, and to handle the situation with empathy and support. Therefore, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
