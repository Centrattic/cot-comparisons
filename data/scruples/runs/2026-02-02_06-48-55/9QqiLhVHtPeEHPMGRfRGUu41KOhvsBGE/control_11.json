Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting their girlfriend of cheating, leading to a confrontation where she claims she was being raped. The key here is understanding whether the author's actions were justified or if they made a mistake.\n\nFirst, the author noticed some red flags: the girlfriend was acting suspiciously around her phone, dressing up unusually, and had condoms in her purse. He found the condoms and confronted her, leading her to claim she was being raped. The author then kicked her out, feeling betrayed and angry. The question is whether he was wrong to do so.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. The author might have felt justified in confronting her based on suspicious behavior, but the way he did it\u2014finding the condoms without her consent and then confronting her abruptly\u2014could be problematic. Condoms being present doesn't necessarily mean cheating; there are other possibilities, like self-defense or medical reasons. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious accusation. If she was indeed being raped, the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive or not taking her seriously. But if her story doesn't add up (like dressing up and having condoms for a non-consensual act), the author might have been right to be skeptical.\n\nHowever, the author's approach was confrontational and possibly invasive (going through her purse without permission). That could have escalated the situation. Also, the girlfriend's emotional reaction might indicate genuine distress, but it's unclear if her claim is truthful. The author's decision to end the relationship immediately might be seen as hasty, especially without seeking more information or support. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The author might have acted out of hurt and mistrust, which is a common issue in relationships. However, the way he handled the situation\u2014especially the invasion of privacy and quick judgment\u2014could be seen as wrong. On the other hand, if the girlfriend was lying about the rape, then the author's skepticism makes sense. But without knowing the full truth, it's hard to say. The key issue here is the method of confrontation and the lack of trust. In a healthy relationship, communication and trust are essential. The author's actions suggest a breakdown in both, which could place the blame on him for not trusting his partner and reacting impulsively. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because of his handling of the situation rather than the initial suspicion.\n"
