Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who claims she's being raped but there are some conflicting signs.\n\nFirst, the author noticed some red flags like her acting strangely around him, getting dressed up more, and then finding condoms. When he confronts her, she says she's being raped. The author is upset and breaks up with her. The question is whether he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions\u2014like searching her purse and finding the condoms\u2014could be seen as an invasion of privacy. Even if he was suspicious, taking the box and confronting her in the bathroom without talking might have been harsh. Also, dismissing her claim of being raped immediately might show a lack of empathy. If she was actually being raped, he should have supported her rather than reacting emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation is complicated. The girlfriend's behavior is inconsistent with her claim of being raped. The fact that she had condoms suggests possible consensual encounters, which contradicts her story. The author might have felt betrayed and acted out of anger. However, he should have handled it more carefully, maybe by listening first before making a judgment or breaking up with her.\n\nThe key points here are communication and trust. The author didn't give her a chance to fully explain her side, which could have led to a better understanding. His immediate reaction might have been too quick, especially if she was indeed in a vulnerable situation. But her actions do raise questions. However, accusing someone of cheating without proof and reacting with anger could be seen as hasty, even if he was suspicious.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have made mistakes. The author didn't handle the situation with care, and the girlfriend's explanation didn't align with her actions. But in terms of who's 'in the wrong' more, the author's reaction\u2014breaking up and not giving her a chance\u2014might be the bigger issue. However, finding proof of cheating would make him not the asshole. The problem is the uncertainty here. Since the situation is ambiguous, but the author's approach was confrontational and dismissive of her claim, he might be in the wrong for not supporting her first.\n"
