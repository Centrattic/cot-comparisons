Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who claims she was being raped, but the author is skeptical because of some behaviors he observed, like her acting strangely around her phone, dressing up, and finding condoms in her purse. He ended up breaking up with her because he didn't believe her explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The girlfriend said she was being raped, which is a serious allegation. The author's response was to kick her out and not talk to her anymore. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a position where he found physical evidence (condoms) and noticed suspicious behavior. He might have felt betrayed or confused. But on the other hand, he's dismissing her claim of being raped without giving her a chance to explain further. Rape is a serious issue, and it's important to believe victims. However, there are also cases where people might misuse such claims, but that's not common.\n\nThe author's immediate reaction was to break up instead of seeking more information or supporting her. If she was genuinely being raped, his reaction might be seen as not supportive. But if she was lying, then he's protecting himself from a betrayal. However, the way he handled it\u2014without fully understanding the situation\u2014could be problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior (dressing up, acting oddly) might be part of a scenario where she's in an abusive situation and can't leave, as she mentioned. Maybe she's trying to comply to some extent, hence the fancy clothes and condoms. But that's just speculation. The author didn't give her a chance to explain properly.\n\nIn terms of trust, once trust is broken, relationships can be difficult. But the author acted on his own assumptions without verifying the facts. It's possible that his judgment was clouded by jealousy and the discovery of the condoms, leading him to dismiss her serious claim.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't support her and broke up without giving her a proper explanation. However, there's a counterargument that he's justified in being suspicious. But given the gravity of a rape accusation, the appropriate response would be to support her and encourage her to seek help, not to dismiss her immediately. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation appropriately, especially if she was telling the truth.\n"
