Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who the author believes is cheating, leading to a conflict where the girlfriend claims she was being raped.\n\nFirst, the author found condoms in his girlfriend's purse and immediately assumed she was cheating. The girlfriend then says she was being raped. The author is conflicted because he's upset about the cheating but also confused by her explanation. \n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If the girlfriend was being raped, that's a serious crime. The author's immediate reaction was to kick her out, which could be seen as not supporting her during a traumatic time. However, the author also points out inconsistencies: she was dressing up, had condoms, and her behavior seemed off. \n\nBut wait, rape is a non-consensual act, and having condoms doesn't necessarily mean it's consensual. Maybe she had them for protection, but if the act wasn't consensual, then it's still rape. The author's judgment based on the condoms and her behavior might be hasty. He didn't give her a proper chance to explain, just reacted emotionally. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's response of \"it could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave\" is a bit unclear. Maybe she's referring to being in an abusive situation where she can't leave, but that doesn't explain the condoms. However, the author's immediate assumption of cheating without considering her statement about being raped could be a problem. \n\nIn some cases, people in abusive relationships might have to engage in unsafe sex or have items that seem contradictory. The author's reaction of not believing her and ending the relationship might make him the asshole because he didn't support her, especially if there's a possibility she was telling the truth. \n\nBut then again, the author has every right to be upset about the condoms and the suspicious behavior. The issue is the lack of communication and the immediate judgment without a full explanation. The author might be in the wrong for not listening and for assuming the worst without considering her perspective. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A because the author didn't handle the situation with enough empathy and rushed to judgment without fully understanding her claims, even if they were questionable. The girlfriend's rape claim is serious, and the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her potential trauma.\n"
