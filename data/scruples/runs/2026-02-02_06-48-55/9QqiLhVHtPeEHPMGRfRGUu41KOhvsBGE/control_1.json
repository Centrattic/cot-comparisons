Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy finds a box of Magnum condoms in his girlfriend's purse when he's looking for Advil. He immediately assumes she's cheating and kicks her out. But she claims she was being raped, which he doesn't believe because of the fancy outfits and condoms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girl says she's being raped, which is a serious allegation. The guy, instead of trusting her, jumps to conclusions based on the condoms and her behavior. But wait, Magnum condoms are a size that's larger than average, which might imply that the partner is larger, which he points out he can't fit. That could be a clue. However, there's no medical evidence or any other proof presented here. \n\nThe guy's actions are based on suspicion and not on evidence. He found the condoms, but that alone doesn't prove cheating. Maybe the girl was buying them for another reason. But he doesn't consider other possibilities. Also, he invaded her privacy by going through her purse, which is a no-go in relationships. That's a breach of trust right there.\n\nWhen she says she's being raped, he calls her out on it, which might have been traumatic for her. If she was actually being raped, his reaction could prevent her from coming forward again. But then again, if she was lying, he's being too quick to believe her. But the problem is, he didn't take her seriously when she made a serious claim. \n\nThere's a balance between protecting oneself from infidelity and supporting a partner through a traumatic experience. He didn't handle it well. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. Instead of accusing her, he should have asked for an explanation. But his actions were rash. \n\nHowever, the fact that she was acting suspiciously and there were red flags (like hiding her phone, acting distant) might have contributed. But that's not an excuse for not trusting her when she made a serious claim. \n\nIn terms of the question, is he in the wrong? He invaded her privacy by checking her purse, which is a breach of trust. Then, when she made a claim of being raped, he didn't support her but instead reacted with anger. Even if he was wronged, his response was inappropriate. The act of immediately kicking her out without understanding the context is harsh. \n\nBut the key point is that he didn't give her the benefit of the doubt. If someone says they're being raped, the appropriate response is to support them and seek help, not to accuse and kick them out. So, even if he had suspicions, his reaction was wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation properly, breached trust, and didn't support her when she made a serious claim.\n"
