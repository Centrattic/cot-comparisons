Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's trying to decide if he's the asshole (AITA) for thinking his girlfriend wasn't actually getting raped. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been talking to someone named Rick. The guy notices some red flags: she's acting strangely when he's around, searching for her phone, not engaging in conversations, and then when she leaves, she's dressed up a lot more than usual. Then there's the condom box, which he takes as evidence. He confronts her, she says she's being raped, and he kicks her out. Now he's conflicted because she's crying and says he doesn't care about her.\n\nSo the main question is: is he wrong for not believing her? Well, believing someone's claim of being raped is a serious matter. Rape is a traumatic experience, and it's crucial to support survivors. But the guy here is questioning the validity of her claim based on his observations. However, his reasoning is problematic. Assuming that someone can't be raped if they're dressed a certain way or have condoms is a form of victim-blaming. That's a big red flag. \n\nThe guy's actions\u2014like going through her purse and finding the condoms\u2014could be seen as invading her privacy. Even if he was suspicious, he should have had an open conversation instead of taking matters into his own hands. His reaction of immediately doubting her and kicking her out without giving her a chance to explain further is harsh. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior, like acting oddly and being dressed up, could be explained by other factors. It's not right to assume infidelity without evidence, but it's also wrong to use those assumptions to disbelieve a claim of rape. Rape is not about the victim's appearance or behavior; consent is the key factor. The guy's judgment based on superficial signs is flawed.\n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's response about being abused and unable to leave is a common dynamic in abusive situations. Even if it's true, the guy's reaction of not supporting her and cutting her off could be harmful. He's in a position to offer support, not judgment. By not believing her, he might be invalidating her experience, which is a serious issue.\n\nSo putting it all together, the guy made several mistakes: invading privacy, making assumptions without evidence, and disbelieving her. His actions and judgment are harmful and wrong. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
