Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend allegedly being raped by someone named Rick, but the author is having trouble believing her because of certain behaviors and the discovery of a box of condoms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions several red flags: the girlfriend acting suspiciously when checking her phone, suddenly dressing fancy, tilting her phone away, and the discovery of condoms. The girlfriend later claims she was being raped, but the author doesn't believe her and breaks up with her. The author is conflicted because he wants to believe her but also feels lied to.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend's behavior is indeed suspicious, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's lying. People in abusive situations might act out of character due to fear, manipulation, or trauma. The author made an accusation (AITA) implying that the girlfriend was cheating, but she claims it's about being raped. If the girlfriend is telling the truth, the author is dismissing a serious crime and potentially blaming the victim. However, if she's lying, the author is right to be skeptical. \n\nBut here's the thing: without evidence, the author is making a judgment call based on circumstantial evidence and his own assumptions. The girlfriend's explanation about being abused and unable to leave is something that should be taken seriously. The author's reaction of not believing her and breaking up could be seen as not supporting her, especially if she's in a real situation. \n\nHowever, the author's discovery of the condoms is a physical clue. If the girlfriend was being raped, why would there be condoms? That's a contradiction. But again, without knowing the full context, it's possible she was in a consensual situation initially but later became non-consensual, or perhaps she's being manipulated. The author might be in a position where he can't trust her, but accusing her of lying without proof could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is being manipulated by his girlfriend to cover up something else, then he's reacting appropriately. But the scenario is presented as an AITA, so the user is asking if the author is the asshole. In terms of social norms, accusing someone of lying about a rape, especially when they claim it's non-consensual, can be seen as extremely insensitive and potentially blaming the victim. The author's immediate reaction was to kick her out without seeking more information, which might be harsh if she's in genuine distress.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer hinges on the balance between the author's right to question suspicious behavior and the seriousness of the girlfriend's claim. If the author is correct in his skepticism, he's not the asshole. But if the girlfriend is telling the truth, he's wrong to dismiss her. However, from an outsider's perspective, the author has valid concerns but might be jumping to conclusions. The situation is complex, but the girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious accusation that should be treated with care. The author could have sought more information or encouraged her to report the incident rather than immediately doubting her. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not believing her without concrete evidence against her.\n"
