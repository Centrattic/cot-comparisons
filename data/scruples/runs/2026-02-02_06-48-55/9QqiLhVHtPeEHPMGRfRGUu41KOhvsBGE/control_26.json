Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy found a box of Magnum condoms in his girlfriend's purse and assumed she was cheating. Then she told him she was being raped, and he kicked her out. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. The guy noticed some red flags, like her acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up out of the blue, tilting her phone away. These behaviors could be suspicious, but they might not necessarily mean cheating. People have different reasons for their actions. But the key here is when he found the condoms. Magnum condoms are a specific type, and he mentions he can't even fit them, so he immediately thought it was for someone else. \n\nBut then his girlfriend says she was being raped. That's a serious accusation. Now, if she was being raped, that's a traumatic experience, and bringing up that kind of information in a relationship is huge. The guy's reaction was to kick her out and call her a liar. But is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, he had reasons to be suspicious, but he didn't give her a chance to explain. He took the worst possible interpretation without verifying the facts. When she told him about being raped, he didn't believe her and reacted with anger. That's a problem. If someone is being raped, that's a serious issue, and the response should be supportive, not immediately dismissive and punitive. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the condoms. If she was being raped, why does she have Magnum condoms? That seems contradictory. Also, she was dressing up, which might not align with being a victim of rape. But people in abusive situations can be manipulated into certain behaviors. Maybe the rapist forced her into situations where she had to dress up or have condoms as part of the abuse. That's possible. \n\nThe problem is that the guy didn't take her seriously when she brought up the rape. Instead of listening and supporting, he accused her of lying. That's not the right response. If someone is being raped, the partner should be there to help, not immediately break up the relationship based on assumptions. \n\nBut wait, she was the one who told him the rape story. Maybe she was trying to deflect guilt for cheating. But without more context, it's hard to tell. The guy's initial assumption was that she was cheating, then she says something else. He didn't give her a chance to explain the situation. He just took it as another lie. \n\nSo, in terms of the wrong here, the guy made a lot of assumptions without evidence. When confronted with a serious accusation from her, he didn't believe her. That's a problem. Even if he's right about her lying, the way he reacted could have been more respectful. But if she was truly being raped, his reaction was hurtful and dismissive. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points are: did he wrong her by not believing her when she said she was being raped? Because if she was telling the truth, then his reaction was wrong. If she was lying, then maybe he wasn't in the wrong. But the article doesn't give enough info to know who is truthful. \n\nHowever, in general, when someone discloses a traumatic experience like being raped, the appropriate response is to listen and support, not to immediately accuse them of lying and break up. Even if you suspect they're lying, you should handle it with care. So the guy's reaction was inappropriate. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
