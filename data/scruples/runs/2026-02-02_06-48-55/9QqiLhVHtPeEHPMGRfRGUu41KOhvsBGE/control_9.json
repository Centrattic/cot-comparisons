Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, was acting suspiciously. He noticed her searching for her phone nervously, dressing up more than usual, and tilting her phone away. Then he found condoms in her purse, which led him to accuse her of cheating. She responded by saying she was being raped, which he didn't believe, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He went through her belongings (the purse) and found the condoms, which could be seen as invading her privacy. Even if he had suspicions, taking that approach might not be the best. Then, when she says she's being raped, he's dismissive, which is really serious. Believing someone when they say they're being raped is crucial, even if there are conflicting details (like the condoms and the fancy dresses). The author's reaction could come off as not taking her seriously, which is a big problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the GF's behavior was odd. She had red flags that the author noticed. But when she claims she's being raped, the author's response is to kick her out and not listen. That's a bad move because it could leave her in a dangerous situation if it's true. However, if she's lying, he might have been protecting himself. But the way he handled it is toxic and shows a lack of trust and support.\n\nThe key here is that when someone discloses they're being raped, the appropriate response is to believe them, support them, and help them get help. The author's immediate reaction was to accuse and dismiss, which is not the right approach regardless of the truth. That's where he's in the wrong. Even if his suspicions were valid, his method of addressing it was harmful and dismissive. So the answer is A, he's the asshole.\n"
