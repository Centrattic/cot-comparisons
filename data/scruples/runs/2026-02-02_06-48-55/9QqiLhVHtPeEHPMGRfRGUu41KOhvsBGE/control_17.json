Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, who he thinks is cheating, but she claims she was being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author noticed some behaviors: his girlfriend was acting strangely around her phone, dressing up more than usual, and he found condoms in her purse. When confronted, she broke down and said she was being raped. The author then kicked her out, feeling betrayed and not believing her explanation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the possible angles. \n\nOn one hand, the author acted on suspicion without concrete evidence. He found the condoms, which he assumed were for someone else, but he didn't give her a chance to explain properly. Her response about being raped is a serious accusation. If she were truly being raped, his immediate reaction of anger and dismissal could be harmful. He might have invalidated her feelings or not taken her seriously enough. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has his own feelings of betrayal and hurt. He noticed suspicious behavior and found physical evidence. His emotional reaction is understandable, but acting impulsively by kicking her out without a thorough discussion might not have been the best approach. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were justified. The problem is that he didn't handle the situation with care. When someone makes a serious claim like being raped, the appropriate response would be to support them, ensure their safety, and seek help, rather than immediately accusing and ending the relationship. His reaction could be seen as not taking her claim seriously, especially since her explanation was vague. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of his suspicion based on her behavior. If he had no prior issues and this was sudden, his concern isn't entirely unfounded. But the way he handled it\u2014confronting her with the condoms, getting angry, and then kicking her out\u2014could be seen as dismissive. \n\nAnother point to consider is that the girlfriend's explanation about being a \"side effect\" of abuse and not being able to leave is a red flag in itself. That suggests a possible pattern of being in harmful situations. The author might have valid concerns about her judgment or safety, but he didn't follow up properly. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" question, the author's immediate reaction and lack of support for her claim might make him the asshole. However, if her claims are false, then he's not wrong for being suspicious. But without knowing the full truth, it's hard to say. \n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the author gave her a chance to explain properly. He reacted with anger and didn't ensure her safety or offer support. That could make him the asshole for not handling a serious claim appropriately, even if his suspicions were based on some evidence. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't support her claim adequately and acted out of anger without proper investigation. Alternatively, if her claims were lies, he's not wrong. But without knowing the truth, the immediate judgment is on how he handled the situation. The correct approach would be to support her if she's being raped, not to accuse her of cheating without proof. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not taking her claim seriously and reacting in a harmful way.\n"
