Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend and another guy, Rick.\n\nFirst, the author noticed some red flags: girlfriend acting distracted, searching for her phone, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away. Then he found condoms in her purse, which led him to believe she was cheating. When confronted, she said she was being raped. He kicked her out, thinking she was lying. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are trust and communication. The author had suspicions and acted on them, but the girlfriend's response was that she was being raped. If she was being raped, then the author's reaction could be problematic. However, the author's reasoning is that if she's being raped, why is she dressed up, has condoms, and acts in a way that seems like she's planning to meet someone? \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's explanation is that it's a side effect of being abused and she can't leave. That's a serious situation. If she was being manipulated or controlled, she might not be acting in her usual way. The author, however, dismissed her explanation, thinking she was lying. \n\nThe problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain properly. He took the condoms as evidence of cheating and didn't consider other possibilities. Also, his reaction was to break up with her, which is drastic. Even if he was hurt, the way he handled it might have been harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, trust is a two-way street. If there were genuine red flags, maybe he had some concerns. But the conclusion he jumped to was that she was cheating, not considering her claim of being raped. That's a big issue. If she was being abused, he should have supported her instead of accusing her of cheating. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not believing her when she said she was being raped. Even if his instincts were right that she might not be telling the whole truth, he should have sought to understand and support her, especially with such a serious accusation. Breaking up immediately without giving her a chance to explain properly is where he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
