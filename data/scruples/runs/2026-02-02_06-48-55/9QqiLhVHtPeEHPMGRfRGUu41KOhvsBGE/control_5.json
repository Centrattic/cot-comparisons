Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The story involves a girlfriend who claims she's being raped, but the author is skeptical because of some behaviors and a box of condoms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed several red flags like her acting strangely, being secretive with her phone, and changing her appearance. Then, finding a box of condoms led to an argument where the girlfriend says she's being raped. The author can't accept her explanation and breaks up with her.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend claims she's a victim of rape, which is a serious accusation. However, the author's skepticism is based on circumstantial evidence. The girlfriend's behavior, like being fancy and having condoms, seems conflicting. But wait, there's a concept called \"complex trauma\" or \"learned helplessness\" where victims might not act in ways others expect. Also, the girlfriend mentions something about not being able to leave, which could hint at abuse dynamics.\n\nBut the author didn't give her a chance to explain further. He reacted immediately, kicked her out, and didn't seek verification. Trust is crucial in relationships. The author's reaction is based on suspicion without concrete evidence. Even if there are red flags, the girlfriend is accusing of rape, which is a grave matter. The author could be in the wrong for not believing her and acting on his assumptions. However, there's also the issue of her behavior being suspicious. \n\nBut when someone accuses of rape, it's supposed to be taken seriously. Even if there are inconsistencies, the author should consider that victims might act differently. The girlfriend might be in distress and not explaining clearly. The author's actions could be seen as dismissing her trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel betrayed and might not be able to reconcile with the situation. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend is truly a victim, then the author's response is dismissing her suffering. If she's lying, then he's justified. But without knowing the truth, the immediate response to not believe her could be wrong.\n\nThe answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because the girlfriend's explanation is unclear and there are red flags. But I'm conflicted because the accusation of rape is serious. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that he didn't have proof and acted on his suspicions, he might not be wrong. But society expects people to believe victims of sexual assault. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is A, because he didn't give her a chance to explain properly and reacted harshly without evidence. But the girlfriend's story is confusing. Alternatively, since the author's actions were based on his perception, maybe he's not in the wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
