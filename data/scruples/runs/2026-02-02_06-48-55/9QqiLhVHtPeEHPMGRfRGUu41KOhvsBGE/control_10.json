Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author questioning their girlfriend's claim of being raped after finding condoms and other suspicious behaviors.\n\nFirst, the author mentions their girlfriend's unusual behavior: searching for her phone frantically, getting fancily dressed, and tilting her phone away. Then, finding condoms leads to an argument where the girlfriend claims she was being raped. The author reacts by kicking her out, feeling betrayed and angry.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. The girlfriend's actions (condoms, dressing up) seem contradictory to a rape scenario, which could raise questions. However, the author's approach of confronting her by taking the condoms and reacting harshly might be seen as invalidating her claim. Rape is a serious accusation, and the girlfriend might have felt compelled to explain. The author's immediate dismissal of her explanation without further discussion could be problematic. But given the context, the author might have felt hurt and suspicious. \n\nIt's tricky. The author's judgment of the situation based on evidence they observed could be seen as making assumptions, but the girlfriend's behavior did include red flags. However, accusing someone of lying about rape is a serious matter, and the author's response might have been too harsh without fully understanding the context. The girlfriend's claim of being raped needs to be taken seriously, even if the circumstances are confusing. The author's reaction, while understandable in their hurt, might not be the right approach. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not giving her a chance to explain without judgment. But I need to balance the facts here. The author's actions are a response to what they perceived as betrayal, but the girlfriend's claim is serious. The key issue is whether the author is wrong for not believing her. Given that the girlfriend did provide an explanation (even if it's not fully convincing), the author's immediate rejection without seeking more information might be the problem. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they dismissed her claim without proper consideration and reacted by ending the relationship, which could be seen as invalidating her experience. However, the situation is complex. The girlfriend's behavior was suspicious, but the author's response might have been too hasty. The answer here is A.\n"
