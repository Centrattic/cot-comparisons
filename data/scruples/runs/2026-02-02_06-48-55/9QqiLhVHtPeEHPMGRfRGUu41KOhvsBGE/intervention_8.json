Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author, a guy, found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse. He assumed she was cheating because he saw the magnum size (which he can't fit) and she was dressing up for her friends. But when confronted, she said she was being raped. He reacted by kicking her out and not wanting to speak to her anymore. Now he's unsure if he was wrong.\n\nHmm. The initial assumption here is crucial. The author jumped to conclusions based on the condom size and her behavior. But when she explained it was about being raped, that's a serious situation. The problem is, her actions (dressing up, not listening, hiding the phone) don't clearly align with being a rape victim. You'd expect a victim to seek help, not to be secretive and act like she's meeting friends.\n\nBut wait, why would a rape victim have condoms? Maybe she was trying to protect herself from pregnancy if she was being forced. That's a possibility, though it's not the most common scenario. Also, her saying it's a side effect of being abused and can't leave\u2014maybe she's in a controlling relationship where she's forced to go out with people. But that still doesn't explain why she's dressing up and having the condoms. If someone is raping her, wouldn't she try to avoid contact? Unless it's an ongoing situation that's more complex.\n\nThe author's response was to kick her out and cut off contact. That's pretty harsh. But he might be feeling betrayed or shocked. However, if she's a victim of rape, his reaction could be seen as dismissive or invalidating. He didn't give her a chance to explain the situation fully, maybe even with evidence. Just because she didn't act in a way that makes sense doesn't mean she's lying. But on the other hand, if she was being raped, she might be in a situation where she can't leave. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are his initial assumptions. He's accusing her of cheating without proof, and when she gives a serious explanation, he reacts with anger and disbelief. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and if he found something that could indicate cheating, it's natural to be upset. However, when she claims rape, he should consider the seriousness and not just dismiss it as a lie. But maybe she's lying about the rape to cover up cheating. \n\nThe problem is the author didn't take a middle ground. He assumed the worst without evidence and then when she provided a shocking explanation, he didn't validate her feelings or seek more information. Instead, he kicked her out and ended the relationship. That's a big step. If he had calmly asked her to explain more, maybe they could have resolved it. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's wrong to not believe her, then answer A. If he's justified in being suspicious and leaving, then B. But since the story is from his perspective, and he admits he might be wrong for not considering her explanation, it's a bit tricky. However, in a healthy relationship, when someone accuses you of something like this, the response should be supportive. So if he didn't support her and just kicked her out, maybe he's the asshole. But if she lied, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nWait, but the story says she \"immediately broke down crying\" and said she was getting raped. The author then reacts with anger and disbelief. The issue is that he might be invalidating a serious claim. Even if he doubts her, he should approach it with empathy. Kicking her out and cutting off contact without hearing her out could be seen as wrong, especially if she's in a vulnerable situation. But if she was lying, then he's right to leave. \n\nSince the story is presented as \"AITA,\" the author is seeking advice on whether his reaction was justified. The answer would depend on the context. But in general, when a partner makes a serious accusation like being raped, the appropriate response is to be supportive and seek help, not to just end the relationship. However, if the author had prior reason to suspect something else, like cheating, but she's now saying rape, maybe he's confused. \n\nBut the story mentions that her behavior was out of character. She was dressing up, hiding her phone, not paying attention. These could be signs of something else, but the author didn't have direct evidence. The condoms, though, are a point. If she was in a non-consensual situation, having condoms could be a way to prevent pregnancy. But that's not a common scenario. \n\nIn terms of the author's actions, he found the condoms and then reacted with anger and disbelief when she said she was being raped. Instead of calming down and discussing it, he kicked her out. That's a problem. So the answer might be A because he didn't take her claim seriously. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nBut the story says she said it was non-consensual, yet she had the condoms. The author is questioning the logic here. If she's being raped, wouldn't she not be in a position to obtain or use condoms? Unless it's a specific situation where she's being forced by someone else to engage in sex, and she's trying to protect herself. But that's a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she was planning to have sex with friends (cheating) but when confronted, she made up the rape part. So the author's suspicion might be valid, but his reaction was too harsh. \n\nThe answer is probably A because the author didn't support her when she made a serious allegation. Even if he's suspicious, the right approach is to listen and help her report it, not just end the relationship. However, if she was lying, then B. But since we don't know the truth, the question is about the author's actions. \n\nIn most cases, if someone claims they're a victim of rape, the appropriate response is to believe them and offer support. The author didn't do that; instead, he accused her of lying and ended the relationship. So he's the asshole. Answer A.\n"
