Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse, which led him to think she was cheating. But she told him she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's questioning if he was right to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author says his girlfriend acted suspiciously, like searching for her phone frantically, getting dressed up in a fancy way, and tilting her phone away. Then, he found the condoms, which he thought were for him, but realized they weren't because they were Magnum size. He confronted her, she said she was being raped, and he kicked her out. \n\nNow, the key point here is whether the author's reaction was justified. On one hand, if she was actually being raped, his immediate assumption of cheating without understanding her situation could be wrong. But on the other hand, her behavior did seem suspicious, and the existence of condoms in her possession might indicate something else. However, the author's response of kicking her out without listening further might be hasty. \n\nBut here's the thing: if she was actually being raped, his reaction could be seen as dismissive of her trauma. However, her explanation that she was \"getting raped\" while having condoms and dressing up might not align, which the author correctly points out. The fact that she was keeping condoms in her purse could imply she was planning to have sex, which might contradict the non-consensual claim. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another scenario. Maybe she was in a situation where she felt forced but had to take precautions, or maybe she was in a relationship where she couldn't refuse. However, the author's immediate assumption that she was cheating without giving her a chance to explain could be problematic. However, when she told him she was being raped, he reacted strongly, but maybe he should have given her more space to explain instead of immediately kicking her out. \n\nBut the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she was indeed being raped, then his reaction could be harmful. However, if her story is a lie to justify cheating, then he might have been right to break up. The problem is that we don't know the truth. But the person is asking if he's the asshole. \n\nIn such cases, it's important to consider the balance between trusting a partner's disclosure of abuse and the partner's suspicious behavior. If someone discloses being a victim of rape, the appropriate response is to support and believe them, not to confront them about inconsistencies. However, the author found physical evidence (condoms) and suspicious behavior, which could lead to doubt. \n\nBut the fact that she told him she was being raped while having condoms and dressing up in a way that's out of character might be conflicting. However, the author's response was to kick her out without fully understanding her story. In situations where someone discloses abuse, the correct approach is to listen, support, and encourage them to seek help, not to accuse or kick them out. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting her after her disclosure. But there's also the aspect that she may have lied about the rape to cover up cheating. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In the context of the community's view on these kinds of stories, often people are advised to believe their partner if they disclose abuse. So, the author's reaction could be seen as not supporting her, making him the asshole. \n\nBut there's a contradiction in her story. If she was being raped, why would she have condoms? That's a red flag. So maybe the author is right to be suspicious. However, it's possible she was in a situation where she had to have protection for some reason, but that's speculative. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's immediate reaction might be hasty. If she truly was in an abusive situation, his response could be harmful. However, given the inconsistencies, there's a possibility she was lying. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might hinge on the importance of supporting a partner's disclosure of abuse, even if there are doubts. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not supporting her and breaking up without considering her feelings.\n"
