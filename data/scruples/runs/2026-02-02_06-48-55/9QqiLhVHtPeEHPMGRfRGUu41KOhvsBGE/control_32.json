Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating based on certain behaviors, like her acting distracted when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, and the discovery of a box of Magnum condoms. When confronted, the girlfriend claims she was being raped, which shocks the author.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts. The author didn't have direct evidence of cheating but noticed changes in her behavior. The girlfriend's response when confronted is that she was a victim of rape. The author then breaks up with her, feeling that her story doesn't add up because of the context\u2014dressing up and having condoms. The girlfriend feels betrayed and says she revealed something damaging.\n\nLegally and ethically, if someone is being raped, it's a serious matter. However, the situation here is complicated. If the girlfriend was indeed being raped, the author's immediate reaction of confrontation and breakup might not be the best way to handle it. On the other hand, if the accusation is false, the author might be justified in questioning it given the conflicting behaviors.\n\nBut the key point is the author's actions. Did he act in a way that's wrong? He didn't have proof, suspected cheating, and then when confronted with a rape accusation, he reacted emotionally. However, accusing someone of being a liar when they claim to be a victim of rape is very sensitive. Even if the author had doubts, the appropriate response would be to support her and seek help, not to break up immediately. The fact that he kicked her out and ended the relationship without seeking further verification could be seen as dismissive and harmful.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's behavior with the condoms is confusing. But if she was indeed being raped, it's possible she had the condoms for protection, though that's not a common scenario. Alternatively, she might have been trying to avoid pregnancy. The author's assumption that it's for him is flawed, especially since he can't use Magnum condoms. But the presence of condoms in her possession when she's meeting friends adds to the confusion.\n\nIn terms of trust, the author's jealousy and suspicion led him to make a significant accusation. However, when faced with a rape claim, even if he has doubts, the proper approach would be to listen, support, and encourage her to report it. Breaking up immediately without giving her a chance might be unkind and could be seen as the author not taking the accusation seriously.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's handling of the situation is problematic. He didn't validate her trauma, didn't offer support, and ended the relationship in a way that might have been hurtful. Even if he had legitimate concerns, the way he responded could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
