Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the question) is the asshole for thinking his girlfriend wasn't actually getting raped. The situation involves the girlfriend being involved with another guy named Rick, and the author noticing some suspicious behaviors: her acting distracted, getting fancy dressed, tilting her phone away, and then finding condoms in her purse. When confronted, she claims she was being raped but he doesn't believe her and kicked her out.\n\nSo, the key points here are about believing a partner's claim of being a victim of rape. The girlfriend says she's being raped, but the author doesn't believe her and accuses her of cheating. The question is whether the author is wrong for not believing her.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. If someone claims they're being raped, the appropriate response is to believe them and support them. Rape is a serious crime, and it's crucial to take any claims seriously. The author's reaction of not believing her and instead assuming cheating might be harmful and invalidating.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior could be explained in various ways. The fancy clothes and condoms could be for reasons the author doesn't understand. Maybe she's in a coercive situation where she's forced to be with someone, but that doesn't mean it's not rape. The fact that she says she can't leave might be a sign of abuse. The author's immediate dismissal without understanding the context could be the issue here.\n\nAlso, the way he confronted her by taking the condoms and walking into the bathroom might be confrontational and not a supportive response. He should have asked her about the situation calmly and offered support instead of reacting with anger.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's suspicion based on observed behaviors. However, those behaviors could be misinterpreted. Trust in a relationship is important, and his lack of trust led him to not believe her serious claim. The problem is that when someone is a victim of rape, it's not a situation that can be easily proven with evidence, and the survivor's word should be trusted.\n\nThe author's response of ending the relationship immediately might be harsh, but if he doesn't believe her, that's his choice. However, the main issue is whether he is in the wrong for not believing her. Rape is a serious accusation, but the person making the claim is the victim, and the response should be supportive. Dismissing her claim as a lie could lead to further trauma and is not appropriate.\n\nIn terms of the \"am I the asshole\" context, the community often values empathy and believing survivors. The author's actions likely made him the asshole because he didn't support his girlfriend during a traumatic time and instead accused her of lying. Even if he later doubts the truth, his initial reaction was to disbelieve her, which is the wrong approach regardless of the actual circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong because he didn't believe his girlfriend when she claimed to be a victim of rape, which is a serious issue where trust and support are crucial.\n"
