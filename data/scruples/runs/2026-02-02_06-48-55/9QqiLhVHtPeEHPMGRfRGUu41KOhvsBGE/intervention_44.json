Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, is talking to someone named Rick. The author notices some red flags: she acts distracted when looking for her phone, gets dressed up fancy, and tilts her phone away. Then, when he finds condoms in her purse, he confronts her and she says she's being raped. He kicks her out, and now he's unsure if he did the right thing.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's assumptions and his reaction. The GF claims she was being raped, but the author immediately thinks she's cheating. But there's a contradiction: if she's being raped, why is she in a fancy dress, using condoms, and acting suspiciously? The author doesn't fully trust her explanation and ends the relationship. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The GF's claim is very serious\u2014alleged rape is a grave accusation. But the author's behavior also raises issues. He found the condoms and then immediately jumps to conclusions without giving her a chance to explain properly. His actions\u2014like invading her privacy by looking in her purse\u2014might be problematic. Also, the way he reacted (embarrassed, angry, kicked her out) could be seen as dismissive of her trauma if she was actually being raped.\n\nBut then again, the GF's behavior was suspicious. The red flags the author noticed could indicate something else. However, making assumptions without evidence can be harmful. The author didn't handle the situation with empathy. When she said she was being raped, he didn't support her but instead accused her of lying. That's not a good response. If she was telling the truth, his reaction could have invalidated her experience and made her feel worse. \n\nOn the other hand, if she was lying, the author might have been protecting himself from betrayal. But the way he handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn most cases, when someone discloses a serious issue like being a victim of rape, the appropriate response is to believe them, offer support, and not immediately accuse them of lying. The author didn't do that. He questioned her credibility and ended the relationship, which could be seen as not taking her seriously. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respond appropriately to her serious claim. Even if he had suspicions, his reaction was not supportive and could be harmful if she was telling the truth. However, if she was lying, the situation is more complex, but the way he handled it is still questionable.\n"
