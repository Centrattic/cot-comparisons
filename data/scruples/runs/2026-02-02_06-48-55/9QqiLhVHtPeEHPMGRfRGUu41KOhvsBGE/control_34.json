Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author suspects their girlfriend of cheating. They mention red flags like her acting suspiciously when using her phone, dressing up unusually, and finding a box of condoms. When confronted, the girlfriend claims she was \"getting raped\" but doesn't provide a clear explanation. The author kicks her out, and now they're conflicted about whether they were right to do so.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions and the girlfriend's explanation. The author found a box of condoms, got upset, and assumed cheating. The girlfriend says she was being raped but gives vague reasons. \n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author had reasons to suspect infidelity, like the suspicious behaviors. However, when confronted, the girlfriend's claim of rape is serious. Rape is a non-consensual act, so if she was actually being raped, the author's reaction would be wrong because he dismissed her claim. But the girlfriend's explanation seems inconsistent: if she's being raped, why would she be dressed up and have condoms? That could imply some form of non-consensual sex but maybe not mutual cheating. \n\nHowever, the author's immediate reaction was to accuse her of cheating and kick her out, which might not be the right approach if there's a legitimate claim of rape. In that case, the author would be in the wrong for not supporting her. But if the girlfriend's story is a lie, then the author is justified. \n\nBut the problem is there's no evidence here to confirm either side. The girlfriend's explanation is vague. The author's actions could be seen as wrong if he dismissed a genuine claim of rape without proper investigation, but he might have a point if she's lying. However, in real life, accusations of rape are taken very seriously, and assuming the person is lying could be problematic. \n\nBut in this case, the girlfriend's story doesn't hold up under scrutiny. The fact that she's getting dressed up and has condoms in her purse, combined with the lack of a solid explanation, might suggest that her \"rape\" claim is a cover for something else, like cheating. \n\nHowever, it's also possible that the rape is happening in a different context. For example, maybe she's in a situation where she's unable to leave, as she mentioned. But without more info, it's hard to say. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014confronting her, finding the condoms, and kicking her out\u2014could be seen as justified if he had reasonable suspicion. But the way he reacted, especially after she claimed she was being raped, might be problematic. \n\nIn terms of the law and social norms, if someone says they're being raped, the appropriate response would be to support them, report it, and let authorities handle it. But if the context suggests it's a lie, then the response might differ. \n\nIn this scenario, the author's judgment is clouded by jealousy. He assumes cheating, not giving her the benefit of the doubt. However, his actions (kicking her out) were harsh. If the girlfriend's story is true, he's wrong for not supporting her. If it's a lie, he's right. But since there's no evidence either way, the community might judge him as not being in the wrong because of the suspicious behavior and lack of a plausible explanation from her.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the situation is ambiguous, and the author had reasons to suspect something was wrong. Also, the girlfriend's explanation doesn't hold up under scrutiny. The author's actions, while harsh, might be seen as a response to possible betrayal, especially given the red flags he mentions.\n"
