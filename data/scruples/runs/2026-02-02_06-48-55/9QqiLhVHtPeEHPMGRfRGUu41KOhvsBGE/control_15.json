Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The user's girlfriend, let's call her GF, was acting suspiciously. He noticed her being secretive, dressing up unusually, and then found condoms in her purse. When confronted, she claimed she was being raped. The user then kicked her out and is now questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's actions were based on suspicion and finding evidence (condoms) leading him to assume infidelity. However, GF claimed it was a rape. If that's true, then the user's reaction might be inappropriate. But the user also points out contradictions: dressing up and having condoms, which could imply consensual activity. However, the presence of condoms doesn't necessarily mean cheating. Maybe GF was taking precautions for a consensual but secret relationship, or maybe she was in a situation where she felt forced but still needed protection. \n\nBut the key point here is the user's assumption. He didn't verify her claim before reacting. He took the condoms as a sign of cheating, which is a common assumption but not always accurate. When GF revealed the rape, he didn't pause to consider the possibility, instead reacting with anger and disbelief. That's a problem. If someone discloses a rape, the appropriate response is support, not immediate judgment. The user's reaction of humiliation and anger, and then kicking her out, could be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if there were inconsistencies, his response was not supportive.\n\nHowever, the user is also in a vulnerable position. He found evidence that he interpreted as cheating, which is a valid reason for conflict. The issue is how he handled the disclosure of rape. If GF was indeed being raped, his reaction could be seen as dismissive. But if she made up the rape claim to avoid cheating accusations, then the user was right to be concerned. But since we don't have evidence, we have to base it on the actions and responses.\n\nThe user's immediate reaction to the rape claim was disbelief and anger, which is problematic. He should have listened more, provided support, and maybe sought help for her instead of ending the relationship. Even if he suspected deceit, the way he handled it could be considered inconsiderate. So, the user is partially in the wrong for not believing her, especially after she revealed something as serious as rape. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
