Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a boyfriend who found a box of Magnum condoms in his girlfriend's purse while she was about to meet her friends. He took this as a sign she was cheating. Then, when confronted, she claimed she was being raped. The author felt lied to, kicked her out, and is now questioning if he was right to do so.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's actions of searching through her purse (which might be a privacy issue), his assumptions based on finding condoms, and his reaction to her claim of being raped. \n\nStarting with privacy. The boyfriend found the condoms while looking for Advil. She had a purse, and he reached in. Depending on their agreement, this might be an issue. If they had an understanding that they wouldn't look through each other's belongings, then he violated that. But if it's a shared space and he's looking for something he needs, maybe it's not as clear-cut. But even so, taking her phone or searching through her things without permission can be a problem. \n\nThen, the assumption. He found Magnum condoms and immediately thought she was cheating. But Magnum condoms are a brand, not necessarily a size indicator. Maybe she just prefers them. The author's reasoning here is flawed because he made an assumption without evidence. That's a red flag for jealousy without proof.\n\nWhen confronted, she claims she's being raped. The author's reaction is to dismiss her claim, call her a liar, and end the relationship. This is where it gets complicated. If she was actually being raped, his reaction could be seen as dismissive and harmful. But if she made up the rape claim to justify cheating, then the author is justified in ending the relationship. However, the author didn't take the time to verify her claim or listen properly. He just reacted in anger, which might be the issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior: entering rooms to find her phone, acting distracted, getting dressed up unusually, tilting her phone away. These could be signs of secrecy, but they could also have innocent explanations. The author shouldn't jump to conclusions without talking to her first. Instead, he assumed the worst.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author should have addressed his concerns openly and without accusations instead of making assumptions and taking extreme actions. His immediate reaction to kick her out and call her a liar without understanding her side is problematic.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is serious. If it's true, the author's response was wrong. If it's a lie, then she's the one at fault. But the author didn't handle the situation correctly regardless. He should have taken it seriously and sought evidence or support rather than just believing the worst.\n\nIn terms of the author being wrong, he violated her privacy, made unfounded accusations, and dismissed her serious claim without proper investigation. His actions were impulsive and not based on facts. Therefore, he's not in the right.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of his own assumptions. He took the condoms as proof of cheating, which is a flawed premise. His trust in his girlfriend was broken without proper cause. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he acted on assumptions, invaded her privacy, and didn't handle the situation with care or open communication.\n"
