Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then she told him she was getting raped. He didn't believe her and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors\u2014like her being distracted when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, and tilting her phone away. Then he found the condoms, which he realized weren't for him because they were Magnum brand. This led him to confront her, and she said she was being raped. He didn't believe her and kicked her out.\n\nNow, the key question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, accusing someone of infidelity can be really hurtful. But in this case, the girlfriend claimed she was being raped, which is a serious allegation. However, the author's reasoning is that if she's getting dolled up and has condoms, it's not consensual. But wait, if someone is being forced into a sexual act, they might not have the agency to refuse, so having condoms could be a precaution for her own protection, like preventing pregnancy. Dressing up might be part of the abuser's control or something she's been forced into. Also, the girlfriend mentioned that she couldn't leave, which is a common situation in abusive relationships where the victim feels trapped.\n\nThe author's actions here are based on suspicion and not trusting her explanation. However, when she claims to be a victim of rape, the appropriate response would be to support her, not immediately assume she's lying. The author's reaction of anger and not believing her could be seen as invalidating her trauma. Even if there are red flags, those don't necessarily confirm the truth of her statement. The author's response of ending the relationship without seeking more information or support might be hasty.\n\nBut then again, the author is also dealing with betrayal and hurt. Finding condoms in her purse suggests something is off. However, the girlfriend's explanation is a serious one, and the author dismissing it outright could be problematic. The author's reaction might be influenced by his own insecurities or not trusting her, but in a situation involving potential rape, it's crucial to believe the victim unless there's concrete evidence to the contrary.\n\nIn terms of societal context, there's a strong emphasis on believing survivors of sexual assault. The author's disbelief might be seen as contributing to the problem, as victims often face skepticism. However, the girlfriend's behavior and the presence of the condoms might have created a conflict in the author's mind. But it's important to note that victims of rape don't always behave in expected ways. They might act in ways that don't align with the observer's expectations due to trauma or manipulation.\n\nSo, weighing these points, the author's immediate dismissal of her rape claim without thorough investigation or support could be considered wrong. The correct approach would be to believe her, support her, and encourage her to seek help, rather than reacting with anger and ending the relationship abruptly. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
