Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, and there are a lot of factors to consider.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the author's reaction to finding condoms in his girlfriend's purse. He assumed she was cheating, but she claims she was being raped. The key question is whether his initial assumption and subsequent actions were justified.\n\nLooking at the context provided, the author noticed some red flags: the girlfriend was being secretive about her phone, dressing up unusually, and acting distracted. These behaviors could be signs of something wrong, but they can also be explained in other ways. The discovery of condoms led him to confront her, and her response was that she was being raped. \n\nNow, when someone says they're being raped, that's a serious accusation. The author's reaction was to kick her out and cut off contact. But he didn't give her a chance to explain further. The girlfriend's explanation was that it's a side effect of being abused and not being able to leave, which is a known dynamic in abusive situations where victims might not be able to act in ways others expect. The fact that she was dressing up and had condoms might seem contradictory to someone unfamiliar with the nuances of abuse. \n\nHowever, the author's immediate assumption that she was lying and his decision to end the relationship abruptly without seeking more information or support could be problematic. He didn't consider that she might be in a traumatic situation or that her behavior was a result of being manipulated or controlled. Also, he didn't give her a chance to explain her side properly, which is important in such sensitive situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's trust was violated, and the behavior he observed was concerning. But his approach was confrontational and led to her being kicked out. The situation is further complicated by the use of a specific brand of condoms that the author couldn't use, which might have added to his immediate assumption of infidelity. However, that doesn't justify his reaction without further investigation.\n\nIn domestic situations involving accusations of abuse, it's crucial to handle things with care and seek professional help. The author might have acted out of hurt and betrayal, but responding without understanding the full context could have been harmful, especially if the girlfriend was indeed in an abusive situation. The fact that she was crying and felt the situation was damaging to her suggests that there's more to her story that he didn't consider.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions\u2014assuming guilt without thorough investigation, reacting with anger, and cutting off contact immediately\u2014could be seen as hasty and not taking her potential trauma into account. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more empathy and seeking to understand rather than reacting impulsively.\n"
