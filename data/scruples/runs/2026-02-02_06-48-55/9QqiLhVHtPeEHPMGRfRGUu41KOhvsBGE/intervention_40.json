Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who found condoms in his girlfriend's purse and assumed she was cheating. Then she told him she was being raped. He kicked her out but now is unsure if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The man found condoms in her purse. He immediately assumed she was cheating, which led to a big argument. She claimed she was being raped, which he didn't believe. He acted on his suspicion by ending the relationship.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, when someone says they're being raped, that's a serious accusation. But the guy had suspicions based on her behavior before finding the condoms. However, his reaction\u2014immediately not believing her and ending the relationship\u2014might be problematic. On the other hand, she had the condoms, which could be for protection during non-consensual acts, but that's rare. Typically, condoms are used consensually. So maybe he's right to be suspicious? But then, if she was actually being raped, his reaction could be dismissing her trauma.\n\nBut the problem is that the situation is not clear. She didn't provide evidence for the rape claim, and he had reasons to doubt her (like the fancy dresses and hiding her phone). However, when someone says they're being raped, it's a serious matter. Assuming she's lying might not be the right approach. But he also has a right to be upset if he felt cheated.\n\nSo, in AITA terms, people often look for whether the person overreacted or acted without enough evidence. The author didn't give her a chance to explain beyond her initial claim. She said she was being raped, and he dismissed it, which could be seen as not taking her seriously. That's a problem because if she was actually in a vulnerable situation, he should have supported her instead of kicking her out. \n\nBut then again, he had the condoms, which are usually for consensual sex. So his suspicion is understandable. The issue is how he handled it. Instead of listening and seeking more information, he jumped to conclusions and ended the relationship. That's where he might be wrong. The right approach would be to believe her, support her, and help her get help, regardless of his suspicions. So the author is in the wrong because he dismissed her serious claim without proper investigation and reacted impulsively.\n"
