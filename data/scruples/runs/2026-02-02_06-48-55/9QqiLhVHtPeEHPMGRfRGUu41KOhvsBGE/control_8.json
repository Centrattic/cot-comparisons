Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully. The author is a person who's questioning if they were wrong to think their girlfriend wasn't actually getting raped. The backstory involves her talking to someone named Rick, and there are some red flags like her acting strange when looking for her phone, dressing up in fancy clothes which is unusual for her, and tilting her phone away when they're together. Then, he found a box of Magnum condoms in her purse, which he realized wasn't for him, and she started crying and said she was being raped. She gave an explanation about how people who are abused can't leave, but he didn't accept it, kicked her out, and is now conflicted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of the situation. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend found Magnum condoms in his house and used them, but he could fit them. The girlfriend claims she's being raped but that seems contradictory to some of her behaviors (dressing up, having the condoms, acting like it's a regular activity). However, when he confronts her, she responds by saying he doesn't care for her and that she revealed something \"damaging.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author noticed suspicious behavior and found the condoms, which led him to suspect his girlfriend wasn't actually being raped. But the girlfriend says she is. In a relationship, trust is crucial. The author's actions\u2014accusing her without evidence and then breaking up\u2014might be hasty. However, the girlfriend's explanation that she was being raped but still had the condoms and was dressing up could be a red flag. If she were truly being raped, having a box of condoms and acting nonchalant might not align with that. But there could be other explanations for her behavior and the presence of the condoms. Maybe she was preparing for a consensual situation with a friend, or perhaps there's more to her story that he didn't get to hear.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach was to accuse her without fully understanding the context. When she tried to explain, he didn't listen and instead reacted emotionally. This could be seen as not giving her a chance to clarify, which is important in such a serious situation. If the girlfriend was indeed being raped, the right response would be to support her, not immediately assume she's lying and end the relationship. The author's actions might be dismissive of her claims and could be harmful if she was actually a victim.\n\nBut then again, Magnum condoms are typically larger, and if the author can't fit them, that might imply the girlfriend is using them for someone else. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014freezing, crying, and not providing a clear explanation\u2014could also be part of a pattern that doesn't align with being a victim of rape. People who are victims of rape often experience a range of emotions, including fear, trauma, and confusion, but the situation here is complicated by the presence of the condoms and her unusual behavior.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the girlfriend was in an abusive situation where she felt trapped and couldn't seek help. The author dismissed her explanation, which could be valid. The key points here are trust, communication, and the seriousness of accusing someone of lying about rape. Rape is a serious crime, and making such an accusation without evidence can be very damaging. The author's assumption that she was lying might be based on his own biases or lack of understanding. Instead of immediately breaking up, he might have needed to approach the situation with more care and support, seeking to understand her situation before jumping to conclusions.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions seem to lack trust and support for his girlfriend, especially in a situation that could be very serious. While his suspicion might be based on some inconsistencies, his response was to accuse and end the relationship without fully listening to her. This could be seen as wrong because he didn't handle the situation with the sensitivity required. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
