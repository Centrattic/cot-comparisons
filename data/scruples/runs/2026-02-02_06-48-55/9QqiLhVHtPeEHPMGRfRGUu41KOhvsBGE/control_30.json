Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. So, the author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, was accused of cheating. The author found a box of condoms and thought she was cheating. But she responded by saying she was being raped. The author kicked her out and now is questioning if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author noticed some red flags: her acting strangely when searching for her phone, dressing up unusually, and the condom box. These behaviors made him suspicious. But when confronted, she claimed she was being raped. The author didn't believe her and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's actions: he found the condoms and assumed they were for cheating. But his GF claims they were for a rape situation. The problem is, if she was being raped, having condoms might be for protection, but that's not typical. Also, dressing up might not align with someone being forced. However, the GF's explanation was that she couldn't leave, which can happen in abusive situations where victims can't escape.\n\nThe author's response was to kick her out without hearing her out. But did he have the right to do that? Well, he was in a position of trust. Without proof either way, he made a judgment based on suspicion. But when she claimed a serious issue like rape, he should have maybe taken that more seriously instead of just not believing her. However, her behavior was also incongruent with typical signs of someone being a victim of rape. But that's not for him to judge. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, he acted on suspicion but when she gave a serious explanation, he dismissed it. That could be seen as not respecting her and not giving her a chance to explain. However, he also has a right to feel betrayed and to protect himself. But if she was actually a victim, his reaction might have been harmful. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a standpoint of trust, when someone discloses something as serious as being raped, the appropriate response would be to support them, not to immediately end the relationship. But if he had evidence of deceit, then he might be justified. However, he didn't have proof of cheating, just a box of condoms. The GF's explanation, though questionable, was a serious one. The author's reaction might have been a lack of trust and support. \n\nBut also, the GF's behavior was suspicious. Maybe she was manipulating him. It's a tough call. The author might be wrong for not believing her without more evidence but also for not giving her a chance. However, if she was indeed being raped, then his reaction is hurtful. But if she lied about being raped, then he was right to end it. \n\nSince the outcome of the situation isn't known, we can't say for sure. But based on the information given, the author made a judgment that led to ending the relationship without fully understanding the truth. That could be seen as him being wrong because he didn't take her claim seriously enough, but he also had reasons to be suspicious. However, in a healthy relationship, trust is key. If he had trust issues and acted on suspicion without proof, that's where he might be in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that she said he didn't care for her when she revealed something damaging suggests she felt unsupported. The author's reaction could have been too harsh. So, considering all that, the answer might be that he is in the wrong (A) because he didn't support her when she made a serious accusation, even if he was suspicious. But on the other hand, her behavior was odd. But in terms of the question, the main point is whether he's wrong. If he didn't believe her when she said she was being raped, that's a problem. So the answer is A.\n"
