Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, leading to a confrontation where she claims she was being raped.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author noticed his girlfriend acting strangely\u2014searching for her phone, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away. Then he found condoms in her purse, which led to a confrontation. She responded by saying she was being raped. The author then kicked her out, and she accused him of not caring.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong? The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author acted on suspicion without evidence. He found condoms and immediately assumed cheating, which might be a hasty conclusion. However, when confronted with what seemed like a contradictory statement (being raped while dressed up and having condoms), he didn't accept her explanation. \n\nBut wait, if she was indeed being raped, then the presence of condoms might be for protection, and her dressing up could be a red herring. However, the author's reaction was to kick her out without seeking further verification. \n\nBut here's the thing: rape is a serious accusation. If the girlfriend was being raped, the author's immediate reaction of not believing her could be harmful. However, the situation is complex. The girlfriend's behavior might have been suspicious, and the author might have had reasons to doubt her explanation given the circumstances. \n\nHowever, in a healthy relationship, trust is key. The author's actions\u2014invading privacy by going through her purse and then reacting harshly\u2014might indicate a lack of trust without proper cause. On the other hand, if the girlfriend was lying about being raped to avoid consequences, that's a different issue. But the author's immediate dismissal of her explanation (calling her a liar) could be the problem here.\n\nThe key factors are: Did the author have a right to invade her privacy? How did he handle the confrontation? And was his reaction proportionate? \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the author didn't have prior evidence of infidelity, his actions might be seen as overstepping. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious matter that should be taken seriously. The author's anger and refusal to listen might prevent her from getting help if it's true. \n\nBut if the girlfriend was indeed lying and using the rape accusation to manipulate or deflect, that's a different scenario. However, the author's role here is complicated. He might not be in the wrong for suspecting something's off, but his handling of the situation\u2014especially the confrontation and lack of willingness to seek third-party verification\u2014could be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might have been driven by suspicion and mistrust, leading to a harsh reaction without considering the gravity of the accusation. His immediate dismissal of her claim without giving her a chance to explain properly could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more care and empathy.\n"
