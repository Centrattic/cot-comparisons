Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and assumed she was cheating, only to find out she claims she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, was acting suspiciously\u2014searching for her phone frantically, dressing up more than usual, and hiding her phone. These red flags led the author to find the condoms. When confronted, she said she was being raped. The author's reaction was to kick her out, feeling betrayed and angry. The GF claims she was being raped, but the author is suspicious because the behavior (dressing up, having condoms) seems inconsistent with non-consensual activity.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author's assumption that she was cheating without concrete evidence, then reacting harshly when she presents an alternative explanation. The GF's claim of being raped is a serious accusation, but the author dismissed it, leading to the breakup. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's immediate reaction to find the condoms and kick her out might be seen as hasty. He didn't give her a chance to explain further, even though she provided an explanation (though it seems a bit vague). However, his suspicion was based on observed behaviors, and he felt he had a right to know the truth. On the other hand, if the GF was indeed being raped, the author's reaction could be seen as invalidating her trauma. But the GF's story doesn't fully add up with her actions (why have condoms if she's being raped?), which the author is pointing out as a contradiction.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the GF was lying about the rape to avoid being blamed for cheating, then the author's reaction was based on a misunderstanding. However, if she was genuinely being raped, his reaction could be seen as cruel. But the author is also reacting to what he perceives as deceit, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's complicated. The author might not be in the wrong because he acted on his suspicions based on the evidence he found, even if he misinterpreted it. However, his approach (confronting her abruptly, kicking her out without a thorough discussion) might be seen as harsh. The problem is that the story is from the author's perspective, and we don't know the full truth. If the GF's story is a lie, he was justified in breaking up. If she's truthful, then he was wrong to doubt her. Since we don't have the full context, but the author's actions are based on his interpretation of events, it's possible he's not in the wrong, given the ambiguity. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust in a relationship. The author's behavior (checking her phone, assuming the worst) might have contributed to the situation. Still, the main issue is his reaction to the condoms and her explanation. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he acted on his perception of betrayal, even if his conclusion was incorrect. The alternative is that he should have trusted her explanation, but given the contradictions he points out, it's a gray area. Given the information provided, the answer is B.\n"
