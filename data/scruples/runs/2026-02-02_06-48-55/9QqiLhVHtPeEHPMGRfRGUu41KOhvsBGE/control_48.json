Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The author is a guy who found condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then she told him she was being raped. He didn't believe her, accused her of cheating, and broke up with her. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had red flags: the girlfriend was acting suspicious, searching for her phone, dressing up more than usual, and hiding her phone. Then he found the condoms, which he knew weren't for him. He confronted her, and she said she was being raped. He didn't believe her, kicked her out, and now he's conflicted.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions stem from suspicion and maybe jealousy. Finding condoms and the way his girlfriend was acting could lead someone to think she's cheating. But on the other hand, the girlfriend claimed she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. The author dismissed her immediately without giving her a chance to explain further. \n\nThe key points here are trust and belief in a relationship. When someone says they're being raped, the immediate reaction shouldn't be to accuse them of lying unless there's clear evidence. However, the author did have some behaviors that could be seen as suspicious. But the line between suspicion and actual infidelity is thin. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's explanation about being abused and \"can't leave\" is a real thing\u2014some people in abusive situations can't leave immediately. But the author didn't seem to accept that and instead assumed the worst. \n\nThe problem is that the author didn't give her the benefit of the doubt. Even if he had doubts, the right approach would be to support her if she was being raped. But since he reacted with anger and broke up, it's possible he was wrong to dismiss her claim so quickly. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust. If the girlfriend was acting suspicious and had the condoms, maybe there's some truth to the author's suspicion. However, the way he handled it was poor. Instead of calmly discussing it, he made an accusation and ended the relationship. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether believing the girlfriend's rape claim is necessary. If the author is supposed to believe her even without proof, then he's in the wrong. But if there's reasonable doubt based on the circumstances, maybe he's not. \n\nBut in reality, making an immediate judgment and breaking up over a claim of rape without any evidence is harsh. Even if he had suspicions, the proper response would be to support her and seek help. So the author probably is in the wrong for not believing her and handling it poorly. However, the girlfriend's behavior might have justified some suspicion, but the key is that she made a serious claim that should be taken seriously.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A) Yes, the author is in the wrong because he dismissed a serious claim without support and reacted impulsively.\n"
