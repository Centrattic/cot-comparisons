Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"Am I the asshole?\" post) is in the wrong here. The situation involves their girlfriend, who they suspect is cheating because of some behaviors like acting strangely around her phone, dressing up more, and having condoms in her purse. When confronted, the girlfriend claims she was being raped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical implications here. Accusing someone of lying about being raped is a serious matter because it's a criminal offense. If the author called the police or made false accusations, that would definitely be wrong. However, in this case, the author didn't call the police. They just ended the relationship after finding the condoms and being told about the rape. \n\nBut the key issue here is whether the author acted appropriately when they got the explanation. The girlfriend said she was being raped, which is a severe claim. Even if there are red flags, the author should have taken that claim seriously and not dismissed it outright. Instead of kicking her out immediately, they should have tried to verify the situation or encouraged her to seek help from authorities or support services. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014like searching through her purse without consent\u2014could be seen as a violation of privacy. Even if they had suspicions, invading someone's privacy can be problematic. However, the fact that they found condoms might be seen as a reason for their concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's explanation about being raped without a clear follow-up is suspicious. If she was truly a victim, she might have reported the rape or sought help. But the author didn't give her a chance to explain further, and instead reacted emotionally. \n\nIn terms of trust and communication, the author should have addressed the issue with more care. Accusing someone of cheating without evidence can be hurtful, but dismissing a claim of rape is also wrong. The author's anger and immediate decision to end the relationship might indicate a lack of empathy or willingness to listen.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's mistake was not taking the girlfriend's claim of rape seriously and reacting in a way that could be seen as dismissive or accusatory without proper investigation. Even if there were suspicions, the appropriate response would be to support the victim and encourage them to report the crime, rather than making assumptions and breaking up immediately. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not taking the rape claim seriously, even if the girlfriend was being dishonest.\n"
