Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend was seen acting suspiciously\u2014looking for her phone frantically, dressing up more than usual, and having condoms in her purse. When he found the condoms, she claimed she was being raped. He reacted by kicking her out, and now he's unsure if he was right to do so.\n\nSo, the main question is whether his reaction was justified. On one side, he noticed several red flags and had a valid reason to be concerned. The condoms being Magnum brand, which he couldn't use, suggests they might be for someone else. His actions of confronting her after finding the condoms led her to claim she was being raped. \n\nBut then, when she says she was being raped, that's a serious accusation. The author dismissed it, which could be seen as not taking her seriously. However, her behavior seems inconsistent with being a victim of rape\u2014dressing up, having condoms, and the way she reacted when confronted. \n\nThe key points here are: Did he violate her privacy by checking her purse? Well, he was looking for Advil, so maybe not. But was he right to assume she was cheating based on the condoms? Maybe not, but the red flags were there. When she claimed she was being raped, he was skeptical, which might be understandable given the circumstances, but he didn't give her a chance to explain fully. \n\nHowever, accusing someone of cheating and then dismissing their claim of being raped is a serious matter. Even if there were inconsistencies, the author's immediate reaction was to kick her out without fully listening. That might not have been the best approach. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If she was actually being raped, then he was wrong to not believe her. However, if she was lying about the rape to avoid being blamed for cheating, then he wasn't in the wrong. \n\nThe problem here is that we don't have all the facts. The author is the one making the post, so we have to take his side. But in terms of his actions: finding the condoms, confronting her, and then reacting when she claims rape. \n\nIf he didn't give her a chance to explain the rape story properly, maybe he was in the wrong. But if her story didn't add up, perhaps he had a reason to be skeptical. \n\nThe answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't believe her when she claimed to be a victim, even though she was crying and said it was damaging. But his actions were based on prior red flags. It's a tough call. \n\nAlternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) because the suspicious behavior and the context of the condoms led him to a reasonable suspicion. However, the way he reacted without fully understanding her side could be a problem. \n\nI think the key here is that believing a partner's claim of being raped is important, even if there are inconsistencies. The author's initial judgment might have been based on jealousy or not fully considering her explanation. So he might be in the wrong for not believing her until he heard her out.\n"
