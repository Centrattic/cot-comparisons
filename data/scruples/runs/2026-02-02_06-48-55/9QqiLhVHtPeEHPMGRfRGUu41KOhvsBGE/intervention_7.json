Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend being accused of cheating, but she claims she was being raped. The author found condoms in her purse and confronted her, leading to her saying she was being raped. He kicked her out and is now questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author noticed several red flags: her acting strangely around her phone, dressing up unusually, and the discovery of condoms. When confronted, she claimed she was being raped. The author's reaction was anger and disbelief, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend's claim of being raped versus the author's suspicion of cheating. The author's actions\u2014finding the condoms, confronting her, and then kicking her out\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially if her claim was true. But there's also the question of whether the author's assumptions were valid. If she was actually being raped, then the author's reaction might be inappropriate because he didn't believe her. However, if her story was a lie to cover up cheating, then the author might be justified in his reaction.\n\nThe problem is that the situation isn't clear. The girlfriend's behavior does raise questions. The fact that she was dressing up and had condoms could be part of a consensual relationship, not rape. Rape is non-consensual by definition, so if she was being forced, why the fancy dress and condoms? That doesn't align with a forced scenario. However, there are cases where abuse victims might not immediately leave or might act in ways that seem contradictory for various reasons (e.g., manipulation by the abuser, fear, etc.).\n\nThe author's immediate reaction was to assume cheating, which might be a problem. He didn't support her and instead reacted with anger, which could be seen as not believing her. But if her story doesn't fit the typical signs of rape, maybe the author is right to be skeptical. However, it's also possible that she was in an abusive situation where she felt trapped. But the presence of condoms complicates that narrative. If she was being forced, she wouldn't need to use condoms unless it was a form of control by the abuser, which is possible but not common.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, he didn't give her a chance to explain fully before kicking her out. If she was genuinely in danger, his response might have been dismissive. On the other hand, if she was lying, then his reaction was justified. The problem is that we don't have enough information to know the truth.\n\nIn these cases, the general advice is to believe someone when they say they're being raped, but the situation here has conflicting elements. The author's skepticism might be valid because the evidence doesn't clearly support a rape scenario. However, the way he handled it\u2014confrontation and immediate breakup\u2014might be too harsh if there was any truth to her claim.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting her if she was truly being victimized. But the presence of condoms and her behavior raises questions. The answer is tricky. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for his reaction. If the girlfriend was lying, then the author isn't in the wrong. If she was telling the truth, then he is. But since we don't know, the focus should be on his response. He didn't validate her claim, instead accused her of lying, which is problematic if she was genuinely in need of help. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting her and breaking up immediately without a proper discussion.\n"
