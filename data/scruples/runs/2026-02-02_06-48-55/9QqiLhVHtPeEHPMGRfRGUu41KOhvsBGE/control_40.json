Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend had a box of condoms, which he found suspicious, and she claimed she was being raped. He then kicked her out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author mentions several red flags: her acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up fancy, tilting her phone away, and then finding condoms. When confronted, she said she was being raped. The author is questioning her story because he doesn't believe that someone would be dressed up and have condoms if they were being raped. \n\nBut wait, there's a big issue here. If she was truly being raped, that's a serious situation. The author reacted by not believing her and ending the relationship. Is that wrong? On one hand, he has a right to be concerned about his partner's fidelity. On the other hand, if she was telling the truth about being raped, his reaction might be dismissing her trauma and invalidating her experience.\n\nBut the problem is that the author immediately assumed she was cheating based on the condoms, which can have other explanations. However, he also didn't give her a chance to explain further. The girlfriend's response of claiming rape could be a defense mechanism, but it's a serious accusation. The author's reaction is harsh\u2014he accuses her of lying and ends the relationship without seeking more information.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. If someone is being raped, they might not necessarily have condoms, but the author is conflating infidelity with rape, which are two different issues. The girlfriend's claim of rape might be a way to deflect from cheating, but it's also possible she's genuinely in danger. The author's immediate disbelief and harsh reaction could be wrong because he's not considering her potential trauma. \n\nHowever, the author is in a position where he's confused and hurt. The girlfriend didn't provide a credible explanation. The key question is whether he's in the wrong for not believing her. If she was lying about rape, then his reaction might be justified. But if she was telling the truth, then he's dismissing her and not supporting her. But the problem is, we don't know the whole story. \n\nIn terms of AITA rules, usually, the person who makes a serious accusation without evidence can be considered wrong. But in this case, the author is the one who found evidence (condoms) and then had a reaction. However, the girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious accusation. The author might be in the wrong if he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt and reacting with anger instead of empathy. Or maybe he's not in the wrong because he's protecting himself from being cheated on.\n\nBut there's another angle: the girlfriend's behavior was suspicious, and her claim of rape seems inconsistent with the context (dressing up, condoms). The author's reaction could be based on valid concerns. However, accusing someone of lying about rape is a serious matter. \n\nIn many AITA cases, if someone accuses their partner of cheating and then the partner responds with an outlandish accusation (like rape), the one making the accusation is often seen as the asshole. But here, the author is the one who found the condoms and then the girlfriend claimed rape. If she's lying, the author is justified in ending the relationship. But if she's telling the truth, then the author is the asshole for not supporting her. \n\nBut the story is from the author's perspective. He presents his side, and there's no evidence that she's actually being raped. The community often looks at both sides, but since we only have the author's perspective, the judgment is tricky. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author is wrong for not believing her. If the girlfriend made a false rape claim to deflect, then the author is justified. If she's telling the truth, then he's wrong. However, in AITA, if someone makes a false accusation, they're usually seen as the asshole. But in this case, the author's own actions (finding condoms) led to the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction was harsh, but his suspicion was based on concrete evidence (condoms). However, the girlfriend's claim of rape is a serious accusation. The author is in a difficult position, but the fact that he didn't believe her and ended the relationship without further investigation might make him the asshole. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was lying, he's not wrong. But since we don't know, the answer depends on the community's stance. In many AITA scenarios, if someone makes a false accusation, they're the asshole, but if the person is wrongfully accused, then the accuser is the asshole. But here, the roles are reversed. The author is the one who found evidence, and the girlfriend made the false accusation. So, in that case, the author is not in the wrong because he's the one who has the evidence, and her accusation is false. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But there's a chance the author is being too quick to judge. But the key is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the information, the author is reacting to what he found and the girlfriend's response is a serious accusation that might be a lie. So the author is not in the wrong for not believing her and ending the relationship. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
