Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who claims she was being raped, but the author is skeptical because of some behaviors like getting fancied up, hiding her phone, and finding condoms. The author ended the relationship, and now is questioning if they were wrong to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend told him she was being raped. That's a serious allegation. The author's response was to kick her out after finding the condoms. He felt she was lying because of the other behaviors. But how does that hold up?\n\nWell, if someone is in an abusive or coercive situation, they might act in ways that seem contradictory. For example, getting dressed up could be part of the abuser's demands, not the victim's choice. The victim might not have control over their actions. Also, hiding the phone could be to avoid the abuser tracking them, not to hide infidelity. The condoms being Magnum size might be for the abuser's preference, not the victim's. The author's assumption that she's cheating because of the condom size shows a lack of understanding of how abuse works. \n\nThe author's immediate reaction to the accusation of rape is to confront and end the relationship. Accusing someone of lying about being raped is serious. If the girlfriend was telling the truth, the author's response could be invalidating her trauma. Even if there are red flags, the right approach is to support her rather than dismiss her claims. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction of freezing and crying might indicate distress, not deceit. The author's assumption that her behavior (like getting dolled up) disproves the rape is flawed. Victims can be manipulated into certain actions, and their actions don't necessarily align with what we expect. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a position where he's dealing with trust issues. The behaviors he noticed were suspicious, but his conclusion that she's lying without proper investigation is problematic. He should have listened to her explanation before making a judgment, especially given the gravity of the situation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he dismissed her claims of rape without understanding the context of abuse. His actions led to ending the relationship, which could be seen as not supporting her during a traumatic time. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation with the sensitivity it requires.\n"
