Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and assumed she was cheating. But she claims she was being raped. He didn't believe her and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's actions: he noticed some behaviors that he found suspicious, like her acting distracted when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, and tilting her phone away. Then he found the condoms, which led him to accuse her of cheating. But she said it was a rape situation. He didn't believe her explanation and kicked her out.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side: she says she was being raped. If that's true, then the author's reaction is based on a misunderstanding. However, her behavior (dressing up, having condoms) might seem contradictory to someone who's a victim of rape. But wait, victims of sexual assault might not act in ways that align with societal expectations. For example, someone in an abusive situation might have to dress a certain way to go out, or the perpetrator might force them into situations where they have to carry items like condoms. Also, the fact that she was with her \"girlfriends\" could be a red herring if the real situation is more complicated.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author had a reasonable basis to suspect cheating versus whether the girlfriend's claim of being raped is valid. The author acted on his suspicions without verifying the facts. He found the condoms and immediately jumped to the conclusion of cheating, not considering other possibilities. His reaction was to confront her and end the relationship, which could be seen as harsh if her claim was genuine. However, if her story was fabricated, then he might have been right to be suspicious.\n\nBut the problem is that the girlfriend didn't provide a clear explanation, just mentioned something about being abused. The author might not have had enough information to know for sure. However, the way he handled it\u2014grabbing the box, going to the bathroom, and then kicking her out without listening to her explanation\u2014could be seen as dismissive. He didn't give her a chance to explain properly before making a judgment. Also, believing a partner's claim of being a rape victim is important because false accusations are rare and taking such an accusation seriously is the right approach. If he didn't believe her without evidence, that's a problem.\n\nSo, in terms of the question: Is he the asshole? If the girlfriend was telling the truth, then the author is wrong for not believing her and ending the relationship. If she was lying, then he's justified. But since we don't know the truth, we have to consider the scenario. The subreddit often looks at intent and actions. The author didn't investigate further, didn't give her a chance to explain, and acted on suspicion without evidence. That's where he might be at fault. Also, the fact that she was in distress and he reacted with anger might compound the issue. Additionally, the author's own behavior, like being possessive and not respecting her phone privacy, could be seen as contributing to the problem.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who makes assumptions without evidence and reacts harshly is considered the asshole. So here, the author's immediate assumption of cheating without considering her explanation might make him the asshole, especially if her claim of being raped is genuine. Even if she was lying, the way he handled it could still be problematic. But the subreddit might lean towards B (not in the wrong) if they think his suspicions were based on valid reasons. However, given the seriousness of the accusation (rape), not believing her could be seen as wrong. The answer might depend on whether the author acted in bad faith. The girlfriend's behavior was unusual, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's lying. The author should have approached the situation with more empathy and sought more information before making a judgment.\n"
