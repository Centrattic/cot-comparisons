Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and assumed she was cheating. But when he confronted her, she said she was being raped. He then ended the relationship because he didn't believe her, and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his actions. He went through her purse without her consent, found the condoms, and then reacted by kicking her out. On the other hand, she claimed she was being raped, which is a very serious accusation. His initial assumption was that she was cheating, but her response was that it was non-consensual, which is a significant difference.\n\nThe key points here are consent and belief. If she was actually being raped, then his immediate reaction of not believing her could be problematic. However, the story has a lot of red flags from his perspective. He noticed her acting strangely, like hiding her phone, dressing up in a way that's unusual for her, and other suspicious behaviors. Then when he found the condoms, he assumed the worst. But when she said it was non-consensual, he dismissed it by saying \"are you trying to get me to think you're stupid?\"\n\nBut wait, if she was being raped, then she might be in a traumatic situation where she can't just leave. The fact that she was meeting with friends, using condoms, and dressing up might not align with someone who is being forced. However, there's also the possibility that she's in an abusive situation where she's being coerced into having sex, hence the condoms. But if she's the one providing the condoms, that might imply some level of control or planning, which complicates the situation.\n\nThe author's reaction to her claim of rape is important. If he immediately dismissed her without giving her a chance to explain further, that could be wrong. However, there's also the aspect of his trust being broken because of the red flags he observed. The problem is that he didn't give her a chance to explain the situation more thoroughly before making a judgment. Instead, he reacted emotionally, leading to the breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, if she was lying about being raped, then the author might have been wrong to end the relationship without more evidence. But if she was actually being raped, his not believing her could be a serious issue. The situation is complicated because both sides have valid points, but the key here is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nThe article mentions that she \"froze\" when he showed her the condoms, which could indicate guilt or fear. But the author didn't take the time to listen to her explanation calmly. He reacted with anger and disbelief, which might have led him to make a hasty decision. However, the initial red flags he noticed might have been legitimate reasons for suspicion.\n\nIn terms of consent and trust in a relationship, the author's actions of invading her privacy by going through her purse could also be problematic. Even if he had concerns, the way he handled it was confrontational and potentially damaging. The question is whether his assumption about her infidelity was justified given the context. If she was actually a victim of rape, then his not believing her could be a major issue. But if she was lying, then he was protecting himself from a betrayal.\n\nIt's a tricky situation because there's not enough information to know the truth. However, the author's immediate dismissal of her claim of rape without giving her a chance to explain further, despite the serious nature of the accusation, might make him the asshole. On the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior was suspicious, and the author had reasons to be concerned. The answer probably depends on whether the author should have believed her claim of rape despite the inconsistencies.\n"
