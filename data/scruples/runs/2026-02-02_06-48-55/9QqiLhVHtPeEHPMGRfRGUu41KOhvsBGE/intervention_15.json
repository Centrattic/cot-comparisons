Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and assumed she was cheating. However, when confronted, she claimed she was being raped. The author then kicked her out, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author noticed some red flags: his girlfriend was acting suspiciously, hiding her phone, dressing up unusually, and so on. Then he found the condoms and concluded she was cheating. She responded by saying she was being raped. The author is now conflicted but thinks he might be the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is justified in his assumptions and actions. On one hand, he had suspicions based on her behavior, but he didn't communicate openly first. Instead, he confronted her by finding the condoms, which might have been a privacy invasion. On the other hand, his girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious accusation, and the author dismissed it without giving her a chance to explain properly.\n\nThe author's assumption that she was cheating without direct evidence could be problematic. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and without prior issues, jumping to that conclusion might be hasty. The girlfriend's explanation about being raped, even if it seems contradictory (like dressing up and having condoms), could be a trauma response or an attempt to explain a complex situation. The author's immediate reaction was to not believe her, which might be a mistake. Rape is a serious issue, and dismissing someone's claim can be harmful. However, the girlfriend's actions do seem suspicious, which complicates things.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. He might have valid concerns about infidelity, but his approach to addressing them was flawed. Instead of confronting her with the discovery of the condoms, maybe he should have had an open conversation first. Also, the girlfriend's explanation about being \"abused and can't leave\" could indicate a real issue, even if the details don't immediately make sense. Trauma can affect someone's behavior in ways that aren't obvious.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's assumption that she was cheating without giving her a chance to explain, and then acting on that assumption without verifying the truth, could be seen as wrong. He might have violated her privacy by searching her purse, and dismissed her serious claim without due consideration. However, the situation is complex, and it's hard to say without more context. But based on the information given, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more care and trust.\n"
