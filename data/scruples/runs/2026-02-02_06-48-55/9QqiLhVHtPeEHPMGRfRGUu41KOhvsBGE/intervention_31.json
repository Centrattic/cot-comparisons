Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author found a box of Magnum condoms in their girlfriend's purse when they were about to leave to hang out with friends. The girlfriend then claimed she was being raped, which the author finds confusing and doesn't believe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author noticed some suspicious behavior\u2014like the girlfriend looking for her phone frantically, dressing up unusually, and tilting her phone away. These could be red flags, but they're not proof of anything. Then the condom box is found, which the author immediately assumes is for someone else, leading to the argument. The girlfriend's claim of being raped is met with disbelief by the author, who then kicks her out.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's actions: invading privacy by searching the girlfriend's purse, confronting her with the condoms, and then reacting with anger and disbelief when she claims rape. The girlfriend's side: she was getting dressed up for friends, had the condoms, and now says she's being raped. But the author is skeptical because the actions don't align with their understanding of rape (i.e., dressing up and having condoms implies consent).\n\nBut wait, rape is a serious accusation, and the girlfriend's explanation might not make sense to the author, but that doesn't mean she's lying. The author's response could be harmful. Confronting someone with a found item and then dismissing their serious claim as a lie is problematic. Even if the author doubts the story, the way they handled it\u2014kicking her out without support\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, using a found item (condoms) to accuse or imply infidelity is a privacy breach, especially without talking first.\n\nHowever, the author did state they didn't look in her phone or be nosy otherwise, but searching through a purse for Advil and finding the condoms is a privacy issue. The girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious issue that needs to be taken seriously, regardless of the situation. The author's immediate reaction of disbelief and anger could be seen as dismissive of a potential real crisis. Even if the girlfriend's story is inconsistent, the author should consider supporting her instead of doubting her. \n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014crying and claiming emotional damage\u2014might indicate that the situation is real to her. The author's decision to end the relationship without seeking more understanding or support could be seen as harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel betrayed and hurt, leading to an emotional reaction. However, the way they handled it could be seen as the wrong approach. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for their actions and words, not necessarily the girlfriend's truthfulness. Even if the girlfriend was lying, the author's response of dismissing her claim of rape is inappropriate. Rape is a serious accusation, and it's not up to the partner to validate it. Instead, the author should have supported her or encouraged her to seek help if it's true, or at least not dismissed it outright.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author invaded privacy, reacted with anger, and dismissed a rape claim. Even if the girlfriend was lying, the way the author handled it is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong)."
