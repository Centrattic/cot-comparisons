Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong here. The situation involves him suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, then discovering a box of condoms, reacting strongly, and she claims she's being raped. He then ends the relationship.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's actions: he found the condoms, got angry, kicked her out. But he's basing his conclusion on his own assumptions without talking to her first. He didn't give her a chance to explain, immediately jumped to conclusions. His actions might be impulsive and based on his own insecurities or jealousy.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's side: she says she's being raped. That's a serious allegation. But there are contradictions in her behavior, like dressing up, having condoms, acting suspicious. However, the boyfriend didn't consider that her behavior might be due to being forced, maybe she's in a manipulative situation where she's coerced into those actions. His immediate reaction was to accuse her of cheating instead of believing her or seeking help for her alleged rape.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's judgment of the situation is flawed. He assumes she's lying about the rape to cover cheating, but he doesn't have evidence. He's making accusations without verifying her claims. If she was actually being raped, his immediate rejection might have cut off a support system she needs. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's reaction was harsh and without communication. Instead of discussing, he reacted emotionally and ended the relationship. That's not a mature approach. The girlfriend was crying and seeking support, but he didn't provide it. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend had red flags and valid suspicions. The sudden changes in her behavior were concerning. However, his response was to jump to conclusions and not address the situation with empathy or seek to understand. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. He should have talked to her first before making assumptions and taking drastic actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend's immediate judgment and lack of communication make him at least partially at fault. He didn't handle the situation with the sensitivity it required, especially if her claims of rape were true. However, the girlfriend's behavior was suspicious, but that doesn't absolve the boyfriend of his responsibility to approach the situation more thoughtfully. The key issue is his assumption without evidence and the lack of support if her claims were real. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
