Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation he described. \n\nFirst, the author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend. He noticed some suspicious behaviors, like her acting distracted when looking for her phone, dressing up unusually, and tilting her phone away. Then he found a box of Magnum condoms in her purse. When he confronted her, she said she was being raped, which he found hard to believe because of the other actions she was taking, like using condoms and dressing up. He kicked her out and is now wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is how the author handled the situation. Let's break it down. \n\nHe had suspicions and found evidence that made him think she was cheating. Instead of having an open conversation where he could express his concerns and listen to her side, he immediately jumped to conclusions. When she told him she was being raped, his reaction was anger and disbelief. That's a problem. \n\nWhen someone discloses a serious issue like being raped, the appropriate response is to support them, not to react with anger or skepticism. The author's reaction could have been traumatic for her. Even if he suspected cheating, his approach was hostile. \n\nAlso, he found the condoms and used that as an excuse to confront her, which might not be the best approach. Condoms can have various purposes, but in this case, he didn't consider other explanations (maybe she was helping a friend, or there's another context) and instead immediately assumed the worst. \n\nThe girlfriend's explanation about being a \"side effect\" of abuse (which I think refers to being in an abusive relationship and not being able to leave) might not fully explain the situation, but that doesn't mean the author had the right to kick her out without understanding more. He should have tried to listen and offer support, not judgment. \n\nThe fact that she was crying and felt he didn't care suggests that his response was hurtful. Even if he was hurt, his reaction was not constructive. The right approach would be to seek help, maybe talk to a counselor or a professional, rather than ending the relationship immediately based on his own assumptions without a proper discussion.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author made a mistake in how he handled the situation. He didn't support his girlfriend when she tried to explain her side, and his reaction was likely to make her feel worse. Therefore, he is in the wrong."
