Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, leading to a confrontation where she claims she was being raped.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author noticed some behaviors he found suspicious\u2014like her looking for her phone frantically, dressing up, tilting her phone away, and finding condoms in her purse. When he confronted her, she said she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's unsure if he was right to do so.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want an analysis. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn the author's side: He had reasons to be suspicious\u2014specific behaviors that he found out of character. Finding condoms in her purse, which he can't use, seems like a strong indicator. But he acted on his suspicions without fully hearing her side. His reaction was to kick her out, which might be seen as harsh if her claims were true.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side: She claims she was being raped, which is a serious allegation. If she's telling the truth, the author's actions could be dismissive and harmful. However, her behavior (dressing up, having condoms) doesn't align with a typical rape scenario, which is usually violent and not consensual. The fact that she was \"frozen\" and cried might indicate distress, but that doesn't necessarily prove rape. \n\nRed flags: The author's jealousy and suspicion might have led him to jump to conclusions. However, the condoms being a size that doesn't fit him is a concrete point. Also, if she was being raped by someone else, why would she have condoms? That's conflicting. \n\nBut how do you handle a situation where a partner accuses you of not believing them about a serious issue like rape? The author's reaction could be seen as not supporting her, but if she's lying, then he's justified in ending the relationship. \n\nThe problem is the author didn't allow her to explain properly. Instead of listening, he reacted emotionally. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. However, the girlfriend's explanation seems inconsistent. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong entirely because his actions were based on his observations and the concrete evidence (condoms). However, how he handled the confrontation was poor\u2014he should have listened first before reacting. But given the conflicting information, it's a complex situation. \n\nIn the end, the decision to end the relationship could be seen as a response to his suspicion being proven right (if she was lying) or wrong (if she was truthful). But given the inconsistencies in her story, maybe the author is in the right to end the relationship. However, the way he handled it without giving her a chance to fully explain might make him the asshole. Hmm.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Considering the situation, the author's actions were based on his observations and the concrete evidence (condoms). However, he acted without fully understanding her side. Since rape is a serious accusation, not believing her could make him the asshole if she's telling the truth. But if she's lying, then he's justified. The problem is we don't know the truth. However, the fact that she was getting dressed up and had condoms complicates her rape claim. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because her story doesn't hold up, and he's justified in ending the relationship. Therefore, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
