Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy who found condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then she claims she was being raped. The author is questioning if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The boyfriend noticed some suspicious behaviors: her searching for her phone when he was around, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and then finding condoms. When confronted, she says she was being raped. He then kicks her out, and she accuses him of not caring.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from his perspective, he had reasons to suspect something was off. But when she claimed she was being raped, that's a serious accusation. Even if he was suspicious before, he didn't hear out her explanation. The question is whether he overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, he had some red flags and found evidence that made him think she was cheating. On the other, accusing her of lying about being raped is a big deal. Rape is a serious crime, and dismissing her claim could be hurtful and invalidating. However, if he has valid concerns based on her behavior and the context, maybe he's not entirely wrong to be skeptical.\n\nBut in the end, he didn't give her a proper chance to explain. She might have had a legitimate reason, even if it's not what he assumed. The key here is that when she made the claim, he reacted with anger and didn't listen. That's problematic because he should have tried to understand her side first before making a decision.\n\nAlso, the fact that she was crying and he kicked her out immediately suggests he didn't handle the situation with empathy. Even if he had suspicions, the way he responded could be seen as harsh. So, while he might have had some valid concerns, his reaction could be considered inconsiderate and dismissive of her potential trauma.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not giving her a chance to explain and for reacting so strongly without understanding her side. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
