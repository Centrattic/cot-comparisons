Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found condoms in his girlfriend's purse and reacted by accusing her of cheating or being raped. The girlfriend then claimed she was getting raped, which made the author kick her out. \n\nFirst, the author is assuming his girlfriend was cheating based on finding condoms. Condoms can be used for consensual sex or for protection, but the presence alone doesn't prove infidelity. Maybe she's taking precautions, or maybe she's helping a friend, but the author jumps to conclusions.\n\nThen, when the girlfriend says she's being raped, the author dismisses her. If someone claims they're being raped, the appropriate response isn't to accuse them of lying or cheating. Instead, you should support them, believe them, and help them get help. The author's reaction seems to invalidate her claim, which is really serious. \n\nThe author's reasoning about the condom size (Magnum) not fitting him is a bit of a red herring. That doesn't necessarily mean she's lying about being raped. The girlfriend's explanation that she's in an abusive situation where she can't leave is a possible scenario, but the author didn't give her a chance to explain further. He immediately took her out of the house without listening properly.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior\u2014like acting distracted when her phone is involved, dressing up in a way that's out of character, and tilting her phone away\u2014could be signs of something else. Maybe she's in a controlling relationship where she's trying to hide communication. But instead of addressing these issues with her, the author made assumptions and reacted harshly.\n\nIn terms of trust and communication, the author didn't handle it well. Instead of discussing his concerns and trying to understand, he made a unilateral decision based on finding condoms and then dismissed her when she tried to explain. The way he kicked her out and told her not to talk to him anymore is pretty extreme and doesn't allow for any resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior is suspicious. But if she's in an abusive situation, she might be trying to protect herself or someone else. The author's reaction doesn't consider that possibility and instead jumps to conclusions, which could be harmful if her situation is real.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author didn't support his girlfriend when she claimed to be in danger, he made assumptions without evidence, and his reaction was harsh and dismissive. Even if she was lying, the correct approach would be to seek help and not to invalidate her claims. Therefore, the author's actions were inappropriate and he's in the wrong.\n"
