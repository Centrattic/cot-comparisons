Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The author's girlfriend claims she's being raped, but he found condoms and noticed odd behavior. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to analyze it carefully.\n\nFirst, let's outline the key points. The author noticed his girlfriend acting suspiciously: looking for her phone when he's around, dressing up more than usual, and tilting her phone away. Then he found a box of condoms in her purse. She then claims she was being raped. The author reacts by kicking her out, feeling betrayed.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's actions that the author noticed\u2014like the phone searching and dressing up\u2014could be red flags, but they don't necessarily indicate cheating or lying. The author's immediate assumption is that she's lying about being raped. However, accusing someone of lying about rape is extremely serious. Rape is a traumatic experience, and making such a claim without understanding the context can be harmful.\n\nThe girlfriend's explanation is that she can't leave the situation, which might point to a case of ongoing abuse or manipulation. The author's reaction\u2014breaking up abruptly without seeking more information\u2014might be seen as dismissive. Even if there's suspicion of lying, the author should consider the possibility that the girlfriend is in a dangerous situation and needs support, not judgment.\n\nAlso, the author found the condoms, which he assumed were for his use, but his reasoning is flawed because he can't use them. That might show a lack of communication in the relationship. The girlfriend's emotional response (crying, saying he doesn't care) suggests she felt exposed or misunderstood.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that the situation doesn't align logically\u2014why would she be dressed up and have condoms if it's non-consensual? That's a valid point, but it's possible she's in a coercive relationship where she's forced to dress up and have sex, hence needing condoms for the encounters. The author might not be considering that angle.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's claims are true, then the author's reaction is dismissive and could be harmful. But if she's lying, then the author acted on his suspicions. However, the way he confronted her (stealing the condoms and confronting her) might be seen as confrontational rather than supportive. The author should have approached the situation with more empathy and sought to understand her situation first, rather than assuming deceit.\n\nIn cases of alleged rape or abuse, the appropriate response is to support the victim and encourage them to seek help, not to immediately accuse them of lying. The author's actions could be seen as invalidating her experience, regardless of the truth. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with the necessary care and support.\n"
