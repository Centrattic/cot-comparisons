Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse, which he assumed were for another man, leading him to confront her. She then claimed she was being raped, which he found hard to believe because of her behavior, like dressing up and the presence of condoms. The author ended up breaking up with her, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is the author's reaction and his assumption. When he found the condoms, he immediately jumped to the conclusion that she was cheating, without giving her a chance to explain. Then when she provided an explanation (being raped), he dismissed it as a possible lie or a side effect of being abused. But is it reasonable to dismiss a rape claim, especially without any evidence?\n\nIt's important to note that in real life, any allegation of rape is a serious matter and should be taken seriously. However, the author's judgment here is based on his perception of her behavior. He's trying to reconcile the presence of condoms and her appearance with the claim of non-consensual activity. But maybe there are explanations he hasn't considered. For example, maybe she was trying to prevent pregnancy in a situation where she was coerced, or she was in a situation where she felt she couldn't say no but wanted to look presentable. But the author is quick to doubt her, which could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because he felt betrayed and had been noticing suspicious behavior. However, instead of addressing his concerns calmly, he reacted with anger and disbelief. The way he confronted her by taking the box and going to the bathroom might have been confrontational. Then, when she provided a serious explanation, his immediate dismissal without seeking more information or support could be problematic.\n\nAdditionally, the author is in a position where he's making a judgment that could affect her credibility. Rape is a sensitive issue, and dismissing someone's claim can be harmful. Even if he suspects she's lying, he should approach it with more empathy and possibly seek external support or evidence rather than just breaking up with her.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of trust and his own feelings. If he noticed red flags and felt betrayed, his emotional response is understandable. But the way he handled the situation\u2014immediately doubting her claim of rape\u2014might be where he went wrong. It's not his place to judge whether the rape occurred; instead, he should support her or advise her to seek help, rather than invalidating her experience.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision to break up and his immediate disbelief might have been hasty. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether his actions were reasonable given the circumstances. However, in terms of how society views these situations, questioning a rape claim without substantial evidence is generally seen as wrong. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for dismissing her explanation without proper consideration."
