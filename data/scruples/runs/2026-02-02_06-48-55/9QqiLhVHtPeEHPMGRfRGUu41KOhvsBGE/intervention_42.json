Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves his girlfriend, who he found condoms and other suspicious behavior. He accuses her of cheating, she says she was being raped. He kicks her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author found condoms in her purse, noticed her acting strangely around her phone, and she's dressing up more than usual. When confronted, she claims she was being raped. He doesn't believe her and ends the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and communication. The author's actions (going through her belongings, not trusting her) might be problematic. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and if he didn't communicate his concerns earlier, that could be his fault. However, the girlfriend's explanation is that she was being raped, which is a serious accusation. If she actually was being raped, that's a critical issue that should be addressed with support, not accusations of cheating.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's behavior does seem odd if she was being raped. If she was dressing up and had condoms, that might not align with a non-consensual situation. However, maybe she had a different reason for the condoms. Also, her reaction of freezing and crying when confronted could be genuine distress. \n\nThe author's response\u2014kicking her out without seeking more information\u2014might be hasty. Instead of immediately breaking up, maybe he should have tried to understand her side more. However, if he truly didn't trust her and the behaviors were suspicious, he might have felt justified in ending the relationship.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend was actually being raped, then the author's reaction is invalid and he's in the wrong. But if she lied about being raped to cover cheating, then he's right to end the relationship. The problem is we don't have all the facts.\n\nIn such cases, the initial response to an emotional disclosure (rape) should be supportive, not confrontational with accusations. The author didn't handle it well. He should have believed her first and then asked questions. By immediately doubting her, he's not providing the support someone might need if they're in a traumatic situation. Even if she's lying, his reaction could have worsened the situation. \n\nSo, considering the ethical angle, even if the girlfriend lied, the author's immediate judgment and lack of support could be seen as wrong. Trust issues should be addressed through communication, not accusations. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and support, especially if she was truly in distress.\n"
