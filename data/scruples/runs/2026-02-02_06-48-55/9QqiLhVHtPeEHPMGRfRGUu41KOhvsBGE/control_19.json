Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the author found condoms in his girlfriend's purse and accused her of cheating, but she claimed she was being raped. The user is asking if the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: his girlfriend was acting oddly around him, dressing up more than usual, and hiding her phone. Then he found the condoms, which made him think she was cheating. When confronted, she said she was being raped. The author didn't believe her and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't have any direct evidence of cheating beyond the condoms. Condoms can be for various reasons, like protection, not necessarily infidelity. The girlfriend's claim of being raped is serious. If she was being raped, then the author's reaction might be seen as dismissive or not taking her seriously. However, the girlfriend's behavior (dressing up, hiding phone) could be red flags, but they don't necessarily confirm cheating or rape. \n\nThe problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain further. He immediately assumed the worst and kicked her out. But if the girlfriend was indeed being raped, then the author's response could be harmful. On the other hand, if she was lying about the rape to cover up cheating, then the author might have had a reason to be upset. However, the way he reacted without giving her a chance to provide more context could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: the author was in her personal space (searching her purse) without permission. That's an invasion of privacy. Even if he had suspicions, taking her stuff without her consent might be a breach of trust. The way he handled the confrontation\u2014grabbing the box and going into the bathroom\u2014could be seen as confrontational and not supportive. \n\nThe girlfriend claimed it's a side effect of being abused and not being able to leave, which is a known psychological aspect of abuse. The author didn't believe her explanation, which could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding of domestic violence situations. If she was in an abusive situation, the author's reaction might have made her feel unsupported, which is bad. However, he also has the right to be concerned about fidelity in the relationship.\n\nBut the main issue is the author's immediate judgment without seeking the full story. Instead of believing her claim of rape, he dismissed it as a lie. Rape is a serious accusation, and if the girlfriend was telling the truth, the author's response is not supportive. However, if she was lying, then he might be justified in breaking up. The problem is we don't know the truth. The question is whether he's in the wrong regardless of the truth.\n\nIn terms of the situation described, the author acted on suspicion without concrete evidence, invaded her privacy, and didn't give her a chance to explain properly. His reaction could be seen as harsh, especially if she genuinely was being abused. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not supporting her if her claim was true, and for the way he handled the confrontation.\n"
