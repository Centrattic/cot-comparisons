Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author found a box of Magnum condoms in his girlfriend's purse while she was going to meet her friends. He took it as evidence she was cheating. She then told him she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The girlfriend's behavior was a bit odd\u2014looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, and her phone tilted away. The author noticed these red flags. Then, finding the condoms led him to confront her. She said she was being raped. The author is confused because the scenario she described (being raped while dressed up and having condoms) seems contradictory. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's more to the story. If someone is being raped, they might be in a situation where they can't resist or escape, even if they're dressed nicely. The girlfriend mentioned it could be a side effect of being abused and not able to leave. That could mean she's in a coercive relationship with Rick. The author, however, didn't believe her explanation and immediately assumed cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction\u2014kicking her out and cutting off contact\u2014might be harsh if she was telling the truth. But if the girlfriend was lying or manipulative, he's protecting himself. The problem is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain further. He jumped to conclusions based on the condoms, which might not be the best evidence. \n\nThe key here is the author's assumption. He didn't verify the situation, didn't hear her out, and reacted emotionally. If the girlfriend was indeed being raped, his response was dismissive. But if she was lying, he's justified. Since we don't know the full truth, but the question is about who is in the wrong, the author is in a tough spot. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's explanation, while confusing, is a serious accusation. If the author immediately dismissed it without proper investigation, he's in the wrong. But if he's just skeptical and reacting to what he perceives as deceit, it's more complicated. The answer hinges on whether the author acted without giving a chance to clarify. Since he didn't seek more information and took immediate action, he's likely in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
