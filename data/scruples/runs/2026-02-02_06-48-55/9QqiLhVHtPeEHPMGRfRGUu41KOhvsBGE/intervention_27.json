Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who is accused of cheating, but she claims she was being raped. The author found condoms in her purse, noticed her acting suspiciously, and ended up breaking up with her after she made that claim.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions red flags like her looking for her phone frantically, getting dressed up unusually, and tilting her phone away. But the key moment is when he finds the condoms and she responds by saying she's being raped. The author then kicks her out, feeling betrayed and angry.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is the asshole. From a moral standpoint, accusing someone of cheating without solid evidence can be problematic. Even if there were red flags, the leap to cheating might not be justified. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a serious accusation. If she was indeed being non-consensually involved with someone else, then the situation is more complex. But the author's reaction\u2014immediately breaking up and not giving her a chance to explain further\u2014might be hasty if she's telling the truth.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's behavior (getting dressed up, having condoms) doesn't align with the claim of being raped, which might indicate a cover-up. The author could be right to be suspicious. But accusing her of cheating and then breaking up based on that without more proof could be seen as jumping to conclusions. Also, reacting to her rape claim by breaking up might not be supportive if she's actually a victim.\n\nBut if the girlfriend's story is a lie to cover up cheating, then the author's reaction is understandable. The problem is the lack of evidence on both sides. The author might be in the wrong for not giving her the benefit of the doubt regarding her rape claim, which is a serious matter. Alternatively, if the rape claim is a lie, the author is justified in ending the relationship.\n\nConsidering all factors, the situation is messy. The author acted on suspicion without concrete proof, which could be seen as wrong. The girlfriend's response with such a serious accusation might also be a manipulation tactic. However, the author's actions in responding to the rape claim by breaking up might not be supportive. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because he made a judgment based on circumstantial evidence and didn't handle the serious accusation with more care.\n"
