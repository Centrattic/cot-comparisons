Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy found condoms in his girlfriend's purse, and she claimed she was being raped. He didn't believe her and broke up with her. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he noticed some suspicious behaviors, like her being secretive with her phone, acting distracted, and suddenly getting fancy. Then he found the condoms, which led him to assume she was cheating. When confronted, she said she was being raped, but he didn't believe her because of the contradictions (dressing up, having condoms). He kicked her out.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend accused of being raped. If she was actually a victim, then the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. But if she lied, then the author might have been right to question her. The problem is we don't know the truth.\n\nBut the key point here is that the author didn't give her the benefit of the doubt when she made such a serious accusation. Even if he was suspicious, when she said she was being raped, he should have taken that seriously. Dismissing someone's claim of rape outright is a big issue. The fact that he called her out for lying and kicked her out without trying to understand more suggests he didn't take her seriously. \n\nAlso, the way he acted\u2014calling her a liar, being angry\u2014could have made her feel blamed. Even if he was wronged, his response was harsh and not supportive. The question is whether he's in the wrong, and since he didn't believe her when she claimed rape, that's a red flag. The correct approach would be to support her and encourage her to report it, not to accuse her of lying. \n\nSo, even if there were red flags, the author's reaction to her claim of rape is what's problematic. The answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't take her accusation seriously.\n"
