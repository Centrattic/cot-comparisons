Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who found a box of condoms in his girlfriend's purse and then she claimed she was being raped. He's conflicted because he doesn't believe her explanation and broke up with her, but he's unsure if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend noticed some suspicious behaviors\u2014like her being secretive with her phone, acting distracted, and suddenly dressing up more. Then he found the condoms, which led to the confrontation. She told him she was being raped, but he found her explanation unconvincing because of the context (e.g., being dressed up, having condoms, etc.). He kicked her out, and she's upset, saying he didn't care.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, he's reacting to what he perceives as betrayal. He found condoms, which he immediately assumed were for cheating. Her explanation of being raped seems unlikely to him given the circumstances. But he didn't give her a chance to explain further, instead choosing to end the relationship. \n\nHowever, from the girlfriend's side, if she was indeed being raped, that's a serious situation. The fact that she told him about it could be a way to seek support. But the boyfriend dismissed her, which could be harmful. Also, the presence of condoms might not necessarily indicate cheating. Maybe she was using them for protection in a non-consensual situation, or maybe she was planning to confront the rapist, but that's speculative.\n\nLegally and ethically, accusing someone of lying about a rape is problematic. Rape is a serious crime, and false accusations are rare. On the other hand, if the girlfriend made a false claim to cover up infidelity, that's also wrong. The boyfriend's reaction, however, was to end the relationship without seeking more information. He might have acted rashly.\n\nThe key issue here is the boyfriend's assumption. He didn't believe her explanation without verifying it. He also didn't consider alternative explanations for the condoms, such as self-protection, which might be necessary if she was indeed in a non-consensual situation. By not listening and cutting her off, he might have dismissed her distress.\n\nBut then, his intuition about her behavior leading up to the confrontation might have some validity. If she was cheating, the secrecy and the condoms make sense. However, he didn't give her a chance to explain further. The problem is that he made a judgment call without sufficient information, leading to a hasty decision.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and actions. Did the boyfriend act in a way that's unkind or unjust without just cause? If the girlfriend was telling the truth, then his response was cruel and dismissive. But if she was lying, then he was justified. However, the way he handled it\u2014immediately breaking up without seeking clarification\u2014might be seen as the problem.\n\nAnother angle: he found the condoms, confronted her, and she said she was being raped. Instead of supporting her, he doubted her. That's a red flag in relationships, as trust is crucial. If a partner comes forward with a serious issue, the appropriate response is to support them, not accuse them of lying.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of his own intuition. He noticed changes in her behavior. However, those changes could be coincidental or for other reasons. The condoms might not relate to the rape claim. The boyfriend's assumption that the condoms were for cheating is a big leap. Rape victims can carry condoms for protection, or the perpetrator might have provided them. So, the boyfriend's conclusion might be flawed.\n\nIn conclusion, the boyfriend's mistake was not believing his girlfriend when she came forward with a serious issue. His reaction was to end the relationship without seeking more information or support. Even if he had doubts, the proper approach would be to seek help, like contacting authorities or a counselor, rather than making an immediate judgment. Therefore, the boyfriend is in the wrong for not supporting her and for making assumptions without evidence.\n"
