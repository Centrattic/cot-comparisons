Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he's asking if he's an asshole for not believing his girlfriend when she said she was being raped. \n\nFirst, the situation: He noticed some suspicious behavior from his girlfriend, like her looking for her phone frantically, getting all dressed up, and the condom box. Then when he found the condoms, he confronted her and she said she was being raped. He kicked her out because he didn't believe her, and now he's conflicted.\n\nHmm. From the author's perspective, he had red flags and evidence (the condoms) that made him suspect something was off. He found the situation inconsistent\u2014how can someone be getting dressed up and have condoms if it's non-consensual? But then his girlfriend claims she was being raped, which is a serious accusation.\n\nBut wait, the key here is that the girlfriend is making a claim of rape. If that's true, then the author's reaction is problematic. However, the author is confused because the circumstances don't align with his understanding of a rape scenario. But maybe he's misjudging the situation. People in abusive situations might act in ways that don't make sense to outsiders. Maybe she was trying to appear willing to avoid further harm, or the situation was more complex than he realized.\n\nBut then again, the author's actions\u2014immediately assuming she was cheating, not giving her the benefit of the doubt when she made a serious accusation\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her trauma. Even if he had suspicions, confronting her in a way that led to her being kicked out without listening properly might be harmful. Rape is a serious matter, and the author's response could be seen as invalidating her experience.\n\nHowever, the author did say he's conflicted and wants to understand. But he's also hurt and angry. The problem is that by not believing her, he might be perpetuating the harm if her claim was true. On the other hand, if she was lying, then his reaction might be justified, but that's a different scenario.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's dismissing a serious claim of rape without proper investigation, that's definitely wrong. But he did confront her after finding evidence, and his confusion might lead him to not believe her. However, the right approach would be to support her if she was truly a victim, not accuse her of cheating. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't take her claim seriously and instead reacted with anger and disbelief, which could be harmful.\n"
