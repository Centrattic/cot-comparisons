Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating, leading to a confrontation where she claims she was being raped. The author ends up breaking up with her, feeling betrayed and confused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: the girlfriend acting distracted when looking for her phone, dressing up unusually, tilting her phone away, and finding a box of condoms. These signs led him to conclude she was cheating. When confronted, she told him she was being raped, which shocked him, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not wrong). \n\nI should evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's actions might be seen as overreacting based on circumstantial evidence. He didn't have concrete proof of cheating and acted on assumptions. However, his girlfriend's explanation that she was being raped is a serious accusation. If true, the author's reaction might be seen as dismissive or not supporting her. But if false, then his actions might be justified based on the evidence he had.\n\nBut here's the catch: the girlfriend's story doesn't align with the evidence. If she was being raped, why would she be dressed up and have condoms? The author points out that these are red flags. Her explanation about being abused and not being able to leave is vague and doesn't address the specific inconsistencies. \n\nIn real-life scenarios, trusting someone's claim about being a victim is important, but there's also the need for reasonable belief. The author's suspicion isn't baseless, but his confrontation method might be harsh. However, given the inconsistencies in her story, he might be justified in questioning her. \n\nAnother angle: the author found the condoms, which could indicate consent if she's with someone else. The girlfriend's immediate reaction to cry and claim rape without providing concrete details might undermine her credibility. The author's decision to end the relationship might be based on not being able to reconcile the contradictions.\n\nBut legally and ethically, accusing someone of rape is a serious matter. If the author is making assumptions without proof, he could be wrong. However, the situation is complex because the girlfriend's behavior doesn't align with her claim. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. He acted on suspicions without proof, which is a mistake, but his girlfriend's story has inconsistencies. However, the way he reacted\u2014breaking up immediately without seeking more information\u2014might not be the right approach. But given the conflicting evidence, it's a nuanced case. Still, the author's initial judgment might be hasty, leading to him being in the wrong (A) because he didn't give her the benefit of the doubt properly.\n"
