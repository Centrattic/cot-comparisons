Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend was accused of cheating because he found condoms and noticed some suspicious behavior. She responded by saying she was being raped. The author is now conflicted about whether he was right to break up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he noticed her acting strangely, searching for her phone, dressing up unusually, and then finding condoms. When confronted, she said she was being raped. He felt betrayed and kicked her out. He's questioning if he was right to not believe her.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend claims she was being raped. Even if her behavior seemed odd, maybe there's a valid reason. The author's reaction was to not believe her, which could be harmful if she was indeed a victim. Also, the situation where someone is a victim of abuse might make them act in ways that seem contradictory, like dressing up or not leaving the situation immediately. It's possible she was in a coercive situation where she felt trapped, even if it didn't look like it from the outside.\n\nBut then, the author found evidence that seems suspicious. Condoms in her purse, combined with other behaviors, might make someone question. However, the author's approach was to confront her and then break up without fully understanding the context. The girlfriend's explanation about being a victim of abuse was dismissed quickly. The author didn't give her a chance to explain further, which is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction was anger and not empathy. If someone discloses being a victim of rape, the appropriate response is to support them, not to accuse them of lying. Even if there are doubts, the immediate response should be to validate their feelings and offer help, not to end the relationship. The author's actions might have dismissed her potential trauma and invalidated her experience.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's behavior was inconsistent with someone being a victim of rape. Dressing up and having condoms could be indicative of consensual sex, which is why the author was confused. But people can be in abusive situations where they're forced into things, and their actions might not align with what the author expects. It's possible that the girlfriend was in a situation where she felt she had no control, hence the odd behavior.\n\nThe key here is that the author didn't seek to understand the context of her claim. Instead, he reacted with anger and disbelief. If the girlfriend was indeed a victim, the author's response could have caused her more harm. If she was lying, then the author had valid concerns. But without more information, the immediate assumption of deceit without support is harmful.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author made a judgment without fully considering the possibility that she was telling the truth. His reaction was to punish her and cut her off, which is not the right approach when someone discloses abuse. Even if he had doubts, the proper way would be to seek help, like contacting professionals or authorities, instead of assuming she's lying.\n\nSo, balancing both perspectives, the author's immediate dismissal of her claim and the way he handled the situation is where he went wrong. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respond appropriately to a potential disclosure of rape and instead acted on suspicion without support or understanding.\n"
