Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author suspecting their girlfriend of cheating but she claims she was getting raped. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA). The answer options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: girlfriend acting strangely when searching for her phone, dressing up unusually, avoiding looking at her phone when together, and then finding condoms. When confronted, the girlfriend says she's being raped. The author reacts by kicking her out, feeling angry and humiliated. The girlfriend claims she was bawling and says the author doesn't care.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's suspicion vs. the girlfriend's accusation. The author's actions\u2014finding the condoms and then reacting by ending the relationship\u2014seems justified if the girlfriend was lying. However, if the girlfriend was actually being raped, then the author's reaction might be seen as invalidating a serious situation.\n\nBut the girlfriend's behavior is contradictory. If she's being raped, why dress up, have condoms? Those actions don't align with non-consensual situations. The author's skepticism is understandable given these contradictions. However, confronting someone with an accusation of rape is a huge step, and the author did so in a public manner (kicking her out) without verifying the truth.\n\nBut the author's initial reaction was based on suspicion, not proof. The girlfriend's story doesn't hold up under scrutiny, which the author rightly pointed out. However, the author didn't give her a chance to explain before reacting. The girlfriend's claim of being raped could be a lie to deflect from cheating. If that's the case, the author might have been right to be upset. However, bringing up rape accusations is sensitive and serious, and the author's immediate reaction might have been harsh.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend was lying about rape, then the author's actions would be justified. However, if the author dismissed her genuine situation, then that's a problem. The story doesn't have enough evidence to know the truth. However, based on the given info, the author acted on suspicion and not proven facts. The girlfriend's actions (condoms, dressing up) don't align with non-consensual acts. \n\nIn relationships, trust is key. The author's suspicion led to conflict. The girlfriend's response with the rape accusation seems like a deflection. The author's anger is understandable if they felt lied to. But accusing someone of being an asshole if you kick someone out after such an accusation is tricky. The author might have had valid reasons to question the situation but handled it poorly. However, the girlfriend's accusation could be manipulative. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not necessarily in the wrong if the girlfriend was lying. However, making such a serious accusation (rape) and then being dismissed might be seen as the author being quick to judge. But in the absence of clear proof, the author had reasons to be skeptical. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the author acted on their suspicions, which had some basis, and the girlfriend's explanation is contradictory. However, the way they handled it could be seen as harsh, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's actions don't align with her story, the author's reaction is more justified. So answer B.\n"
