Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suspecting his girlfriend of cheating and then reacting strongly when he finds a box of condoms. She claims she was being raped, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author noticed several red flags: his girlfriend was acting strangely when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, and turning her phone away. Then he found the condoms and confronted her. She responded by saying she was being raped. He kicked her out, and now he's conflicted about whether he was right to do so.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to assess both sides. Let's consider the girlfriend's claim of being raped. Rape is a serious accusation, and if it's true, the author's reaction is inappropriate. However, the author observed behaviors that he found suspicious, and the girlfriend's explanation seems inconsistent with those behaviors. For instance, dressing up and having condoms in her possession might not align with being a victim of rape, which is typically non-consensual. Also, her reaction when confronted\u2014freezing and crying\u2014could be genuine, but the author's immediate assumption of cheating and the way he confronted her might have been harsh.\n\nAnother angle is the author's actions. He didn't wait for a full explanation; he kicked her out immediately. If the girlfriend is telling the truth about being a victim of rape, the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive and not supportive. However, if the girlfriend is lying about the rape to cover up cheating, the author might have a point in feeling betrayed.\n\nBut here's the thing: making assumptions without concrete evidence can be problematic. The author jumped to conclusions based on his observations and the finding of the condoms. Even if he's right about the cheating, the way he handled it and the girlfriend's claim of rape adds another layer. If the girlfriend was indeed being raped, the author's reaction is not only wrong but could be harmful. If she's lying, then the author's actions are justified in some way, but the method of confrontation is still questionable.\n\nThe key here is that the author didn't give her a chance to explain before taking action. Without verifying her claim and treating her as a victim in need of support, he made a hasty decision. Even if he suspects deceit, the proper approach would be to listen to her explanation first, perhaps seek evidence, and consider seeking help from authorities or a counselor before ending the relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's immediate reaction without a thorough conversation and verification of her claim might make him the asshole. He didn't handle the situation with the sensitivity it requires if her rape claim is true. Even if his suspicions were correct, the way he confronted her and ended the relationship without a proper discussion is problematic.\n"
