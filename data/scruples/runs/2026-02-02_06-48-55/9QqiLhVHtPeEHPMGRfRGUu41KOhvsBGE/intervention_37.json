Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend was talking to someone named Rick, and the guy (author) noticed some suspicious behaviors. She was acting frantic when looking for her phone, dressing up in a fancy way which was unusual for her, tilting her phone away, and then he found a box of magnum condoms in her purse.\n\nHe thought she was cheating, but she said she was being raped. The guy kicked her out, feeling betrayed. Now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of consent and the girlfriend's claim of being raped. If she was saying she was being raped, that's a serious accusation. But the author's actions of invading her privacy by looking in her purse, then reacting by kicking her out and not listening to her explanation could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior did raise red flags for the author. He noticed changes in her behavior, which led him to find the condoms. But the fact that she was dressing up and had condoms, which he assumed were for her and Rick, might not necessarily indicate cheating. It could be that she was trying to get out of an abusive situation, using the condoms for protection if she felt she couldn't say no. \n\nThe author's immediate reaction was to accuse her of cheating and not hear her out. If she was being raped, that's a traumatic experience, and his response of anger and not validating her situation could be harmful. The girlfriend's claim of \"it could be a side effect like those people who can't leave\" refers to trauma responses where abuse victims don't act in expected ways. \n\nThe author might have made a wrong assumption based on his own perspective without considering her possible trauma. Invasion of privacy (checking her purse without consent) is a big issue here. Even if he had concerns, he could have approached the situation differently, like talking to her about his concerns instead of taking matters into his own hands. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be at fault because he didn't give her a chance to explain, reacted with anger, and invalidated her claims. But the girlfriend's actions were also suspicious, and the author is in a position where he's dealing with trust issues. However, handling it by invading her privacy and not listening to her explanation is problematic. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the key is whether the author overreacted. Since he made an assumption without proper understanding and acted on it in a hurtful way, he might be the asshole. But there's also the aspect of his right to be concerned about possible infidelity. However, the way he handled it was poor. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't address the situation appropriately, invaded her privacy, and didn't validate her traumatic experience. However, there's a balance here. The girlfriend's explanation of being raped could be genuine, and the author's response was dismissive. Therefore, the author is at fault for his actions.\n"
