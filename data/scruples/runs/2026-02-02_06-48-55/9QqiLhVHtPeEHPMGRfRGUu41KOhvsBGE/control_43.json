Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend was talking to someone named Rick, and he noticed some red flags. She was acting suspiciously, like hiding her phone and getting fancy dressed. Then he found a box of Magnum condoms, which he couldn't use, so he assumed she was cheating. But she said she was being raped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author found condoms in her purse, which he thought were for him, but realized they must be for someone else. When confronted, she said she was being raped. The author then kicked her out, feeling betrayed.\n\nThe key points here are: Did he have a reasonable suspicion, or did he jump to conclusions without evidence? He noticed her behavior changed, but those changes could be explained in other ways. For example, maybe she had a legitimate reason to dress up, or the condoms were for protection in a relationship she wasn't supposed to be in. But when he found the condoms, he assumed the worst. \n\nHowever, when she told him she was being raped, he didn't take her seriously. Instead of believing her, he accused her of lying. That's a big issue. If someone says they're being raped, it's a serious allegation, and the proper response would be to believe them and offer support, not to accuse them of cheating and kick them out. \n\nBut there's a conflict here. If she was truly being raped, why would she have the condoms? That doesn't make sense. On the other hand, if she was cheating, she might be acting suspiciously. The author didn't have enough evidence to confirm either scenario. He made an assumption based on the condoms and her behavior. \n\nThe problem is that when she claimed to be a victim, he dismissed her story. That's a major red flag. It's important to take such claims seriously, even if there are inconsistencies. The author acted out of anger and suspicion rather than seeking to understand the truth. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's own behavior. He was acting nosy by going through her purse, which might have contributed to the conflict. However, the critical point is his response to her accusation of rape. \n\nIn many cases, the default should be to believe someone when they say they're being assaulted. The author didn't do that, which could be seen as in the wrong. However, the situation is complicated because of the condoms and her behavior. But those actions don't necessarily prove cheating, nor do they disprove rape. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author acted on assumptions without verifying the facts. His immediate reaction was to accuse her of lying and kick her out, which is not a constructive approach. The correct approach would be to seek more information and support her, regardless of the situation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't believe her initial claim of rape and reacted in a hurtful way.\n"
