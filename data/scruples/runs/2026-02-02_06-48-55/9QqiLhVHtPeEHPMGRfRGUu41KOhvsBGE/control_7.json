Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is the asshole (AITA) for not believing their girlfriend when she said she was being raped. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author noticed several suspicious behaviors from their girlfriend, like her acting distracted when looking for her phone, dressing up more than usual, tilting her phone away, and finding a box of condoms in her purse. When confronted, the girlfriend claimed she was being raped, leading to the argument and her being kicked out.\n\nThe key points here are about the author's right to question the situation versus the girlfriend's claim of being raped. The author is in a dilemma between their trust issues and the girlfriend's serious accusation. The girlfriend's explanation that it's a side effect of abuse where she can't leave doesn't make sense to the author, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and emotional aspects. Rape is a serious accusation, and the author is in a position where they are not the one in danger. The girlfriend is the one making the claim and should presumably seek support from authorities or other resources. However, the author is also a partner who noticed unusual behavior and felt betrayed upon finding the condoms.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author's response was to kick her out without fully understanding the situation. However, the girlfriend's claim of being raped is a severe allegation. In reality, if someone is being raped, they should go to the police or a safe place, not expect their partner to accept it without evidence. On the other hand, the author's suspicion might be justified, given the context, but the way he confronted her (taking the condoms and walking into the bathroom) could have been handled more sensitively.\n\nThe problem is that the author is not in a position to judge the validity of the rape claim. Even if there are red flags, accusing someone of lying about rape is a serious accusation. However, the girlfriend's behavior (dressing up, having condoms) doesn't necessarily align with a non-consensual situation. But the author is not a trained professional to assess that.\n\nThe girlfriend's response of \"getting raped\" might have been a defensive reaction to being caught with condoms, perhaps to avoid admitting infidelity. But the author, in their anger and hurt, might have overreacted by not giving her a chance to explain further. However, the girlfriend's initial accusation of rape is problematic because it's a serious charge that shouldn't be used lightly.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, he did confront her in a way that led to a breakdown, but he also had evidence (condoms) that made him question the relationship. However, he chose to end the relationship based on her claim of rape, which might not be the right approach. Rape is a criminal matter and should be reported to authorities, not handled by the partner.\n\nSo, the author's main mistake might be not considering that the girlfriend's claim of being raped could be a cry for help or a misunderstanding, but instead deciding to end the relationship immediately. However, the girlfriend's use of the rape accusation could be a manipulation tactic. \n\nThe answer is tricky because both sides have issues. The author is in a difficult position, but he shouldn't have assumed she was lying about rape without proper context. However, the girlfriend's behavior and the context of finding condoms might indicate infidelity. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, the author is not the one who is being assaulted. The girlfriend made a serious accusation that the author is not equipped to validate. So, the author is not in the wrong for questioning her, but he could have handled it better. However, the girlfriend's use of the rape claim to deflect from infidelity is problematic. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the girlfriend truly was being raped or not. If she was lying, then she's at fault. If she genuinely was in an abusive situation, the author is wrong to dismiss her. But since the story doesn't provide enough evidence, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not believing her. \n\nIn the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the answer would likely be B (No) because the author had valid suspicions and the girlfriend's claim of rape doesn't align with the evidence presented. However, the author should have approached the situation with more empathy and perhaps sought a more thorough understanding before ending the relationship. But given the information, the author isn't the one in the wrong.\n"
