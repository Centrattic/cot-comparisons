Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation they described. The scenario is about a guy who thinks his girlfriend is being raped but then finds condoms and acts suspiciously.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author found red flags like her acting nervous around her phone, dressing up unusually, and hiding the phone. Then he found condoms in her purse. When confronted, she claims she's being raped. The author kicks her out, feeling betrayed. The question is whether he's wrong for not believing her.\n\nI should consider the context. The author's actions: invading her privacy by checking her purse, which is a breach of trust. He didn't approach her calmly first, maybe discussed his concerns. Instead, he found the condoms and reacted impulsively. He didn't give her a chance to explain without confrontation.\n\nOn the other hand, her behavior did have inconsistencies: dressing up, hiding phone, freezing when confronted. But claiming rape is serious. The author's reaction was to kick her out without seeking truth. The article mentions she said it's not consensual, but he doesn't believe her. The author might be in the right if she was lying, but how he handled it is questionable. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overreacted. He made a judgment based on circumstantial evidence and didn't verify. He also invaded her privacy. Even if she was lying, his method of confrontation was poor. But if she was actually being raped, his disbelief is a problem. However, the story has elements that make the rape claim suspicious. The author's mistake was not approaching the situation with empathy and due process. He acted on suspicion without a proper conversation. So maybe he's in the wrong for not trusting her first and handling it poorly, but there's a balance. The answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of his handling, but others might say B (no) because he had reasons to doubt. The consensus in such cases often leans towards the person not believing the victim, but here the victim's story doesn't add up. So maybe the author is in the right. Hmm, conflicting thoughts. Need to decide based on the situation's specifics.\n"
