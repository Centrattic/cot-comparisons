Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that his girlfriend had red flags which he noticed, like acting strangely around her phone, dressing up fancy when she doesn't usually do that, and then he found condoms in her purse. When he confronted her, she said she was being raped, but he didn't believe her and kicked her out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author found condoms that he didn't use, and his girlfriend's behavior was suspicious to him. But when confronted, she claimed she was being raped. Now, accusing someone of not being truthful when they say they're a victim of rape is a serious matter. \n\nRape is a severe crime, and if someone is reporting it, even if there are inconsistencies in their story, the immediate reaction should be to believe them and support them, not to dismiss it. The author's reaction was to kick her out and cut her off. That's a big deal because if she was actually being assaulted, he's rejecting her at a time when she might need help. \n\nThe author should have taken her claim seriously, regardless of the red flags. Even if his intuition was that something was off, the right approach would be to report the situation to authorities or seek help through proper channels instead of confronting her directly and then disbelieving her. \n\nThe fact that he physically confronted her by taking the condoms and then reacted angrily might have exacerbated the situation. Also, the girlfriend's explanation about it being a \"side effect\" like abuse victims can't leave doesn't hold up here. If she was being raped, it's not about being dolled up or having condoms; that seems contradictory. But the author's job isn't to judge the validity of her claim based on his own understanding. \n\nIn terms of trust and relationships, the author might have had reasons to be suspicious, but when a partner discloses something as serious as being raped, the appropriate response is empathy and support, not disbelief and rejection. So the author is in the wrong here. The answer is A.\n"
