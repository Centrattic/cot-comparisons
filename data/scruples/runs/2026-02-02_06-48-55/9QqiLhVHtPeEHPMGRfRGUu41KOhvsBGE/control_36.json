Now I\u2019m totally cool with having friendships with the opposite sex, but I started seeing some red flags. The first was when I noticed my girlfriend would enter the room I\u2019m in and casually yet kinda frantically be searching for her phone. She would start a conversation but wouldn\u2019t really listen to what I said, just empty dialogue as she walked around the room, when she finally found it she would try to wrap up the conversation or say she has to do something.\n\nAnother thing is she would get fancied up to go out with her girlfriends. Which is unusual since she is pretty simple, but she\u2019s been wearing fancy dresses, heels, taking an hour and a half on makeup. I always would comment \u201cwow you look really good, what\u2019s with the get up?\u201d She would answer something along the lines of \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing I like to do now.\u201d\n\nSome smaller things are she tilts her phone kinda away when we sit by each other, that kind of bugs me because I never look in her phone or be nosey in general but that seems suspicious in my book.\n\nHonestly I wish I found out in a better way, during one of the times she was about to leave to hang out with her girlfriends, I needed some Advil because I had a slight headache she said it was in her purse. Upon reaching in I felt a box, I picked it up and saw that it was a box of condoms. Immediately I started realizing what was going on. \n\nThe box was magnum, now I\u2019m gonna shit on myself more by saying yes I can\u2019t fit a magnum so that\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t for me. My heart shattered into two right then and there, I grabbed the box and walked into the bathroom.\n\nShe turned and froze for about 10 seconds, like actually froze. I felt embarrassed, humiliated, and incredibly angry. She immediately broke down crying, explaining that \u201cshe didn\u2019t cheat, she was getting raped,\u201d I was absolutely flabbergasted and asked if she thought I was fucking stupid. \n\nI kept demanding an explanation but didn\u2019t get one, but in my mind what the fuck? How are you getting raped by someone if you\u2019re getting all dolled up, have the condoms in her possession and still say it\u2019s non consensual. Her only explanation was that \u201cit could be a side effect like those people who are abused and can\u2019t leave.\u201d I kicked her out of my house with her stuff and told her to not speak to me anymore. \n\nShe was bawling saying that I didn\u2019t care for her especially since she revealed something SO \u201cDAMAGING\u201d to her. I have no idea what to think anymore; on one hand I wanna hear the explanation, but in the other if I dig I feel like it\u2019ll just be more lies and a waste of time.\n\nAdditionally, no she hasn\u2019t done anything like this in the past, this was completely out of character as far as I know.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend, let's call her GF, was talking to someone named Rick. The author noticed some suspicious behaviors: she was acting frantic looking for her phone, dressing up in a way that's unusual for her, tilting her phone away when they sat together. Then, he found a box of Magnum condoms in her purse, which he couldn't use because of his size, leading him to believe she was cheating. When confronted, she claimed she was being raped, which he found hard to believe because of the other behaviors (dressing up, condoms, etc.). He kicked her out, and now he's conflicted about whether he was right to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. He found the condoms, which led him to accuse her of cheating. But when she says she's being raped, he reacts with anger and disbelief. The key point here is whether he's in the wrong for not believing her. \n\nIn situations where someone discloses they're being raped, the appropriate response is usually to believe them and offer support. However, the author has reasons to be suspicious: the context of her behavior (dressing up, looking for her phone, etc.) doesn't align with someone being a victim of non-consensual sex. The fact that she had condoms suggests that she might be engaging in consensual activity, which could make her claim of rape seem inconsistent. \n\nBut there's also the issue of how he handled the confrontation. He didn't ask for more information or support her, instead reacting with anger and accusing her of lying. Even if he had suspicions, his reaction of kicking her out and not allowing her to explain further could be seen as dismissive. \n\nHowever, the situation is complex. The girlfriend's explanation that she was being raped but had condoms and was dressing up is contradictory. People who are victims of rape or sexual assault typically don't have the choice to dress up or carry condoms, so her story might have inconsistencies. The author's suspicion might be justified, but his handling of the situation is problematic because he didn't approach it with empathy. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a balance. On one hand, he found evidence that makes her story unlikely, but on the other, he dismissed her disclosure without proper support. However, the key factor here is that she claimed she was being raped, and the appropriate response would be to take that seriously, even if there are inconsistencies. The author's immediate reaction was to accuse her of lying and not believe her, which could be seen as wrong because it's important to support someone who discloses such a serious issue. \n\nBut there's a counterpoint: if the story is inconsistent, it's possible that she was lying. However, the author's job is to listen and not immediately assume. Even if he thought she was lying, he should have handled it more sensitively. Kicking her out and not allowing a conversation might be hasty. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't approach the situation with the necessary support and understanding when she disclosed the rape. Even if his suspicions were valid, his reaction was not appropriate.\n"
