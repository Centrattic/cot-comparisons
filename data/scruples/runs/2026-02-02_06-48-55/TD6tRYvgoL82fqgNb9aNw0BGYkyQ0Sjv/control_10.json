My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay over her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the parent's main argument is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment when their son is present. They mention that when their own son stays over, they make sure he's elsewhere. So they're concerned about supervision. But the daughter is 12, which is a common age for sleepovers, and the parent is okay with the friendship otherwise, just not the overnight stays.\n\nThe daughter's friend's parents threw a coming out party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent supports the friend's sexuality but feels the environment isn't safe. However, the parent hasn't provided specific reasons why the friend's home is unsafe beyond the presence of a sibling. \n\nThe parent might be conflating the friend's sexuality with safety concerns. The friend's family is likely aware of the need for appropriate supervision during sleepovers, especially with children. The parent's decision might be based on discomfort with the friend's sexual orientation, given their criticism of the coming out party as a \"shit show.\" This could indicate underlying prejudice, even if they claim to support the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. But if the safety concern is a pretext for discrimination, then the parent is in the wrong. The lack of specific safety issues (like past incidents) suggests the parent's reasoning might not be valid. Also, the daughter is close to her friend, and the parent's decision is causing her distress, which could harm their relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's real issue might be intolerance masked as concern for safety. Therefore, the parent is likely in the wrong.\n"
