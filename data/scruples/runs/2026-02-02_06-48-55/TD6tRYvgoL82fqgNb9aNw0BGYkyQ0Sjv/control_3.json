My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who\u4e0d\u8ba9 their 12-year-old daughter stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter's friend had a coming out party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent then decided not to allow overnight stays, leading to the daughter being upset and others accusing the parent of being intolerant.\n\nThe parent says they support the friend's sexuality but don't trust the friend's family's environment for their daughter. They also mention that they arrange their son to be elsewhere when the friend's daughter is over, citing safety. \n\nNow, to determine if the parent is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, the parent's reasoning is that the friend's family environment isn't safe, which is vague. The parent didn't specify any particular risks. On the other hand, the coming out party might be seen as a positive event for the friend, and the parent's reaction could be perceived as judgmental, even if they support the friend in general.\n\nThe parent claims to not be against the friendship, just the overnight stays. But the daughter is upset because her mom is interfering with their friendship. The parent's justification about safety is a bit unclear. They mention separating their son, which seems to be for the same reason, implying that they want to avoid mixed-gender situations? Or maybe to avoid any potential issues with the friend's family.\n\nIt's possible the parent has concerns about the friend's family being LGBTQ+ or the environment they represent. However, such a decision without clear safety concerns might come off as discriminatory. The parent's support for the friend's future happiness is mentioned, but actions here are conflicting with that support by limiting the friendship.\n\nIn many cases, such restrictions can be seen as overprotective or biased if not based on concrete safety issues. The parent might not be in the wrong legally, but socially or morally, there's a case to be made that they're being unsupportive of their daughter's friendship and the friend's identity. The daughter's age is 12, so their social interactions are important for development. The parent's decision could be seen as cutting off the daughter's support system, especially if the friend is a significant part of her life.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's reasoning is a bit shaky. They didn't provide specific safety issues, just a general discomfort with the coming out party. That could be the problem. So, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because their decision lacks clear justification beyond personal discomfort, which might not be a valid reason to restrict a child's friendships unless there's a concrete safety concern.\n"
