My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who doesn't allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The friend's family had a \"coming out party,\" which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent says they support the friend and aren't against the friendship but feel the friend's home isn't safe for an overnight stay. They also mention that they keep their son away when the daughter stays over, not due to distrust but for safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention wanting a safe environment for their daughter. But why do they think the friend's house is unsafe? The friend's family threw a coming out party, which the parent found trashy. The parent might be concerned about exposure to adult themes or inappropriate content, but at 12, kids are in middle school, and some families do have events like that. However, the parent's reasoning here is a bit shaky because the friend's sexuality doesn't inherently make the environment unsafe. The parent is conflating the celebration of a child's identity with something inappropriate, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nAlso, the parent isn't saying they don't support the friendship; they just don't want overnight stays. But the daughter is close to this friend, and the parent's decision is causing her emotional distress. The parent's justification about safety is vague. They don't provide specific reasons why the friend's house is unsafe, just their discomfort with the coming out party. Meanwhile, they take steps to ensure their son isn't around when their daughter is there, which suggests they might be more concerned about their own discomfort or societal norms rather than actual safety. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the parent's decision is based on legitimate safety concerns or prejudice. If the parent is genuinely worried about a specific issue, like drug use or unsafe conditions, that's different. But here, the parent's main issue is with the celebration of the daughter's friend's sexuality, which they find inappropriate. That seems more like a bias. Plus, the parent isn't cutting off the friendship entirely, just overnight visits. \n\nHowever, the parent's stance could be seen as not supporting their daughter's friend's identity, which is important for the daughter's emotional well-being. The parent claims support, but their actions might contradict that by limiting the daughter's autonomy and causing her distress. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many would argue that supporting a child's friendships, especially with someone who has come out, is important. The parent's decision could be viewed as not accepting the friend's family's decision to celebrate their child's identity. The parent's reasoning might be based on personal discomfort rather than actual risk, which could make their stance seem discriminatory. \n\nSo putting it all together, the parent's actions might be seen as in the wrong because they're making a judgment based on their discomfort with a family event that's about a child's identity, without concrete safety concerns. The parent is causing their daughter emotional harm and possibly alienating her friend's family. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
