My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The situation involves a 12-year-old girl whose best friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. Now, the parent is restricting their daughter from staying over there, and people are criticizing them as intolerant, but the parent claims they still support the friend and just want a safe environment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that they don't trust the friend's house to be a safe environment for their daughter. However, they also say they support the friend and her family. The key here is the definition of \"safe environment.\" The parent might be concerned about the friend's family being openly lesbian or the \"coming out\" party. But 12 is still a young age, and the parent might have other concerns, like the party's nature or their own discomfort with the celebration of sexuality at such a young age.\n\nBut the parent's justification is about safety, not the friend's sexuality. However, the parent's actions are based on the friend's family's orientation. Could there be an underlying bias here? The parent claims not to be intolerant, but their actions might be perceived as such. Also, the parent mentions making sure their son is elsewhere when the daughter stays over, which implies they're being cautious about their son's presence, but in this case, they're blocking the daughter from the friend's house. That seems inconsistent if the concern is about the son's presence.\n\nThe parent's reasoning for safety is a bit vague. They didn't specify any particular threat or unsafe behavior from the friend's family. If there were specific safety concerns, like the friend's parents being neglectful or having dangerous habits, that would be a valid reason. But the parent is focusing on the friend's sexuality and a party that they found trashy. That could indicate a bias against the friend's family's lifestyle, even if they claim support.\n\nAlso, the daughter is upset, and the parent is being criticized. The parent's justification might not hold up under scrutiny if there's no concrete safety issue. Society generally values supporting children's friendships and accepting peers' identities. The parent's actions could be seen as allowing personal discomfort with the friend's family's orientation to override their daughter's emotional well-being.\n\nBut the parent is within their rights to set boundaries for their child. However, if the reason is based on prejudice, even if unacknowledged, that would make them wrong. The line is between legitimate safety concerns and personal bias. Since the parent didn't present any specific safety issues, just a discomfort with the sexuality-related party, it's more likely a bias issue. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong because their decision is based on prejudice against the friend's family, not actual safety concerns.\n"
