My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter and her friend are very close, kindergartner friends. The friend's family threw a coming out party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent doesn't want their daughter to stay over there anymore, but claims they support the friend. The parent also mentions they make sure their son is out of the house when the daughter has friends over, to create a safe environment.\n\nSo, the parent is making a distinction between allowing the daughter to have friends over when they're there. But in this case, the parent is objecting to the daughter staying at the friend's house. The parent's reasoning is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment, but they don't specify why. The friend's family is a same-sex couple, and the parent is uncomfortable with the coming out party.\n\nNow, the parent says they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship, just the sleepovers. The parent might be worried about the daughter being in a same-sex household, maybe due to religious or personal beliefs. However, the parent's action is to restrict the daughter's social life based on the friend's parents' sexuality, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nBut the parent also mentions they ensure their own son isn't present during sleepovers, which is about providing a safe environment. Maybe the parent is uncomfortable with the friend's parents being same-sex, leading them to not trust their ability to manage a safe environment for their daughter. However, the parent doesn't provide any specific reasons why the friend's house isn't safe. \n\nIn terms of legality and social norms, in many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on sexual orientation. The parent's decision could be seen as a personal choice, but if it's based on the friend's parents' sexuality without valid reasons, it might be considered discriminatory. Also, the daughter is 12, so parents do have some control over their child's social activities, but if it's based on prejudice, that's a different matter.\n\nThe parent claims they support the friend, so the issue isn't about the friend's sexuality but perhaps the parent's own discomfort with the friend's parents. The coming out party might have triggered the parent's discomfort, leading them to restrict the daughter's visits. However, the parent is not opposing the friendship itself, just the sleepovers. \n\nIn terms of the daughter's well-being, being close friends and suddenly having sleepovers canceled could affect her emotionally. The parent's reasoning might not be justified, especially if there's no evidence the friend's house is unsafe. The parent's own actions (making their son leave) are about safety, but the same standard isn't applied to the friend's house, which could be unfair.\n\nSo, the parent's decision is based on the friend's parents' sexuality and a coming out party, which might indicate a lack of acceptance of LGBTQ+ families. Even if the parent claims support, the action here could be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the answer might be that the parent is in the wrong (A), but I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. The parent isn't ending the friendship, just limiting sleepovers. However, the underlying reason could be prejudice, making it wrong. Alternatively, if the parent had valid safety concerns unrelated to sexuality, it would be different. Since the parent didn't provide specific safety issues, it's likely about their own discomfort, hence A.\n"
