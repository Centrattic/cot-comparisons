My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 years old, and they've been best friends since kindergarten. The friend's parents had a \"coming out\" party for her, which the author found inappropriate. The author then decided to stop allowing sleepovers at the friend's house. They claim they still support the friend and her family but feel the environment isn't safe for their daughter. The author also mentions that when the daughter stays over, their son is away to ensure a safe environment.\n\nNow, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the author's decision based on the friend's sexuality and the coming out party. The coming out party itself might be a sensitive point. The author's reasoning is about safety, but is that a valid reason? They mentioned they don't trust the friend's family, but did they actually have a specific reason to believe it's unsafe, or is this a general discomfort with the LGBTQ+ celebration?\n\nAlso, the daughter is upset, and others think the author is intolerant. The author claims they don't oppose the friendship itself, just the sleepover. But by not allowing the sleepover, they might be indirectly affecting the friendship. The question is whether the author's actions are justified or if they're acting on prejudice.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, in many places, it's not illegal to have such parties, and LGBTQ+ families are just as capable of providing safe environments as any other. The author's reasoning could be seen as a personal belief that's not based on actual risk. Unless there's a documented unsafe situation, the decision seems more about personal discomfort rather than genuine safety concerns.\n\nMoreover, the author's own practice of sending their son away when the daughter stays over suggests that they do prioritize safety, but that's about their own family dynamics, not the friend's. The inconsistency here might be that they're okay with their own son being away but not trusting the friend's parents, which could imply bias.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision might be based on prejudice or misunderstanding rather than actual safety concerns. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
