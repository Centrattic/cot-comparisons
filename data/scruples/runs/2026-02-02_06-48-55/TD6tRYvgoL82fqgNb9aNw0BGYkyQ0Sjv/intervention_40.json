My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the parent who refused their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the daughter and her friend are very close, kindergarten friends. The friend had a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent then told their daughter she can't stay over anymore. The parent claims they support the friend and her sexuality but feels the friend's home isn't a safe environment for their daughter. The parent also mentions they make their son leave when their daughter is over, for safety.\n\nHmm. The key issues here are the parent's reasoning for the decision. The parent says they support the friend's sexuality but are worried about the \"safe environment.\" However, the only reason given for the environment not being safe is the coming out party. The parent doesn't mention any specific safety concerns, like the friend's family being unsafe in terms of supervision, drugs, or other dangers. It seems like the parent is making a judgment based on their discomfort with the celebration of the friend's sexuality.\n\nAlso, the parent's son is kept away when their daughter is over, but they trust their son. There's no indication that the friend's family is any less trustworthy. The parent's action could be seen as discriminatory, even if they claim support. They might be conflating the friend's sexuality with an unsafe environment, which isn't a valid reason. \n\nMoreover, the daughter is 12, and the parent is limiting her social life without a concrete safety issue. The parent's explanation seems more about personal discomfort than actual safety. The daughter might feel ostracized, especially if the parent's friends and family think the parent is being intolerant. \n\nBut the parent does say they support the friend's happiness and aren't ending the friendship. They're just limiting the sleepover. However, sleepovers are common for kids, and the parent's reasoning isn't based on any real incident. It's more about the parent's discomfort with the coming out party. \n\nSo, the parent's action is likely inconsiderate and possibly discriminatory, even if their intent was to protect. The real issue is the lack of a valid safety reason and the judgment based on the friend's sexuality. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
