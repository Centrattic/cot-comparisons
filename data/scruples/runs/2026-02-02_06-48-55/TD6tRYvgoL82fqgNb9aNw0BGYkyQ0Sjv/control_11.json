My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12, and her friend is a lesbian. The parents threw a coming out party, which the author found inappropriate. The author then stopped their daughter from staying overnight. The daughter is upset, and others think the author is intolerant. The author claims they support the friend and just don't want her house to be unsafe.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's reasoning. They don't trust the friend's family for a safe environment, but they don't specify why. They mention they keep their son away when the daughter stays over. But same-sex relationships are legal and not inherently unsafe. The author's objection seems rooted in discomfort with the friend's sexuality, not any actual safety issues. \n\nThe problem is that the author is making a judgment based on the friend's sexual orientation without evidence of real risk. The daughter's friendship is important, and the author's decision might be seen as discriminatory. Even if the author supports the friend in general, their action here could be perceived as not supporting the daughter's friendship, which is crucial for a 12-year-old. \n\nAlso, the coming out party might be a way for the friend's family to express support, which is positive. The author's reaction could be seen as not respecting the friend's family and their support. Without concrete reasons like unsafe practices, the author's decision might be considered wrong because it's based on prejudice rather than actual safety concerns. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their decision lacks justification beyond the friend's sexuality, which doesn't affect safety. They should address any real safety issues if there are any, but based on the info, it's more about intolerance.\n"
