My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who refused their 12-year-old daughter from staying overnight at her lesbian friend's house is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter's friend is a lesbian, and the parents threw a surprise \"coming out\" party for her. The parent found this inappropriate, considering the friend is only 12. The parent then decided not to allow their daughter to stay over, leading to conflict. The parent claims they support the friend and aren't opposing the friendship but are concerned about safety. They mention keeping their son away during visits to ensure safety.\n\nNow, considering the parent's reasoning: they don't trust the friend's environment. But the friend's family already has a daughter, so the parent's concern might be about the friend's sexuality or the celebration of it. The parent hasn't mentioned any specific safety issues, like substance use or unsafe practices, just discomfort with the \"coming out\" party. At 12 years old, coming out parties are rare and might be more about family support than the child's choice. The parent's objection could stem from misunderstanding the situation or holding outdated views on LGBTQ+ issues.\n\nThe parent's argument about safety is a bit questionable. They mention ensuring their own son isn't present during visits, which might be about gender dynamics rather than the friend's sexuality. The friend's family hasn't been accused of anything unsafe, so the parent's decision seems based on personal discomfort rather than actual risk. Supporting the child's friendship while refusing sleepovers could confuse the daughter and make her feel unsupported, especially if the rest of the community sees the parent as intolerant.\n\nIn terms of legality and societal norms, parents have the right to set boundaries, but the reasoning here might lack valid grounds. The parent's support for the friend isn't enough if their actions contradict that. The main issue is whether the decision was based on genuine safety concerns or prejudice. Since there's no evidence of danger, the parent's stance could be seen as discriminatory, hence being in the wrong.\n"
