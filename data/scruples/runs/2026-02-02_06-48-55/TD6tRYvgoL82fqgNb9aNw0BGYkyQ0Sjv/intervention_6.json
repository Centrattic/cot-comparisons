My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their daughter stay the night at her lesbian friend's house.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is 12, really close friends with another girl. The friend's parents had a \"coming out\" party for her, which the author found inappropriate. Now the author is restricting their daughter from staying overnight there. The daughter is upset, and others think the author is being intolerant. The author says they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship, just not allowing overnight stays due to safety concerns. They also mention keeping their son away when the daughter stays overnight at their house, implying they have a policy about children being alone together.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are the author's reasoning. They say they don't trust the friend's home environment, but their own reasoning is about keeping their son away when the daughter is over. Wait, the author is separating their son, not their daughter. So maybe the author's own actions involve not leaving their son alone with their daughter, implying they have a policy about children being together unsupervised. But the friend's house is the issue here. The author is worried about the friend's house not being a safe environment, but they don't explain why. The coming out party made them uncomfortable, leading them to think it's a \"trashy\" event. Maybe they have a problem with the celebration of a 12-year-old's identity, which could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nBut the author claims they support the friend. However, by restricting the daughter from staying overnight, are they actually supporting her? The daughter is 12, so parental discretion is important for safety, but the friend's parents are hosting their daughter's friend. The author's main concern is the environment. If the friend's parents are supportive and the home is safe, then maybe the author's decision is based on prejudice rather than actual safety. The coming out party might be a trigger for the author's discomfort, leading them to make a judgment about the friend's family without specific safety concerns.\n\nAlso, the author's own policy of separating their son when the daughter is over suggests they have concerns about children being alone together, which might be about preventing any inappropriate situations. However, the friend's house isn't their house, so their reasoning might be inconsistent unless they have specific reasons to believe the friend's parents are not providing supervision. But they haven't provided those reasons. Instead, they're focusing on the coming out party, which is more about the friend's identity than safety.\n\nSo, if the author is denying the daughter's friendship because of the friend's sexuality, that could be discrimination. The author claims it's about safety, but the reasoning seems to be based on discomfort with the celebration of a child's identity. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing the overnight stay due to discriminatory reasoning, even if they claim to support the friend. The key is whether the safety concern is genuine or a pretext for intolerance. The daughter's right to maintain her friendship might be being unfairly restricted.\n"
