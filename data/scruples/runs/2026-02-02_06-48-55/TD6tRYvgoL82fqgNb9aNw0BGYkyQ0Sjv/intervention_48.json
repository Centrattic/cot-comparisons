My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions that they support the friend and even attended her coming-out party, which they found a bit over the top. The parent's reasoning is that they don't want to trust the friend's family to provide a safe environment, so they keep their son away when the daughter is over. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be concerned about their daughter's safety, but the reasoning seems a bit off. The parent says they make sure their son is elsewhere when the daughter stays over, implying they trust their own son but not the friend's family. That could be a red flag because it's a double standard. Also, the parent is separating the children based on the friend's sexuality, which might be a form of implicit bias.\n\nThen there's the daughter's friendship aspect. The daughter is close to her friend, and the parent's decision is causing conflict. The parent claims they're not against the friendship, just the sleepovers. But the daughter might feel punished or embarrassed, which could affect her social life and mental health.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations come into play. In many places, as long as the friend's home is a safe environment, parents can't discriminate based on sexual orientation. The parent's reasoning for safety is questionable. They might be using that as an excuse to avoid dealing with the friend's sexuality, which could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the parent's statement about the coming-out party being a \"shit show\" might indicate discomfort with the friend's identity, even if they claim to support her. This could lead to the daughter feeling conflicted between her friendship and her parent's views.\n\nI should also think about the age of the children. At 12, sleepovers are common and part of social development. Restricting them without a valid reason could hinder the daughter's ability to build trust and independence.\n\nIn conclusion, while parents do have the right to set boundaries, the parent's actions here seem to be based on prejudice rather than genuine safety concerns. The double standard and the daughter's emotional well-being are key factors. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong here.\n"
