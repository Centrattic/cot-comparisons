My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the parent who stopped their 12-year-old daughter from staying over her lesbian friend's house is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for the friend. The parent found it inappropriate for a 12-year-old, calling it a \"shit show\" and \"trashy.\" They then decided not to let their daughter stay overnight there. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is intolerant. The parent clarifies they support the friend and her sexuality but are concerned about the environment being unsafe.\n\nSo, the parent's reasoning is about safety. They mention that when their daughter stays over, they make sure their son isn't home. They don't trust their own son, but do they apply that same logic to the friend's household? If the parent is worried about their son's presence affecting their daughter's safety, then the same concern might apply to the friend's home if there are other factors they're not comfortable with. However, the parent's justification for the friend's house is different. They might be conflating the friend's sexuality with the environment being unsafe, which could be a problem. \n\nBut then again, maybe the parent has other specific concerns about the friend's home. However, the parent doesn't provide details about what made the \"coming out\" party inappropriate. Maybe they think that celebrating sexuality at a young age is wrong, which could be a bias. Also, the parent says they don't want to terminate the friendship, just the overnight stays. \n\nSo, the key points are: the parent's decision is based on safety, but is that a valid reason? If the parent can't specify why the friend's home is unsafe beyond the friend's sexuality, then it could be seen as discriminatory. On the other hand, if the parent has legitimate safety concerns (like other factors in the friend's home), then it's a different story. But since the parent doesn't mention other issues, it might just be about the friend's sexuality, which would be a problem. \n\nAlso, the parent is making a distinction between their own home (where they control the environment) and the friend's home. But if the friend's home's environment is perceived as unsafe because of the family's focus on the daughter's sexuality, maybe the parent feels uncomfortable. However, that could be a prejudice. \n\nIn terms of age, 12 is young, and parents might have different opinions on when to celebrate such things. But the parent's issue isn't with the daughter's friend's sexuality per se, but the environment. However, the parent's reasoning might be conflating the two. \n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong if their decision is based on a bias against the friend's sexuality, even if they claim it's about safety. Without specific safety concerns beyond the friend's family's celebration of their child's sexuality, it could be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the answer might be A, the parent is in the wrong. But maybe not, if they have genuine safety concerns. However, the parent's explanation doesn't provide those details, so it's more likely A.\n"
