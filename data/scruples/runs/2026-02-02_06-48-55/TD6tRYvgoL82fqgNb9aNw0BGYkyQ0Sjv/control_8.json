My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which they found inappropriate. The parent claims they support the friend and her daughter's sexuality but are concerned about the safety of their own child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel that the environment at the friend's house, despite being supportive, isn't safe for their daughter. They mention making their son leave the house when the daughter stays over. However, in this case, they're not allowing the daughter to go to the friend's house. The parent's reasoning is about safety, but is that a valid concern here?\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter and her friend are close, and the parent is imposing a restriction that's causing conflict. The parent claims they're not against the friendship but are against the overnight stay. However, the daughter might feel that her parent is being discriminatory, especially if the friend's family is supportive of their daughter's sexuality. The parent's support might not align with their actions.\n\nLegally and socially, as long as the friend's family is providing a safe environment, the parent's refusal could be seen as an overreaction. The \"coming out\" party might have been a cultural or personal choice of the friend's family, not necessarily a threat. The parent's concerns about safety might be subjective. Unless there's evidence that the friend's home is unsafe, the parent's decision could be based on personal discomfort rather than actual risk.\n\nAlso, the daughter is in a situation where her parent's actions are affecting her social life. The parent's justification about creating a safe environment at home when the daughter stays over might not be the same as the friend's home. However, the parent isn't allowing the daughter to go to the friend's house at all, which could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, supporting a child's friend's sexuality is important. The parent's actions might be perceived as intolerant, even if they claim support. The key is whether the decision is based on genuine safety concerns or personal bias. Since the parent hasn't provided specific reasons about the friend's home being unsafe, it's hard to validate their concerns. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for making a decision that limits their daughter's social interactions based on their own discomfort rather than actual risk.\n"
