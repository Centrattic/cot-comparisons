My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent deciding that their 12-year-old daughter can't stay the night at her friend's house because the friend's family is celebrating their daughter's \"coming out\" as lesbian. The parent claims they don't want to terminate the friendship but feel the friend's home isn't a safe environment for their daughter. They also mention that when their daughter stays over, their son is elsewhere, not because they don't trust him, but to ensure safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. The parent might be uncomfortable with the celebration of their friend's daughter's sexuality, but they clarify they support the girl and her happiness. The parent's main issue is about the safety of their daughter during overnight stays. However, the parent doesn't provide specific reasons why they think the friend's home is unsafe. The only reason given is the \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. \n\nNow, societal norms and legal aspects come into play. In many places, parents have the right to decide where their children can stay overnight, especially when they have concerns. However, the parent is facing backlash for being intolerant. The key here is whether the parent's concerns are valid. The friend's family is celebrating their daughter's sexuality, which is a positive and supportive act. The parent's decision seems based on a personal discomfort with the celebration rather than any concrete safety issues. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions that when their daughter stays over, their son is elsewhere. This might be an attempt to provide a safe environment, but it's not directly related to the friend's family's orientation. The parent's reasoning could be seen as using safety as a cover for their discomfort with the friend's family's celebration. \n\nIn terms of the daughter's age, 12 is a young age, but friendships are important. The parent is limiting the daughter's social life without a clear safety justification. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is being intolerant. The parent's stance could be viewed as discriminatory, even if they claim to support the friend's daughter. \n\nI should also consider if there's any legal aspect, but since the parent is making a decision based on their own judgment, unless there's a legal issue (like child endangerment), the parent's right to make such a decision might be within their parental discretion. However, the community's perspective often matters here. The parent is facing social backlash, which suggests that many see the decision as unjust.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's reasoning is based more on personal discomfort rather than a genuine safety concern. The friend's family is simply celebrating their daughter's identity. Therefore, the parent is likely in the wrong (Answer A) because the decision seems to stem from intolerance rather than valid safety reasons.\n"
