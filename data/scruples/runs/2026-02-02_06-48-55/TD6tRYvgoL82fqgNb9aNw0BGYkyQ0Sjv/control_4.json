My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for not letting their daughter stay at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's main reasoning is about safety, specifically mentioning that when the daughter stays over, they send their son elsewhere to ensure safety. The parent also mentions disliking the \"coming out\" party, thinking it was inappropriate for a 12-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. Both are 12, so they're in middle school. The parent is concerned about the friend's family environment being unsafe. However, the parent doesn't specify what makes it unsafe. They mention their own practice of separating their children when the daughter stays over, which implies they take safety seriously. But the friend's family environment being unsafe isn't explained\u2014maybe the parent is making assumptions based on the friend's sexuality?\n\nNext, the parent says they support the friend and wish her happiness but don't want their daughter there. This could be seen as a misunderstanding or a form of prejudice. The coming out party was a family event to show support, which is common these days. The parent's reaction might come across as judgmental, even if they claim not to be intolerant.\n\nLegally, unless there's a specific safety concern (like a history of abuse or something), a parent can choose where their child stays. But socially, the parent's stance might be viewed as discriminatory, especially if they're not providing concrete reasons for the safety concern. The parent's own actions (sending their son away) show they prioritize safety, but applying that to the friend's house without clear evidence could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction is important. The parent's decision is causing the daughter to hate them, which might indicate that the parent's approach is not age-appropriate or respectful of the daughter's feelings. At 12, children often value their friendships highly, so a sudden restriction without explanation can be hurtful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent has the right to make decisions about their child's safety, the lack of specific safety concerns from the friend's house and the judgmental reaction to the coming out party might place the parent in the wrong. The parent's actions could be seen as discriminatory or based on prejudice rather than legitimate safety issues. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
