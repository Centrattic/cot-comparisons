My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the parent is refusing to let their 12-year-old daughter stay the night at her friend's house, whose parents are lesbian. The daughter and friend are close since kindergarten.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions they support the friend's sexuality and want her to be happy. But they don't like the \"coming out\" party, thinking it's inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent's reasoning for not allowing the sleepover is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment. Also, when their daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere, not because they don't trust him, but to provide a safe environment.\n\nHmm. The parent's justification is about safety. But the friend's family is lesbian, so does that make the environment unsafe? The parent isn't providing specific reasons why the friend's home is unsafe. Maybe they're conflating their discomfort with the family's sexuality with safety concerns? That could be a problem. Also, the parent allows their son to stay over at friends' houses but ensures their son isn't there when the daughter is hosting. That seems like a double standard\u2014maybe the parent is uncomfortable with same-sex dynamics but not opposite-sex ones?\n\nThe daughter is upset because her friend is lesbian, and the parent is seen as unsupportive. However, the parent claims they support the friend. But their actions are restricting the friendship. There's a difference between supporting someone's identity and being comfortable with their family structure. The parent might be projecting their own discomfort onto safety issues.\n\nBut legally and socially, same-sex parents are just as capable of providing a safe environment. The parent's decision might be based on prejudice rather than actual safety concerns. The \"coming out\" party at 12 seems young, but the parent's issue with that event might not be relevant to the safety of the friend's home. The parent's reasoning is vague\u2014what makes the environment unsafe? No specifics are given, just assumptions based on sexuality.\n\nSo, the parent's actions are affecting the daughter's friendship without valid safety concerns. The parent's justification might be a cover for their own biases. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for allowing prejudice to influence their decision, even if they claim to support the friend.\n"
