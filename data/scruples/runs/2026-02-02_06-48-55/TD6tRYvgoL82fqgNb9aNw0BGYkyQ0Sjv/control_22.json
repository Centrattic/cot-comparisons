My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who wrote the post is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house.\n\nFirst, the daughter and her friend are very close, inseparable since kindergarten. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for her daughter. The parent finds this premature and inappropriate for a 12-year-old, thinking it's celebrating the child's sexuality too early. The parent then tells their daughter she can't stay overnight anymore. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is intolerant and unsupportive. The parent clarifies they still support the friend and her family but are concerned about the safety of their daughter during overnight stays, mentioning they also separate their son during such visits.\n\nSo, the key points here: the parent's decision is based on two things\u2014discomfort with the \"coming out\" party and safety concerns. The parent says they support the friend's family and isn't ending the friendship. They also mention their own safety measures when their daughter has friends over.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and legal aspects. At 12, a child's sexuality is a sensitive topic. The parent's objection might stem from personal beliefs about when to address such issues. However, the daughter is forming her own relationships, and the parent's decision could be seen as imposing their views on their child's social life. \n\nThe parent's safety concern is another angle. They might not trust the friend's family's environment, but they don't specify any actual risk. The mention of separating their son during overnight stays for safety could imply a general policy rather than a specific threat. If there's no evidence of danger, the parent's decision could be based on prejudice or misunderstanding.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children. However, if the friend's family is providing a safe environment and the parent's refusal is based on the child's sexual orientation, it could be seen as discriminatory. The parent claims to support the friend's happiness but is restricting their daughter's social interactions. This could be viewed as inconsistent, as supporting a friend's identity while limiting their association could be hurtful to the child and the friend.\n\nAdditionally, the parent's reasoning about the \"coming out\" party might reflect their own discomfort with LGBTQ+ issues. The term \"coming out\" at 12 might be used here differently\u2014maybe the party was celebratory but the parent interprets it as premature. The parent's judgment about the appropriateness of such a celebration could be biased.\n\nIn terms of the daughter's well-being, restricting her close friendship could lead to feelings of betrayal, especially if the parent is seen as not supporting her friend's identity. The daughter might feel caught between her friend and her parent, affecting her trust and emotional health.\n\nThe parent's safety concerns, while mentioned, are vague. If there's no specific reason to believe the environment is unsafe, the decision might be based on stereotypes or fear rather than actual risk. This could be considered in the wrong because it's limiting the child's autonomy and friendship without valid grounds.\n\nOn the other hand, parents have the right to make decisions they believe protect their child. However, if those decisions are based on the child's sexual orientation and not on any actual safety issues, it could be seen as discriminatory. The parent's actions might be more about their own discomfort than the child's best interest.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent might be in the wrong if their decision is based on prejudice against the friend's family's sexuality rather than a legitimate safety concern. The daughter's right to maintain a close friendship and the parent's apparent support for the friend's happiness conflict with their restriction on overnight visits. The parent's reasoning about the \"coming out\" party suggests a lack of understanding or acceptance, which could make their decision unjust.\n"
