My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not letting their daughter stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the parent's daughter is 12 and very close to her friend. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent then decided their daughter couldn't stay over there anymore. The parent says they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship, but they feel the environment isn't safe. They also mention that when their daughter stays over, they move their son out to ensure safety.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the parent's reasoning. The parent is concerned about the safety of their daughter at the friend's house, possibly due to the friend's family dynamics. But they also mention that the party was a \"shit show\" and questioned celebrating a child's sexuality. That might come off as judgmental or not supportive, even if they claim to support the friend in general. \n\nThe parent's stated reason is safety, but the example given is about the coming out party. It's possible that the parent's real concern isn't safety but discomfort with the friend's sexuality. The parent also mentions moving their son out when the daughter stays over, which is about providing a safe environment, but that's their own home. So their reasoning for the friend's house might be different.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, if the safety concern is a pretext for discrimination or intolerance, then that's a different issue. The parent's public reaction to the party suggests they might not be fully supportive, which could affect the daughter's feelings.\n\nAlso, considering the daughter is 12, it's important that the parent supports her social life unless there's a real safety issue. The parent says they don't oppose the friendship but the friend's house isn't safe. But the friend's family might not see it that way. The parent hasn't provided specific safety issues beyond the party, which could be a red flag.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If their concern is genuine safety, maybe not, but if it's a cover for intolerance, then yes. The parent's justification seems a bit shaky without concrete safety issues. The community might see this as discriminatory, especially if the friend's family is openly supportive. The parent's own actions (moving their son) show they prioritize safety, but that's in their own home. The friend's home's safety isn't clearly demonstrated here. \n\nI think the parent might be using safety as an excuse to avoid the friend's sexuality, which would make them wrong. The answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because the reasoning isn't solid and could be seen as discriminatory despite claims of support.\n"
