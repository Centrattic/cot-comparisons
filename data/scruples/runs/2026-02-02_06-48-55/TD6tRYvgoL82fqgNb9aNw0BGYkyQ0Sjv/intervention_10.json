My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent who doesn't allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her friend's house because the friend is a lesbian. The friend's family threw a \"coming out party,\" which the author found inappropriate for a child's sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social context. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's activities, including who they interact with. However, the key issue here might be the reasoning behind the decision. The author claims they're not being intolerant but wants to provide a safe environment. However, the daughter is 12, and friendships at that age are important for social development. \n\nThe author mentions that the friend's family is lesbian, and the coming out party made them uncomfortable. But the daughter's friend is a 12-year-old, so the \"coming out\" part might be a misunderstanding. At that age, children are just starting to explore identity, and a coming out party for a 12-year-old to their friends might not be about sexual orientation but maybe about being open about their identity in a different way. \n\nAlso, the author says they don't want to terminate the friendship, just the overnight stays. The parent is worried about the environment, but they don't provide a specific reason why the friend's home is unsafe. The author mentions they keep their son away when the daughter stays over, which is about safety, but the issue here is the friend's family. \n\nThe parent's reasoning seems to be based on discomfort with the friend's family being lesbian, which could be a bias. Even if they claim to be supportive, the action of not allowing the stay might be based on prejudice. The daughter is being punished for her friend's family's sexuality, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nHowever, the parent has a right to decide about their child's safety. If the parent truly believed there was a risk, they might have a case, but the problem is the lack of concrete evidence of a safe environment. The parent's justification seems more about their own discomfort than an actual threat. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent is likely in the wrong because they're denying their child a social experience based on the friend's family's sexuality without a valid safety concern, which could be seen as discriminatory and harmful to the child's well-being and friendship.\n"
