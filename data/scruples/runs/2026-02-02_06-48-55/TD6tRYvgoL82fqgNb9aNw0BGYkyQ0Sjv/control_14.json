My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The situation involves some complex family dynamics and personal beliefs.\n\nFirst, the author's daughter is 12 and very close to her best friend, who is lesbian. The friend's family had a \"coming out party\" for her, which the author found inappropriate, calling it a \"shit show\" and \"trashy.\" The author then decided their daughter shouldn't stay overnight there. People are now criticizing the author as intolerant, but the author claims they support the friend and just don't want to ensure a \"safe environment.\"\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's safety and where they can socialize. However, the author's reasoning seems to mix personal discomfort with a public celebration of sexuality with concerns about safety. The key here is whether the author's decision is based on legitimate safety concerns or personal prejudice.\n\nThe author mentions that when the daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere. This suggests a possible double standard. If the author is concerned about their son's presence affecting the daughter's safety, but the friend's family's environment is now a problem, it might indicate that the author's concern isn't about the friend's family but about the friend's sexuality. The coming out party was a family event, but that doesn't necessarily make the home an unsafe place for a child. The author's justification for the \"safe environment\" might not hold up if there's no evidence of actual risk.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, which is a time when peer relationships are crucial. Cutting off a close friendship could harm the daughter emotionally. The author is being criticized for intolerance, which might be valid if the decision is based on prejudice against a lesbian family. The author claims support but the action contradicts that by limiting the daughter's social life based on the friend's family's orientation.\n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to make such decisions if they genuinely believe a situation is unsafe. However, the author's reasoning seems more about discomfort with the friend's family's choice to celebrate their sexuality than an actual safety issue. The \"safe environment\" argument might be a way to justify personal bias without concrete evidence of danger.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision appears to be based on prejudice rather than legitimate safety concerns. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
