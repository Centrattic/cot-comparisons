My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a parent who doesn't allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her friend's house. The friend is lesbian, and the parents threw a \"coming out\" party for her, which the author found inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter and her friend have been close since kindergarten, almost inseparable. The issue arises after the coming out party. The author's reasoning is that they don't want their daughter to stay at the friend's house, citing a \"safe environment.\" They mention that when the daughter stays over, their son is sent elsewhere for safety. The author insists they support the friend's sexuality but don't trust the friend's family to ensure safety.\n\nHmm. The author's main argument is about safety. But wait, the friend's family threw a coming out party, which is a celebration of the daughter's friend's identity. The author seems to think that because the friend is lesbian, the environment isn't safe for their daughter. That might imply some underlying prejudice or discomfort with the friend's sexuality. \n\nBut the author says they support the friend's happiness. However, their action of not allowing an overnight stay could be seen as conflicting with that support. The daughter is upset, and others think the author is intolerant. The question is whether the author's decision is justified or not.\n\nSafety is a valid concern for parents. However, the author's son is sent away when the daughter stays over, which suggests they're more concerned about their son's safety than their daughter's when she's at the friend's house. That seems inconsistent unless there's another factor. The author hasn't mentioned any specific safety concerns at the friend's house, like unsafe living conditions or risky behavior. The coming out party being a \"shit show\" might be a personal opinion, not a legitimate safety issue.\n\nSo, if there's no actual safety risk identified, but the author is making a decision based on the friend's sexuality, that could be discriminatory. The parent is allowing their son to avoid being around the daughter's friend, which might be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes or fear based on the friend's identity. Even if the author supports the friend's happiness, not allowing the daughter to have an overnight stay without a clear safety reason could be perceived as unsupportive behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the daughter is 12 years old, and friends are important for social development. Restricting her based on the friend's sexuality might harm the daughter's relationship with her friend and her perception of what's acceptable. The parent's explanation about safety doesn't hold up if there's no evidence of the friend's house being unsafe. The coming out party's celebration is a rite of support, not a threat. So the author's reasoning might be a way to justify prejudice without acknowledging it.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their decision is based on the friend's sexuality without valid safety concerns, which can be seen as discriminatory and harmful to the daughter's relationship and the friend's family.\n"
