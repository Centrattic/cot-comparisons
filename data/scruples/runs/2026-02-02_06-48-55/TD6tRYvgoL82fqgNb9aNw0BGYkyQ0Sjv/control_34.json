My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent deciding their 12-year-old daughter can't stay over her lesbian friend's house. The daughter and friend have been close since kindergarten, and the friend's family had a \"coming out\" party for her. The parent thinks the party was inappropriate for a 12-year-old and now is restricting sleepovers there. The parent claims they still support the friend and aren't ending the friendship, just not allowing sleepovers due to safety concerns, similar to how they manage their son's sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the parent is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The parent's main argument is that the friend's house isn't a safe environment for their daughter, citing the \"coming out\" party as a reason. But the friend is 12 years old, so the party might be more about the parents showing support rather than the child's sexuality. The parent might feel uncomfortable with the public celebration of a child's identity, even if they support the friend. However, the parent is allowing their son to stay over friends' houses but requires him to be elsewhere when the daughter is over. That seems like a double standard, which could be a problem.\n\nThe parent is not opposing the friendship but is restricting sleepovers. The key issue here is whether the parent's decision is justified. The parent's reasoning about safety is a bit unclear. If the friend's house is considered unsafe because of the party, but there's no evidence of actual danger, then the parent's concern might be based on personal discomfort rather than genuine safety. Also, the parent isn't providing a clear reason for the safety concern, just mentioning the party felt \"trashy.\" \n\nIn terms of supporting the daughter's friend, the parent says they support her, but the action of restricting sleepovers could be seen as not supporting the friend's family or the daughter's autonomy in her friendship. At 12, children are forming close friendships, and restricting sleepovers without clear safety reasons might strain the relationship. The parent's approach could come across as judgmental, even if they claim not to be. \n\nThe parent's own behavior with their son\u2014making him leave when the daughter is over\u2014might also be a red flag. If they have a policy about siblings being separated during sleepovers, maybe there's an underlying issue they're not addressing. However, the question is about the daughter's sleepover at the friend's house. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent's reasoning seems more based on personal discomfort with the \"coming out\" party rather than actual safety. The parent is not supporting the daughter's close friendship by limiting her social interactions. The AITA community often values supporting children's friendships unless there's a real safety issue. Since the parent hasn't provided concrete safety concerns, just their own disapproval of the party, they might be in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the decision seems to stem from personal bias rather than valid safety concerns.\n"
