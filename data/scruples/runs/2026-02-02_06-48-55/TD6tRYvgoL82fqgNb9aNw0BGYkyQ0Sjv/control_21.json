My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the parent is refusing to let their 12-year-old daughter stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The daughter and her best friend are really close, having been friends since kindergarten. The friend's family threw a coming out party, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent explains that they're not against the friend's sexuality but don't want their daughter to stay overnight because they can't guarantee a safe environment. They also mention that when the daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere, not because they don't trust him, but to provide a safe space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They say they support the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the safety of their daughter. However, the parent's justification for safety might be a bit confusing. If they're okay with their daughter being at the friend's house during the day but not overnight, maybe they're worried about something specific happening at night? But they don't elaborate on what the safety issues are. The coming out party is described as a \"shit show,\" which might reflect the parent's discomfort with the celebration rather than any actual safety hazard.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the parent making their son leave the house when the daughter stays over. That seems like a standard safety measure, but it's not entirely clear how that relates to the friend's house. Maybe the parent is projecting their own family's safety measures onto the friend's home, assuming that the friend's house isn't as safe. However, the parent doesn't provide concrete reasons why the friend's house is unsafe, just that they feel it's not a safe environment. That's a bit vague.\n\nThe daughter is upset because she can't stay over, and others think the parent is being intolerant. The parent insists they're supportive. But the parent's actions are cutting off the daughter from her best friend, which could harm the daughter's relationships and feelings. Even if the parent's intention is to protect, the method might be misguided. The parent hasn't communicated specific safety concerns to the other family, which might lead to misunderstandings. \n\nAlso, at 12 years old, children are forming their own identities and friendships. Restricting a close friendship without clear reasons could be seen as overprotective or based on the parent's personal discomfort rather than actual risk. The coming out party being a \"trashy\" event suggests the parent might have a negative view of LGBTQ+ celebrations, even though they claim to support the friend. This inconsistency could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. If there were specific safety concerns, like the friend's parents being unsafe or the environment being harmful, that would be different. But since the parent hasn't provided those details, it's hard to justify the decision based on safety. It might come down to the parent's personal beliefs rather than the actual circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's reasoning seems more rooted in discomfort with the friend's sexuality and the coming out party rather than genuine safety issues. By not allowing the daughter to stay over, they're potentially damaging her friendships and not providing a solid reason. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong because their actions are based on personal intolerance rather than legitimate safety concerns.\n"
