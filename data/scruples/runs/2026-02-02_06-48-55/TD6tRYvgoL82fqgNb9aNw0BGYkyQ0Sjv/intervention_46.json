My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (a parent) is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning is that the friend's family might not be providing a safe environment, comparing it to how they keep their son away when the daughter stays over. They mention supporting the friend and not being intolerant, but the situation has caused tension with the daughter and others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be concerned about safety, but what exactly is the basis for that concern? They didn't mention any specific incidents that made them feel unsafe. Instead, they reacted to the \"coming out\" party, which they found off-putting. The parent's justification is that they want to ensure a safe environment, but they haven't provided concrete reasons why the friend's house is unsafe.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter is close to her friend, and the parent's decision is causing her distress. The parent's actions might be seen as discriminatory if the real issue is discomfort with the friend being a lesbian. The parent claims to support the friend, but the action of not allowing an overnight visit could be perceived as not fully accepting the friend's family, especially since there's no evidence of actual danger.\n\nThe parent's son is kept away when the daughter has friends over, which they justify as providing a safe environment. If that's acceptable, then maybe the parent is being inconsistent by not trusting the friend's family. The key here is whether the parent's decision is based on legitimate safety concerns or personal discomfort with the friend's sexuality.\n\nAlso, the parent's statement about the \"coming out\" party being a \"shit show\" suggests a possible bias. At 12, a child's identity is still forming, and the parent's reaction might indicate a lack of understanding or acceptance of the friend's identity. This could be seen as harmful to the daughter's friendship and the friend's well-being.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, those boundaries should be based on real risks, not prejudice. If the parent's decision is rooted in homophobia or transphobia, even if unintentional, it's problematic. The parent's reasoning lacks specific safety issues, so it might be a case of allowing personal biases to affect their child's social life.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's well-being. Restricting her from a close friend's house without a valid reason could harm their relationship and make the daughter feel rejected. The parent's action might also send a message that the friend's family isn't good enough, which is not supportive.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent's decision might be based on prejudice rather than genuine safety concerns. Therefore, they could be in the wrong for not allowing the daughter to stay over without a valid reason and for potentially supporting harmful stereotypes.\n"
