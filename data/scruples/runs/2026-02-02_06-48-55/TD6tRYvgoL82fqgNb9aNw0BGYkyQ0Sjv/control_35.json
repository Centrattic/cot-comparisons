My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a parent not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay over her lesbian friend's house. The parents had a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate. The parent says they support the family but don't want their daughter to stay there anymore, citing safety. They also mention keeping their son away when the daughter is over their house. \n\nFirst, the parent's reasons. They mention feeling the friend's house isn't a safe environment. But why? They didn't specify any actual safety issues, just the coming out party. Maybe they think the party was too adult for 12-year-olds? But the daughter's friend is also 12, so celebrating sexuality at that age might be seen as premature by some.\n\nThe parent says they support the friend and her family but don't trust them for overnight stays. That's a bit confusing. They might have a problem with the family's openness about sexuality. The parent might be uncomfortable with the \"coming out\" party, thinking it's pushing sexuality on kids. So maybe they're not intolerant but have concerns about appropriateness for the child's age.\n\nBut the parent also says they make sure their son isn't around when the daughter is there, which is about providing a safe environment. This could imply they have their own boundaries. However, the friend's family isn't doing anything illegal or harmful; they're just being open about their sexuality. \n\nThe daughter is close with her friend, and suddenly the parent is restricting that. The parent might not be against the friendship but is reacting to the family's approach. However, the parent's decision is based on their perception of safety, which might not be based on real danger. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the parent is being intolerant or unsupportive by not allowing the sleepover, that would be the case. But if their concern is about the appropriateness of the party and their own comfort with the environment, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the parent's justification for safety is a bit vague. \n\nAnother angle: the parent's actions could be seen as overstepping because the friend's family isn't endangering their daughter. The parent might be projecting their discomfort onto the other family's environment. \n\nSo, is the parent wrong? If they're denying the sleepover based on disapproval of the other family's lifestyle without concrete safety issues, then yes. But if they have genuine concerns about the environment, maybe not. The problem is the parent's reasoning is a bit all over the place. They claim support but then don't trust the family. \n\nThe parent says they don't want to terminate the friendship, just the sleepovers. But the daughter is upset, and others think the parent is intolerant. The parent's own actions (keeping their son away) show they know how to create a safe environment, so maybe they're applying that logic to the friend's house. But without specific safety issues, it's more about personal discomfort. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're denying their daughter the sleepover based on disapproval of the other family's celebration of sexuality, not actual safety concerns. They're being intolerant, even if they think they're being supportive.\n"
