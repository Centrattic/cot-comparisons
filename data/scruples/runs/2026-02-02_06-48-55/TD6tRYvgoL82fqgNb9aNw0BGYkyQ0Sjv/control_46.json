My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter and her best friend are best friends since kindergarten. The friend's family hosted a coming out party for her, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent doesn't want the daughter to stay over there anymore, but they still support the friend. The parent's reasoning is that the friend's environment isn't safe, similar to how they keep their son away when the daughter is over.\n\nSo, the parent is worried about the environment. But why would a lesbian friend's house be unsafe? Homosexuality isn't inherently unsafe. Maybe the parent is uncomfortable with the family's celebration of the daughter's sexuality? The parent mentions they support the friend's happiness but don't want their daughter in that environment. \n\nThe parent's argument is about safety, but they don't specify any actual safety issues. Maybe they're worried about inappropriate content at the party or the parents being too open about their daughter's sexuality. But they didn't mention any specific incidents. It seems like they're making a judgment based on their own discomfort rather than actual danger.\n\nAlso, the parent is drawing a parallel to their own safety measures, like keeping their son away. However, that's a different scenario. Separating siblings for privacy might be standard, but the issue here is about the friend's home. \n\nThe parent is being accused of intolerance, but they claim to support the friend. The problem is that their actions (not allowing the daughter to stay over) might be seen as not supporting the friend's family. The parent's reasoning about safety seems flimsy without evidence. \n\nIn terms of child safety, unless there's a specific reason to believe the friend's home is unsafe (like abuse, neglect, etc.), it's not appropriate to deny a child a friendship. The parent is making a judgment based on the friend's sexuality, which could be discriminatory. \n\nSo, the parent might be in the wrong because they're using a vague safety concern as an excuse to separate the girls without valid reasons. They should be allowing the friendship unless there are concrete safety issues. The parent's own privacy measures at home don't justify denying the daughter her friendship. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
