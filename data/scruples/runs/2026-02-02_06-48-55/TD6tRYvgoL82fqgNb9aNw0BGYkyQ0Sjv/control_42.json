My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The daughter and her friend are best friends, and their parents threw a coming out party. The author thinks it's inappropriate for a 12-year-old to be celebrating sexuality. They don't want the daughter to stay over, but they haven't cut off the friendship. Their reasoning is about safety, similar to how they separate their children when the daughter stays over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The daughter's friend is a lesbian, which the author supports, but the parents had a coming out party. The author feels the environment isn't safe for an overnight stay. The main issue is whether the author's decision is justified.\n\nIn terms of legality and ethical considerations, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's safety. The author isn't opposing the friendship but is concerned about the environment when the daughter is an overnight guest. The comparison to separating their son when the daughter stays over suggests the author is applying similar safety standards.\n\nHowever, the coming out party might be seen as a family event celebrating their daughter's identity, which the author finds inappropriate. The author's support for the friend's happiness is mentioned, so intolerance isn't the issue. The main conflict is about safety versus the daughter's feelings and social life.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If the author's concern is about safety and they're not discriminating based on sexuality but applying general safety measures, they might not be in the wrong. But if the \"safe environment\" is a pretext for discomfort with the friend's sexuality, that's different. The author hasn't provided evidence of any actual safety issues, just a feeling. The daughter might feel rejected if the only issue is the friend's family's celebration of their sexuality.\n\nIn many cases, parents have the right to set boundaries based on their own comfort and safety concerns, even if others disagree. However, if the safety concerns are unfounded and based on prejudice, that's problematic. The author seems to support the friend's identity but is uncomfortable with the public celebration. It's possible the author is conflating their discomfort with the friend's family's choice to have a party with safety concerns. The author's justification about safety is similar to when they separate siblings, which suggests they have standard safety measures. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if their decision is based on genuine safety concerns, even if others perceive it as intolerance. However, if there's no actual safety risk and the decision is based on the friend's sexuality, then it's wrong. The key here is the author's reasoning. Since they mention the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment, but don't provide specific reasons beyond their own discomfort with the party, it's possible their decision is based on personal bias, making them wrong. Alternatively, if they have valid safety reasons, they're justified. The answer hinges on whether the safety concerns are legitimate. Since the scenario doesn't provide evidence of actual danger, the author's position might be seen as discriminatory, even if they claim support.\n"
