My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions they support the friend but feel the environment isn't safe. The daughter is 12, and the friend's family threw a coming out party, which the parent found inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They claim it's about safety, not the friend's sexuality. But the example given is the coming out party, which the parent found \"trashy.\" That might imply some discomfort with the friend's identity, even if they say they support her. The parent also mentions separating their son during sleepovers, which could be about gender dynamics but might also be a way to avoid potential issues. However, the parent hasn't provided specific safety concerns like bad behavior or a history of problems. \n\nThe daughter is close to the friend, and the parent's sudden decision caused conflict. The parent's justification for safety isn't based on concrete evidence but on the party. That could be seen as using safety as a cover for personal bias, even if unintended. Legal and social norms support supporting children's friendships unless there's actual risk. The parent's actions might be perceived as discriminatory, which could harm the daughter's feelings and the friend's family. \n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their child's safety. But without specific risks cited, it's hard to argue that the friend's family isn't a safe environment. The parent's actions might be seen as overprotective or influenced by prejudice, even if they don't intend it. So, likely the parent is in the wrong because they're denying a normal social activity based on their discomfort with the friend's sexuality rather than actual safety concerns.\n"
