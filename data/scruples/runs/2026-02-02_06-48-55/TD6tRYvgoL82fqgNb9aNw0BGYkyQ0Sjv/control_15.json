My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her friend's house, whose parents threw a \"coming out\" party. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They think the party was inappropriate for a 12-year-old, even though they support the friend's sexuality. They mentioned not wanting to \"terminate a friendship\" but are concerned about the environment. The parent also mentions keeping their son away when the daughter is over, to ensure a safe environment.\n\nThe daughter's friend's family is likely a same-sex couple, given the \"coming out\" party. The parent's issue might be with the friend's parents being a same-sex couple, but they claim to support the girl. There's a possible double standard here: if the parent is okay with their son being at the friend's house but not their daughter, maybe that's a problem. Also, the parent's main reason for not allowing the sleepover is the friend's family not guaranteeing a safe environment. But why would the friend's family be unsafe? Maybe because they're a same-sex couple, which the parent might not approve of? But that would be discriminatory.\n\nHowever, the parent could be citing other reasons for safety, like the party being inappropriate. But at 12, children are in middle school, and such support parties might be common among peers. The parent might not be in the wrong if they genuinely feel the environment is unsafe, but if it's based on the friend's parents' sexuality, that could be the issue. Also, the parent is allowing their son to sleep over, which might indicate that the problem is gender-related or perhaps the parent's discomfort with the friend's parents' orientation.\n\nIn terms of legal or social standards, in many places, parents can make decisions about their child's sleeping arrangements based on their comfort, as long as it's not discriminatory. But if the exclusion is based on the friend's parents being LGBTQ+, that could be seen as discriminatory. However, the parent is not forbidding the friendship, just the sleepover. The line between personal comfort and discrimination is thin here.\n\nThe parent's reasoning might be flawed because they can't prove the environment isn't safe just because of the parents' orientation. But if they have other safety concerns, like the party being too adult-themed, that's a different matter. However, the user says they support the girl and her happiness, which suggests the main issue is the parents' sexuality. The parent is also keeping their son away when the daughter is over, which might indicate a double standard\u2014if the son can be there but the daughter can't, maybe the parent is trying to avoid having their son interact with the same-sex parents?\n\nThis seems like a case where the parent's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, could be seen as discriminatory. They're not cutting off the friendship, but they're making a distinction based on the parents' sexual orientation, which is a protected class in many areas. The parent's claim about safety might be a cover for their discomfort with the LGBTQ+ family. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong for allowing their personal biases to affect their child's social life, even if they claim to support the friend.\n"
