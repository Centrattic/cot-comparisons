My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent deciding their 12-year-old daughter can't stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The daughter and her friend are very close since kindergarten, and the friend's parents threw a coming out party for the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention they support the girl's sexuality and don't want to end the friendship, but they feel the friend's house isn't a safe environment for an overnight stay. They also mention that when their daughter stays over, they move their son elsewhere to ensure safety, not because they don't trust him.\n\nSo, the parent's main concern is safety. But why would the friend's house be unsafe? The parent might be worried about inappropriate adult situations given the coming out party. However, the daughter is 12, so maybe the party was just a celebration with family and friends. The parent might be conflating the celebration with something inappropriate for a child, but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent is making a decision based on their perception of safety. They might have valid concerns if they feel the environment isn't suitable for their child. However, there's a risk of making assumptions about the friend's family. The parent might be projecting their discomfort with the friend's sexuality onto the entire household dynamics. \n\nAlso, the parent is not cutting off the friendship entirely, just overnight stays. They're still allowing the daughter to visit during the day. That shows they're trying to balance support and safety. But the daughter is upset, and others think the parent is being intolerant. The parent claims they're not intolerant and support the friend, which could be true, but their actions might not align with that perception.\n\nIn terms of legal or societal standards, there's no law against being uncomfortable with a child's friend's sexuality, but as a parent, creating a safe environment is a priority. However, the parent's reasoning about safety here is unclear. If there's no concrete reason to believe the friend's house is unsafe, the decision might be based on prejudice. \n\nBut the parent is trying to justify their decision by comparing it to their own actions (moving their son when the daughter stays over), implying they take safety seriously. This could indicate that their concerns are genuine. However, if the friend's family is open and supportive, the parent's decision might come off as discriminatory. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's intent might be to ensure safety, but without specific evidence of a dangerous environment, the decision could be seen as discriminatory. The parent's support for the friend's sexuality is clear, but actions can speak louder than words. If the friend's parents are providing a safe and appropriate environment, the parent's refusal might be in the wrong. However, if the parent has valid safety concerns, even if based on personal discomfort, they might not be in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but the lack of concrete evidence for the \"unsafe environment\" tilts towards the parent being in the wrong.\n"
