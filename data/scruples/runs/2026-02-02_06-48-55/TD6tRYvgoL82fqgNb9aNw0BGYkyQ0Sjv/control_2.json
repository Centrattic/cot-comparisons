My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent who doesn't allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her best friend's house because the friend is lesbian. The parent mentions that they support the friend and her happiness, but they feel the friend's house isn't a safe environment for their daughter. The parent also explains that when the daughter stays over, they make sure their own son is elsewhere, not out of distrust but to provide a safe space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They say they support the friend's sexuality but worry about safety. But why would the friend's sexuality make the house unsafe? The parent might be implying that the friend's family is somehow not appropriate for their daughter, maybe due to being a same-sex household. However, same-sex families are perfectly valid and safe. The parent's concern about safety might be based on prejudice rather than actual risk. \n\nAlso, the parent mentioned the \"coming out\" party. They found it inappropriate for a 12-year-old, but the child is openly lesbian. The parent might be uncomfortable with the celebration of sexuality, which could indicate a lack of acceptance even if they claim support. The daughter's friend's family might not be the issue; the parent's own biases might be the problem here. \n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to make decisions about their children's safety. But if the decision is based on the friend's sexual orientation rather than any real danger, that could be discriminatory. The parent says they don't terminate the friendship, just the sleepovers. However, this could still make the daughter feel ostracized, especially if her friend is from a same-sex couple. \n\nThe parent's own action of sending their son away when the daughter stays over might be about gender dynamics, not the friend's family. But if the friend's family is a same-sex couple, maybe the parent is worried about the daughter being exposed to same-sex relationships, which could be a form of bias. \n\nIn terms of legality and social norms, same-sex parents can provide safe environments. The parent's objection isn't based on any legitimate safety concern but rather personal discomfort. Therefore, the parent is likely the asshole here for discriminating against the friend's family based on their sexuality, even if they claim support.\n"
