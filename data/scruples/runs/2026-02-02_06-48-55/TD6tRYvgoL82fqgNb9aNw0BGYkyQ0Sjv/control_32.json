My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent is refusing to let their 12-year-old daughter stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The daughter and her friend have been close since kindergarten. The friend's family threw a surprise \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate, leading them to restrict overnight stays.\n\nFirst, the parent says they support the friend and hope she finds happiness but are concerned about the safety of their daughter. They mention that when the daughter stays over, they move their son out to ensure a safe environment. The parent's reasoning here is a bit confusing. They trust their son but don't trust the friend's house? Wait, the parent is concerned about the friend's family's ability to provide a safe environment, but their own actions involve moving their son out to ensure their home is safe when the daughter stays there. That seems contradictory. Also, the parent's reasoning for not allowing the overnight is based on the \"coming out\" party, which they found trashy. \n\nNow, the key points here are about the child's safety and the parent's reasons for restricting the friendship. If the parent is making a judgment based on the friend's sexuality without concrete evidence of any risk, that could be seen as discriminatory. The parent claims to support the friend, but their actions are limiting the daughter's autonomy. At 12, the child is quite young, but having close friends is part of normal development. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions not trusting the friend's house, but hasn't provided any specific concerns like unsafe conditions or risky behavior. The \"coming out\" party might be a cultural or personal trigger for the parent, but it's not a valid reason to restrict the friendship unless there were actual issues. \n\nThe parent's own actions to ensure safety in their own home (moving their son) are about their own family's setup, not the friend's home. If the parent is worried about the daughter's safety, they should address specific concerns, like possible exposure to inappropriate content at the friend's house, but the parent hasn't mentioned any such issues. It seems like the parent is conflating their discomfort with the friend's family's celebration with a perceived risk, which might be a form of bias. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent is making a decision based on their own feelings about the friend's family's expression of support rather than actual safety concerns. That could be considered discriminatory or not supportive of their daughter's needs and friendships. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not allowing the overnight stay without valid safety reasons, and for projecting their discomfort onto the friend's family's environment.\n"
