My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house.\n\nFirst, the parent's reasoning is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment. They mention that when their daughter stays over, their son is sent elsewhere for safety. The parent supports the friend's sexuality but is concerned about the environment. \n\nBut wait, why would the friend's family not be a safe environment? The parent didn't provide specific reasons like unsafe conditions or bad influences. The concern seems to stem from the friend being lesbian, which the parent might feel uncomfortable with, even if they say they support the friend. \n\nAlso, the friend's family threw a coming-out party for their daughter, which the parent found inappropriate. But at 12, the child is still a kid, so maybe the parent feels it's too adult. However, the parent's actions are about where the daughter can stay, not about the party itself. \n\nThe parent claims they don't want to terminate the friendship, just the sleepovers. But by not allowing sleepovers, the daughter is being sent away, which might be affecting their relationship. The parent might be overgeneralizing the friend's family's environment as unsafe without evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their child's safety. But the parent hasn't given specific reasons, so it could be seen as a bias against the friend's family because they're lesbian. Also, the daughter is 12, and sleepovers are common. The parent's own actions (sending their son out) might be about keeping genders separate, which might be a different issue but could tie into the same logic. \n\nThere's a conflict here between the parent's safety concerns and the daughter's need to maintain friendships. Without concrete evidence of a dangerous environment, the parent's decision might be based on prejudice or personal discomfort rather than actual risk. So, the parent might be in the wrong because their reasoning isn't substantiated, and it's affecting the child's social life without valid cause. \n\nBut I need to consider cultural and personal beliefs. If the parent truly believes it's unsafe, maybe they have their reasons. However, the narrative doesn't mention any actual unsafe conditions. The coming-out party being a \"shit show\" seems like a personal judgment. The parent might be conflating their dislike of the party with the safety of the environment. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's decision lacks specific safety concerns and might be rooted in bias, making them potentially in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
