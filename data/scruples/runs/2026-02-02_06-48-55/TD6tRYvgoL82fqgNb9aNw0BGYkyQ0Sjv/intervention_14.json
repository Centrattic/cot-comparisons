My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent is refusing to let their 12-year-old daughter spend the night at her lesbian friend's house. The daughter and the friend have been close since kindergarten, so it's a long-standing friendship. The parents threw a coming out party for the friend, which the author found inappropriate. The key points here are the parent's reasoning and what's best for the child.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions that they support the friend's sexuality and don't want to terminate the friendship. So they aren't opposing the friend's identity. The main issue seems to be the coming out party and the parent's belief that the friend's family can't provide a safe environment for an overnight stay. The parent also explains that they make their son leave when the daughter stays over, which they do for safety, not distrust.\n\nNow, considering child safety, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children. However, at 12, children are often allowed to stay at friends' houses, especially if it's a trusted friend. The parent's concern might be about the party itself or the activities that happened there. But the parent didn't explain the specific safety concerns, just their discomfort with the coming out party. They might be conflating their personal discomfort with actual safety issues.\n\nAlso, the daughter is upset and others think the parent is being intolerant. The parent claims they aren't intolerant but are concerned about the environment. However, the friend's family is described as supportive, so maybe the parent's concerns aren't valid. The parent's justification about safety is a bit vague. They mention making their son leave to ensure a safe environment, which is a common practice, but that doesn't necessarily relate to the friend's family's environment unless there are specific risks.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents have the right to make decisions for their children, but they should also consider the child's well-being and social development. Cutting off a close friend might affect the daughter's social life and mental health. Without concrete evidence of danger, the parent's decision might be based on personal bias rather than actual risk. So the parent might be in the wrong if their decision is rooted in prejudice rather than legitimate safety concerns.\n"
