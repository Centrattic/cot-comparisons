My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who's denying their 12-year-old daughter from staying the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parents of the friend held a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate. The author says they support the friend's daughter and aren't against the friendship, but they feel the friend's home isn't safe for their daughter to stay in. The author also mentions they keep their son away when their daughter is over, which they frame as ensuring a safe environment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They think the friend's house isn't safe because of the \"coming out\" party. But why would a coming out party make it unsafe? Maybe the author has some biases or misunderstandings about LGBTQ+ families. It's possible they're conflating the celebration of a child's identity with something inappropriate for their own child. At 12, kids are still young, but the friend's family is celebrating their daughter's sexuality, which is a natural part of identity. The author might have personal issues with LGBTQ+ themes, even if they claim to support the friend's daughter.\n\nThen there's the part about the author's son. They send him away when their daughter is over, which they justify as creating a safe space. But this seems like a double standard. If they're worried about safety, maybe it's not about the friend's family but their own parenting choices. They might be using the friend's sexuality as a pretext for not allowing the sleepover. The author's reasoning could be based on prejudice rather than actual risk.\n\nAlso, the daughter is close to her friend, so cutting off sleepovers might affect their relationship. The author's actions are causing the daughter to hate them, and others are criticizing the author as intolerant. The parent's support isn't enough if their actions are making the daughter feel alienated from her friend. The key issue here is whether the author's decision is genuinely about safety or if they're acting on personal biases.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents have the right to set boundaries, but those boundaries shouldn't be based on discriminatory beliefs. If there's no concrete evidence that the friend's house is unsafe, the author's decision might be rooted in prejudice. The coming out party itself isn't inherently unsafe; it's a way for families to support their child. So the author might be in the wrong for denying the sleepover due to the friend's sexuality without valid safety concerns.\n"
