My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter and her friend are close since kindergarten. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for the daughter, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent doesn't want the daughter to stay over there now, but says they support the friend. The parent also mentions they keep their son away when the daughter is over, for safety.\n\nNow, the parent's reasoning is that the friend's house isn't a safe environment. But the friend's family is celebrating their daughter's sexuality, which the parent finds \"trashy\" and not suitable for a 12-year-old. However, the parent says they support the friend's happiness. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the parent is objecting to the celebration of the friend's sexuality, implying that it's not appropriate for the daughter to be in that environment. But the parent is allowing the friendship to continue, just not the overnight stays. The parent's own safety measure (keeping their son away) suggests they prioritize safety, but they're applying that to the friend's house because of the party.\n\nIs the parent being intolerant? The parent claims they support the friend, but their actions suggest discomfort with the celebration of the friend's sexual orientation. At 12, the child is young, and the parent might be worried about the friend's identity influencing their daughter. However, the parent is not cutting off the friendship entirely, just overnight stays. \n\nBut the parent's reasoning might be based on a misunderstanding. Supporting someone's identity doesn't inherently make an environment unsafe. The parent is equating the celebration of being lesbian with an unsafe environment, which could be a form of bias. The parent's son is also kept away when the daughter is over, which implies that their safety concerns aren't about the daughter's friend's environment, but perhaps about other factors. \n\nThe parent's actions might be perceived as discriminatory because they're making a decision based on the friend's family's support of her daughter's sexuality. Even if the parent supports the friend, they might not want their daughter exposed to certain discussions or environments, which could be a privacy or comfort issue. However, the parent's stated reason for not allowing the stay is safety, but there's no evidence provided that the friend's house is unsafe. The parent's own behavior (keeping their son away) suggests they prioritize safety, but they're applying that to the friend's house without clear justification beyond the party.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, if those boundaries are based on prejudice rather than actual risk, that could be seen as wrong. The parent is not cutting off the friendship, which is positive, but limiting overnight stays based on the friend's identity or family's support might be discriminatory. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's decision could be viewed as wrong because it's based on the friend's sexual orientation rather than a legitimate safety concern. The parent's actions might be fueled by personal discomfort rather than actual threat, which could be seen as intolerance. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's another angle. \n\nWait, the parent mentions they don't want the daughter to stay over because the friend's family can't guarantee safety. But the parent doesn't provide evidence of unsafe practices beyond the party. If the parent is genuinely concerned about privacy or other factors (like the friend's parents being present during the stay), that's different. But the parent's reasoning seems tied to the celebration of the friend's sexuality, which is not a valid safety concern. \n\nSo, the parent is likely in the wrong because their decision is based on prejudice against the friend's sexual orientation rather than an actual safety issue. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
