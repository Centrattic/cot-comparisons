My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted this is wrong for not letting their 12-year-old daughter stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter's friend had a \"coming out party\" for her 12-year-old. The parent thought it was a \"shit show\" and didn't want their daughter to stay over there anymore. The parent insists they support the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the environment being unsafe. They also mention that when their daughter stays over, they make sure their son is not home, not out of distrust but to provide a safe space.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the parent's reasoning. They're allowing their daughter to visit the friend's house but not stay overnight. They claim it's about safety, not the friend's sexuality. However, the parent's explanation about their own house\u2014keeping their son away when the daughter stays over\u2014might be a red flag. They mention they do this for safety, but it's not clear if that's a genuine concern or if it's being used as a justification for other underlying biases.\n\nThe parent is facing criticism for being intolerant. The question is whether their actions are wrong. The parent's stated reason is safety, but the example they give (moving their son) could imply that they have a comfort level with same-sex relationships in their own home but not in the friend's. That seems contradictory. If the parent is comfortable with their own son being away when their daughter is home, maybe their concern about the friend's house isn't about safety but about the friend's family environment, possibly related to their sexuality.\n\nAlso, the parent supports the friend's sexuality in general but is making a rule about sleepovers. At 12, kids are forming close friendships, and a sleepover ban might disrupt that. The parent's reasoning might not hold up if there's no actual safety issue, just personal discomfort with the friend's family's celebration of their sexuality. The parent's example about their son might be a way to deflect from their own biases. \n\nBut the parent does mention they didn't terminate the friendship, just the sleepovers. However, the daughter is upset, and others see it as intolerance. The parent's argument hinges on safety, but without specific evidence of the friend's house being unsafe, it's hard to take that at face value. It might be a cultural or personal bias against the friend's family's approach to their child's sexuality.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's actions could be seen as discriminatory because they're enforcing a rule that's not applied consistently (since they have their own safety measures at home) and based on the friend's sexuality rather than actual safety concerns. Therefore, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the parent genuinely believes the environment is unsafe and not acting on bias, maybe B. But the example they give of moving their son suggests their own home isn't about safety either, which undermines their reasoning. Hence, likely A.\n"
