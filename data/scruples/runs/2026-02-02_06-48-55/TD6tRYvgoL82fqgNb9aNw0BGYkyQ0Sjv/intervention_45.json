My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent explains that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which they found inappropriate for a child's sexuality. The parent claims they support the friend but feel the environment isn't safe for their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that the party felt \"trashy\" and that they don't want their daughter to stay over. However, they also say they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship. The key issue here is the parent's judgment about a 12-year-old's sexuality and the appropriateness of a coming out party. \n\nAt 12, many children are exploring their identities, and while coming out parties can be significant, the parent's reaction might be influenced by their own discomfort rather than actual safety concerns. The parent's statement about ensuring a safe environment by moving their son elsewhere isn't directly related to the friend's sexuality but perhaps to their own biases. \n\nThe parent's decision could be seen as discriminatory, even if they claim support. The child's right to form friendships and the parent's role in respecting that, unless there's a legitimate safety issue, is important. The parent hasn't provided evidence of an unsafe environment beyond their own discomfort with the party. \n\nIn many societies, LGBTQ+ support includes respecting individuals' identities and allowing them to socialize safely. The parent's actions might be perceived as unsupportive, even if their intention is to protect. The daughter's distress and the community's view of the parent as intolerant suggest a conflict in the parent's approach. \n\nTherefore, the parent may be in the wrong because their decision is based on personal discomfort rather than objective safety concerns, which could undermine their daughter's friendship and the friend's identity.\n"
