My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The parent cites the friend's family hosting a \"coming out\" party as a reason, even though they say they support the friend. The parent also mentions they separate their son when the daughter stays over.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the parent's reasoning and the potential issues with that reasoning. The parent says they're concerned about the \"safe environment,\" but their reasoning might be problematic. Hosting a coming out party for a 12-year-old seems unusual, but the parent's issue might be more about discomfort with the friend's sexuality rather than actual safety concerns. The parent claims they support the friend but the action of keeping the daughter away from the friend's house could be seen as contradictory. Also, the parent mentions they take steps to ensure their daughter's safety by separating their son, which implies they have control over their own home safety, but they're making a decision based on perceived risks from the friend's household without specific evidence of danger.\n\nThe parent's decision might be influenced by personal biases or misunderstandings about the friend's family. The question is whether their reasoning is valid. The \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) format often reveals the person's own biases. The parent might be conflating the friend's sexuality with an unsafe environment, which is a form of prejudice. Even if they believe they're supporting the friend, the action of keeping their daughter away could be seen as not fully supporting the friend's family. The daughter is close to this friend, so the parent's decision could harm the child's emotional well-being by restricting a meaningful relationship without a concrete reason related to safety.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might genuinely believe that the friend's household isn't safe. However, they don't provide specific incidents or reasons beyond the coming out party. The coming out party itself, while perhaps a cultural norm in some communities, doesn't inherently make a home unsafe. The parent's own actions (separating their son) suggest they prioritize their daughter's safety in their home, but they're making assumptions about the friend's home without evidence. This could be seen as overstepping and being intolerant, even if not intentionally.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent's reasoning seems based on prejudice rather than actual safety concerns, making them in the wrong. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
