My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for a judgment based on the given scenario.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a parent who decided not to let their 12-year-old daughter stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The reason given is that the friend's family, after a \"coming out\" party, might not provide a safe environment. The author mentions they support the friend and her sexuality but feel the need to keep their son away when the daughter stays over. \n\nNow, considering the daughter's age, 12 is young. Parents often make decisions based on safety, whether it's about sleepovers, friends, or other activities. The key points here are the author's rationale for their decision. They mention safety concerns, which can be subjective. \n\nThe \"coming out\" party was described as a \"shit show\" by the author. This might indicate discomfort with the celebration's nature, but the author clarifies they support the friend. However, the decision is framed around safety. The author also mentions ensuring their son is elsewhere when the daughter is over, which might be about privacy or avoiding sibling interactions, but perhaps the author is concerned about same-sex interactions? Wait, the friend is a girl, so the daughter is spending time with her friend. The author's son is being kept away, maybe to prevent him from being around during sleepovers, but the underlying concern might be about same-sex interactions? Or perhaps the author is conflating the friend's sexuality with an unsafe environment. \n\nThe community's reaction is that the author is seen as intolerant. But the author claims they are supportive. The main issue is whether the decision is justified. The author's reasoning is about safety, but is that a valid concern here? The parents of the friend might have a safe environment, and the author's judgment based on the party might be an overreaction. \n\nAlso, the daughter is close friends, and the author's decision might be impacting the child's social life. At 12, friendships are crucial. The author's decision could be seen as unnecessary if the friend's house is safe. However, parents do have the right to set boundaries based on their comfort level, even if others disagree. \n\nBut is the author's reasoning based on legitimate safety concerns or on personal discomfort with the friend's sexuality? The line here is whether the safety concerns are real or a way to justify intolerance. If the author is using safety as a pretext for not accepting the friend's sexuality, then they'd be in the wrong. However, if they genuinely believe the environment isn't safe (even if others don't), they might not be in the wrong, though their reasoning could be flawed. \n\nThe part about the son being elsewhere when the daughter is over might be a red flag. If the author is uncomfortable with their daughter staying with a girl because of the friend's sexuality, that could imply bias. If the same rule applied regardless of the friend's gender or sexuality, it might be different. But here, the specific context of the friend being lesbian and the author's reaction to the coming out party suggests possible underlying intolerance. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the safety concern is genuine or a cover for prejudice. If it's the latter, the author is in the wrong. If it's the former, maybe not. However, given that the author says they support the friend's happiness and only want a safe environment, but makes a decision that others see as discriminatory, it's possible they are in the wrong. The community's reaction also plays a role; if most people view the decision as unjust, that might indicate the author is incorrect. \n\nIn many cases, such decisions can be seen as overprotective or influenced by prejudice. Since the author's reasoning might not be based on actual safety but rather on discomfort with the friend's sexuality, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). However, if the author's safety concerns are legitimate (even if unfounded), then B. But given the context, it's more likely that the author is using the safety excuse to avoid supporting their daughter's friendship, which is influenced by the friend's sexuality. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n"
