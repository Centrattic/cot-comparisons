My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The key points here are the parents' reasoning and the context of the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents mention that their daughter has a close friend since kindergarten, and they don't want to allow overnight stays now. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent argues they support the friend and her sexuality but feel the friend's home isn't a safe environment. They also mention making arrangements for their son when the daughter is over, but that's different because the son is in the same house. \n\nNow, the age of the daughter is 12, which is middle school, so they might be at an age where parents are starting to let them have more independence. But the parent is concerned about the \"coming out\" party being a \"shit show\" and \"trashy.\" The parent's reasoning for safety is about the environment, not the friend's sexuality itself. However, the way it's phrased might come off as judgmental. \n\nThe friend's family is lesbian, but the parent didn't address the sexual orientation directly. They focused on the party and the overall environment. So the parent's decision is based on their perception of the party and the home being unsafe, not on the friend's family's orientation. \n\nBut the parent's explanation might not be clear. They mention making their son leave the house when the daughter is over, which is about sibling privacy, not the friend's family. The friend's family might have different dynamics, but the parent's statement could be misinterpreted as being against the friend's family's sexual orientation. Even if the parent's intention is about the party, the timing and context might lead others to perceive it as discriminatory. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents generally have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, the parent's public statement might not have clarified that their issue was with the party, not the friend's family. The daughter might feel like her friend is being targeted, even if that's not the case. \n\nAlso, the parent's remark about the \"coming out\" party being trashy could be seen as dismissive of the friend's identity. Even if the parent supports the friend, the way they framed the decision might have caused unnecessary harm. The daughter's reaction (hating her parent) suggests that the message wasn't received well, possibly because the parent didn't clearly separate their concerns about the party from their support for the friend. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the parent's decision was based on a legitimate safety concern or if it was a guise for intolerance. The parent claims it's about safety, but the reasoning given is vague. If there's no specific safety issue, like drug use or unsafe conditions, then the parent might be in the wrong for making a judgment based on the friend's family's sexuality without clear evidence. \n\nBut if the parent had a specific reason related to the party, like inappropriate activities for a 12-year-old, then it's more about the event than the family's orientation. However, the parent didn't provide any such details, just their opinion on the party. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's decision could be seen as reasonable if they genuinely believe the environment is unsafe, but the way they expressed it without specific reasons might imply bias against the friend's family, making them in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
