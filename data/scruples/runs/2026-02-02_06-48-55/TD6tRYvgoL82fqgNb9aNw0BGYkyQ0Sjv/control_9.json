My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The scenario involves a parent's decision based on their discomfort with a \"coming out party\" and concerns about safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that they support the friend's sexuality but feel the environment isn't safe for an overnight stay. They also mention separating their son during sleepovers, which they justify as creating a safe environment. The key here is whether the parent's actions are based on legitimate safety concerns or prejudice.\n\nThe parent's argument hinges on the idea that the friend's home isn't safe, possibly implying that the family's openness or the party's nature (a coming out party) makes it inappropriate. However, there's no evidence provided that the friend's home is actually unsafe. Safety concerns usually require specific reasons, like known dangers or past incidents. The parent's discomfort with the party might stem from personal beliefs rather than actual risk.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that they're not ending the friendship but just the sleepovers. This could be seen as a way to protect their daughter without cutting off the relationship entirely. However, the line between safety and prejudice can be thin. If the parent is using safety as a justification for underlying biases, that's problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. If the parent genuinely believes that an overnight stay at the friend's house could expose their daughter to situations that aren't age-appropriate or safe, they might feel justified. But in this case, the coming out party was for the friend's daughter, not the daughter's friend. The parent's daughter is just a guest, so the party's content might not directly affect her safety unless there's explicit content or inappropriate behavior involved.\n\nThe parent's comparison to keeping their son away during sleepovers at their house shows they apply similar logic there. However, that's about managing sibling dynamics, which is different from the friend's family's sexual orientation. If the parent is applying the same standard regardless of the family's orientation, then it's not discriminatory. But if the decision is specifically about the friend's family being lesbian, that's a different story.\n\nThe community's reaction is also a factor. The parent says everyone thinks they're intolerant, which might indicate a societal expectation to be more accepting. The parent claims support but their actions contradict that, leading to perceived hypocrisy.\n\nIn terms of child psychology, sleepovers are common among friends, and suddenly cutting them off can strain the friendship. The daughter feeling hated suggests a significant emotional impact. The parent needs to balance safety with the child's emotional well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent's decision may be based more on personal discomfort with the friend's family's sexuality rather than legitimate safety concerns. There's a risk of the parent being in the wrong by enforcing a rule that's not grounded in actual danger but instead in prejudice, even if they frame it as safety. However, if the parent can demonstrate that there are specific safety issues unrelated to the family's orientation, that's different. But given the information, there's no evidence of that. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for using a safety excuse to avoid supporting their daughter's friendship.\n"
