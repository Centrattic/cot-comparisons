My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The parent is saying they don't want their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The friend had a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent claims to support the friend but doesn't want the daughter to stay overnight, citing safety concerns. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is intolerant.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The daughter's friend is a lesbian, and the parent is okay with the friendship but not the overnight stays. The parent's reasoning is about safety, mentioning that when the daughter stays over at their house, they send their son away. The parent says they don't disapprove of the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the friend's home environment being unsafe. \n\nNow, is the parent wrong? Let's break it down. The parent is allowing the daughter to be friends with a lesbian, which is supportive. However, the parent is refusing the overnight stay specifically because of the friend's family environment. The parent is concerned about safety, which is a common parental concern. But is the parent's reasoning valid? The problem is that the parent is linking the friend's sexuality to the safety of the home environment. Even if they claim to support the friend, by saying the home isn't safe because of the \"coming out\" party, they might be implying that the friend's family is somehow a bad environment because of their sexuality. \n\nAlso, the parent is projecting their own actions (sending their son away when the daughter stays) as a safety measure. But that's their own home, not the friend's. The parent's concern about the friend's home's safety is not explained in detail. Are there actual safety issues, or is the parent uncomfortable with the friend's family because they are LGBTQ+? The \"coming out\" party might have made the parent uneasy, leading them to assume the home isn't a safe space for their daughter. This could be a case of unconscious bias or prejudice, where the parent is using safety as a justification for their discomfort with the friend's sexuality. \n\nThe daughter's reaction is to hate her parent, and others see the parent as intolerant. The parent insists they are supportive, but their actions might contradict that. By not allowing the daughter to stay over because of the friend's family's sexuality, even without concrete safety issues, the parent is making a judgment based on the family's identity. The parent's reasoning about safety is vague and not supported by specific examples, which makes it seem like a cover for their discomfort with the friend's family being LGBTQ+. \n\nIn many cases, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children, but when those boundaries are based on prejudice, it can be problematic. The parent here is allowing the friendship but limiting the interaction based on the friend's family's sexuality, which could be seen as discriminatory. The parent's actions might be harming the daughter's relationship and the friend's family's feelings, even if the parent's intent is to protect. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parent is likely in the wrong because their decision is based on discomfort with the friend's sexuality and the associated event, rather than actual safety concerns. They should be able to support the friendship fully, including overnight stays, unless there's a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason to restrict it.\n"
