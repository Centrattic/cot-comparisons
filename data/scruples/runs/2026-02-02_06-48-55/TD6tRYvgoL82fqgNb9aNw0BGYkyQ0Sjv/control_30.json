My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who wrote the Ask the Anon (AITA) post is in the wrong for not letting their 12-year-old daughter stay at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the daughter and her best friend are very close since kindergarten. The friend's family had a \"coming out\" party for her, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. The parent then decided their daughter can't stay over anymore, leading to conflict.\n\nThe parent claims they support the friend's sexuality but don't want the environment to be unsafe. They also mention they make their son leave when the daughter is over, not out of distrust but for safety. \n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The parent is denying the daughter a sleepover due to the friend's family being openly lesbian. The parent's justification is about safety, but the child is only 12. The parent's reasoning seems to conflate the friend's family's lifestyle with an unsafe environment, which might be a form of homophobia or misunderstanding. They also mention supporting the friend's happiness but not the family's environment, which is contradictory. \n\nHowever, the parent isn't ending the friendship, just the sleepovers. They might have valid concerns about supervision, but the way they framed it (calling the party a \"shit show\") suggests discomfort with the celebration of the friend's sexuality. The parent's actions could be seen as discriminatory if their safety concerns are unfounded. \n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set boundaries based on their own comfort with supervision, especially for younger children. But in this case, the parent's reasoning is tied to the friend's family's identity rather than specific safety issues like past incidents. That could make their stance seem biased. \n\nSo, the parent's decision is based on their own discomfort with the family's open celebration of their daughter's sexuality, which is a form of prejudice. They are not providing a valid safety reason beyond the family's identity, which is problematic. Therefore, the parent is likely in the wrong because their decision is rooted in intolerance rather than actual safety concerns.\n"
