My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay at her friend's house because the friend is a lesbian. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 12 and her friend is also 12. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate. The author is concerned about the safety of their daughter when staying overnight at the friend's house. They mention that when the daughter stays over, the author makes sure their son is elsewhere. The author says they don't oppose the friendship, just the overnight stays because they don't feel the friend's home is safe.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's reasons for the decision. They claim it's about safety, not the friend's sexuality. However, the perception is that the author is being intolerant because of the friend's sexual orientation. The friends are close, and the author's daughter is upset. Others think the author is being an asshole.\n\nBut wait, the author says they support the friend and want her to be happy. The main issue is the overnight stay. The author's concern is about safety, not the friend's identity. However, in reality, the safety concern might be a cover for discomfort with the friend's sexuality. The author's son is not an issue, so maybe the problem is the friend's family's environment. But the author hasn't provided specific reasons why the friend's house is unsafe beyond the party. \n\nIn some cases, parents might have legitimate concerns about other parents' capabilities, but here the concern seems linked to the friend's sexual orientation. The author's reasoning might be discriminatory if there's no actual evidence of an unsafe environment. The \"coming out\" party at 12 might be seen as premature by some, but the author's issue is with the friend's sexuality, not the party itself. \n\nSo, if the author is making a decision based on the friend's sexual orientation without any real safety issues, that's a problem. Even if the author frames it as safety, the underlying reason could be intolerance. The daughter's reaction and others' perceptions support that. However, if there are valid safety concerns unrelated to the friend's identity, then it's different. But the author hasn't mentioned any specific unsafe practices, just general discomfort with the party. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because the decision seems based on the friend's sexual orientation rather than actual safety. But if the author's concern is genuinely about the environment, maybe not. However, the way it's presented, it seems like the author is conflating the \"coming out\" party with safety. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
