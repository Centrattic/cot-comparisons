My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants to know if they're being an \"asshole\" for not letting their daughter stay over her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 12, so they're both pre-teens. The friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate. The author mentions supporting the friend and not wanting to end the friendship, but they're concerned about safety when the daughter stays over.\n\nWait, the author's reasoning is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment. But why? The friend is a 12-year-old girl, and her parents are lesbian. The author's own approach is to separate their son when the daughter has friends over. They mention making their son leave to ensure a safe environment. That seems like a privacy measure, maybe to prevent siblings from being present during sleepovers. \n\nBut here, the issue is the friend's family. The author is worried about safety there. But the friend's family is the daughter's best friend's family, so they've been close for years. The author's daughter is often over there. The only change is the coming out party, which the author found distasteful. The author might be conflating their discomfort with the celebration of sexuality (which they think is too early) with a perceived safety issue, even though there's no evidence of actual danger. \n\nThe author claims to support the friend, so maybe they're using a safety excuse to avoid dealing with their discomfort. The problem is that the author isn't providing a concrete reason why the friend's home is unsafe. It seems like a personal bias or misunderstanding. Also, the author's own method of ensuring safety (making their son leave) doesn't relate to the friend's family's sexual orientation. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety, but those boundaries shouldn't be based on discrimination. If there's no actual threat, then the author's decision might be seen as discriminatory, even if they don't mean for it to be. The daughter's friends and others think the author is being intolerant, which suggests that others see this as a bias issue. \n\nHowever, if the author genuinely believes the environment isn't safe, they might have a right to be cautious. But without evidence, it's hard to validate that belief. The author's reasoning seems to be more about personal discomfort with the coming out party rather than an actual safety concern. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's decision is based on their personal feelings about the friend's family's sexuality and a specific event they found inappropriate, not on any real safety issues. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not allowing the sleepover based on discriminatory reasons, even if they claim to support the friend. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
