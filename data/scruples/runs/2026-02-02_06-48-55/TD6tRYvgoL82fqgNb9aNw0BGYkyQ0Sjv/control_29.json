My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which they found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. They also mention wanting to ensure a safe environment, similar to how they arrange for their son to be elsewhere when the daughter stays over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social norms. In many places, celebrating a child's sexuality isn't illegal, and parents have the right to set boundaries based on their comfort. However, the parent is allowing their daughter to be friends with the girl but not stay over, which might be seen as a double standard. The parent claims to support the friend's sexuality but is concerned about the environment.\n\nThe parent's reasoning about safety is a key point. They mention making their son leave when the daughter stays, so the logic might be about privacy or other safety measures. However, the friend's house might not have the same setup. The parent might be projecting their own family's arrangement onto the friend's household without knowing the specifics.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the daughter's feelings. The daughter is upset and others think the parent is being intolerant. The parent says they support the friend, but their actions might contradict that, making it seem like a judgment of the friend's family based on their sexuality. This could inadvertently make the daughter feel like her friend's identity is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, parents do have the right to set rules for their children's safety and comfort. If the parent genuinely feels the friend's home isn't a safe environment, even if others disagree, that's their prerogative. However, the parent's reasoning around the \"coming out\" party being a \"shit show\" suggests discomfort with the celebration of the friend's sexuality, which could be seen as discriminatory, even if unintended.\n\nSo, the conflict is between parental rights to set boundaries and potential discrimination based on the friend's family's orientation. If the parent's main issue is the celebration, which is a family event, that might be a sensitive area. It's possible the parent is conflating the celebration with the daughter's safety, leading to a judgment that's not solely based on the friend's environment but on the family's identity.\n\nIn conclusion, while parents have the right to make decisions for their children, the parent's reasoning here could be seen as discriminatory or based on prejudice against the friend's family's sexuality, even if they claim support. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
