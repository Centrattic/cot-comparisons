My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her friend's house, which is a lesbian family.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions that the friend's parents threw a \"coming out\" party. The parent found this inappropriate, thinking it's too soon to celebrate a child's sexuality at age 12. They then decided to stop overnight visits, leading to the daughter being upset and others criticizing the parent as intolerant.\n\nThe parent clarifies they support the friend's sexuality and aren't ending the friendship. Their reasoning is about safety\u2014specifically, the son being elsewhere when the daughter stays over. They mention they do something similar with their own son, ensuring privacy for the daughter. So their concern is about creating a safe environment.\n\nNow, considering if the parent is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend is a lesbian, which is a sexual orientation, not a safety issue per se. The parent's objection seems to stem from the \"coming out\" party, which they found excessive. But the parent isn't the one who came out; the friend's family did. The parent is making a decision based on their perception of the friend's home environment, possibly conflating the celebration with something inappropriate for their daughter.\n\nHowever, the parent's main stated reason is about safety, ensuring their daughter isn't in a potentially unsafe situation. They mention their own practices with their son, which are similar. The parent isn't opposing the friendship but the overnight stays. The key here is whether the parent is being discriminatory. The parent claims support, but their actions are based on the friend's family's choice to have a coming out party, which could be seen as judgmental. \n\nIn many contexts, supporting a child's friend regardless of their family's orientation is expected. The parent's reasoning about safety might be a cover for discomfort with the friend's family's actions. Also, the daughter is 12, and parents often have guidelines about sleepovers based on various factors. But the parent's explanation might be misaligned with actual safety concerns. The parent could be seen as not supporting their daughter's friendship, which might affect the child's trust and emotional well-being. \n\nSo, while the parent claims to support the friend, their decision is based on a perceived issue with the friend's family's approach to their daughter's sexuality, which isn't inherently unsafe. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong for not allowing the sleepover based on that reasoning, even if they have other safety measures in place. The parent's stance might be seen as discriminatory, as they're making a judgment about the friend's family based on their celebration, which is a personal choice. The parent's actions could be harming the daughter's feelings and the friendship, which might be more important at that age.\n"
