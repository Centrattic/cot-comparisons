My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who refused their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house is in the wrong. The parent claims it's because the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment, even though they support the friend. They also mention that when the friend stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They say they support the friend and the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the environment. However, the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent is drawing a distinction between supporting the friend and allowing an overnight stay, possibly due to their own discomfort with the celebration of sexuality at a young age.\n\nBut wait, the parent's son is sent away when the friend stays over, so they're ensuring their son isn't there. That might imply they have some reservations about the friend's presence, especially with their own child. But the parent claims it's for safety. However, the friend's family isn't known to have any unsafe elements beyond their support of their daughter's sexuality. The parent's reasoning seems to hinge on the idea that the friend's home isn't safe because of the \"coming out\" party, which they found trashy. But the party was a supportive event for their daughter's identity, which the parent might not agree with.\n\nAge is a factor here. At 12, the girls are in middle school, and many parents have different comfort levels regarding their children's social lives. The parent's decision could be seen as discriminatory if it's based on the friend's sexuality. Even if the parent supports the friend, the action of not allowing an overnight stay might be perceived as intolerance or a lack of trust in the friend's family. The parent also mentions not terminating the friendship, but the restriction on sleepovers could still damage the daughter's feelings and the friendship.\n\nAnother angle: the parent's stated concern about safety is vague. If there were specific safety issues, that's one thing, but the complaint is about the \"coming out\" party. That suggests the parent might be uncomfortable with the celebration of a child's sexuality, which could be seen as a personal bias rather than an actual safety risk. This could lead to the parent being viewed as in the wrong, as it's about their own discomfort rather than a genuine threat.\n\nHowever, parents have the right to set boundaries they feel are appropriate for their children. If the parent genuinely believes that the environment isn't safe, even if others don't, they might not be in the wrong. But the key here is whether the decision is based on valid safety concerns or personal prejudice. Since the parent supports the friend's identity but is making a rule based on their own discomfort with the family's supportive actions, it's more likely a case of personal bias.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the parent is in the wrong (A) because their decision is based on their own discomfort with the friend's family's expression of support for their daughter's sexuality, not actual safety concerns. This could be seen as discriminatory and unsupportive, even if the parent claims otherwise.\n"
