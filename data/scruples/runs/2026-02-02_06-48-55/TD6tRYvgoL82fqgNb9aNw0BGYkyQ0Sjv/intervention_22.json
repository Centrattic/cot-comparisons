My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The key points here are the parents' reasons and the context of the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter and her friend have been close since kindergarten. The friend's parents hosted a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate. The author says they don't want the daughter to stay over there because they feel the environment isn't safe, but they mention they separate their own son when their daughter stays over. The author claims they support the friend's sexuality but don't trust the friend's parents.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is the parents' reasoning. They don't specify any concrete reasons why the friend's house is unsafe. They just mention the coming out party as a reason, which they found trashy. But the friend's parents hosted it to support their daughter. The author's concern about safety seems vague\u2014maybe they're conflating their discomfort with the friend's family's lifestyle as a safety issue. However, the author also mentions that when their daughter stays over, they send their son away, which implies they think about safety in their own home. So maybe they're applying different standards here.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, and kids that age often have friends of the opposite sex staying over. The author's decision could be seen as targeting the friend's family because of their sexuality. The parents might be projecting their discomfort onto the friend's home environment, leading them to make a judgment without valid safety concerns. \n\nBut the author says they don't want to end the friendship, just the sleepovers. They claim to support the friend. So is it wrong to make a decision based on perceived safety even if it's not based on facts? Legally, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children. However, if the friend's parents are providing a safe environment, the author's refusal might be based on prejudice rather than genuine safety. The coming out party isn't a safety issue per se, unless there were specific concerns like drugs, alcohol, or inappropriate behavior, which the author doesn't mention. \n\nThe daughter's feelings are hurt, and others might see the author as intolerant. The author's reasoning seems to mix personal discomfort with the friend's family's celebration of their daughter's sexuality as a reason to restrict a normal social activity. So, while the author has the right to make decisions for their child, the basis for this decision could be problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing the sleepovers based on unfounded safety concerns related to the friend's sexuality.\n"
