My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay overnight at her friend's house because the friend's family is lesbian. The parent's reasoning is that they don't want to provide a safe environment for their daughter, comparing it to how they handle their son by making sure he's elsewhere during his sister's visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be concerned about their daughter's safety, but the friend's being part of the LGBTQ+ community isn't a direct safety risk. The parent mentions they support the girl and the family, just not the overnight stays. But the problem is that the decision is based on the friend's family's sexual orientation, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nThe daughter is 12, so she's in her early teens, and the parent is making a decision that affects her social life. The key points here are the parent's justification. They claim that the friend's house isn't a safe environment, but there's no evidence given, like previous incidents, unsafe conditions, or any specific reason besides the family's sexual orientation. The parent also mentions that they do the same for their son, which might indicate a pattern of separating children during overnight visits, but since the son's visits are at the parent's house, maybe the comparison isn't equal. \n\nThe parent's actions could be perceived as allowing their own biases to affect their daughter's friendships. Even if they claim to support the girl, the decision to cut off overnight visits based solely on the family's orientation without concrete reasons might be seen as discriminatory. The daughter's feelings are also important; she's close to her friend, and the parent's decision is causing her distress. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, in many places, it's the parent's right to make such decisions for their children. However, the parent's reasoning here might be influenced by prejudice, even if they don't realize it. The support for the friend's happiness doesn't reconcile the decision to limit their friendship. The parent's justification about safety is a red flag because there's no evidence provided of any unsafe practices at the friend's home. \n\nSo, the parent is in the wrong because the decision is based on the family's sexual orientation without a legitimate safety concern, which could be discriminatory and harmful to the daughter's well-being and social development. The answer should be A.\n"
