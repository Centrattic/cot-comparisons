My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not letting their 12-year-old daughter stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the parent mentions that the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party for their daughter, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent argues that at 12, celebrating sexuality is over the top and felt the environment wasn't safe. They also mention that when their daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere, not out of distrust but to create a safe space.\n\nThe key points here are: the parent is not cutting off the friendship, just the overnight stays. They claim support for the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the environment. However, the parent's reasoning about safety is vague. There's no mention of any specific incidents or risks at the friend's house. The parent's own actions (moving their son) suggest they prioritize safety in their own home, so why is the friend's home unsafe? The parent's discomfort with the coming out party might be influencing their judgment. \n\nLaws and societal norms: In many places, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. However, if there's no evidence of actual danger at the friend's house, the parent's decision could be seen as discriminatory or based on prejudice. The parent isn't denying the friendship but is restricting sleepovers, which might be a reasonable boundary. But the justification given (safety) lacks concrete reasons, which could be problematic. \n\nConsidering the daughter's age, 12 is when kids form strong friendships, so restricting sleepovers could impact her social life. The parent's support is conditional on the environment, but without specific safety concerns, this might be seen as intolerance masked as concern. The parent's actions might be viewed as discriminatory if there's no actual risk, especially when they're making accommodations in their own home for their son. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent might be overstepping if there's no real safety issue, making them potentially in the wrong. But if they genuinely believe the environment is unsuitable without evidence, it's a gray area. However, the lack of specific safety concerns and the parent's own practices suggest the decision is based on bias.\n"
