My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The daughter's friend had a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate for a 12-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parent supports the friend's sexuality in general but is uncomfortable with the \"coming out\" party. The parent also mentions they ensure their son is not at home when the daughter stays, implying they're concerned about providing a safe environment. The daughter and friend are close, and the parent is now facing backlash for their decision.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Let's break down possible angles. From a supportiveness standpoint, the parent claims to support the friend, but their action of cutting off sleepovers might be seen as not supporting their daughter's friendship. Also, the parent's concern about the \"coming out\" party could be viewed as judgmental, even if they don't hold the same views as the friend's parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's decision is framed around providing a safe environment. They mention they take steps to ensure safety when their daughter is at home. However, the parent's reasoning about the friend's house being unsafe isn't explained in detail\u2014maybe they feel the friend's family is more liberal or open about sexuality, which the parent is uncomfortable with. But is that a valid reason to prevent sleepovers? \n\nIn many cases, parents have different comfort levels regarding their children's social environments. The parent isn't cutting off the friendship entirely, just sleepovers. The friend's family isn't shown to have done anything harmful or unsafe. The parent's reasoning might be based on personal discomfort rather than actual risk, which could be considered discriminatory or intolerant by others. \n\nAlso, considering the age of the children, 12 years old, it's possible that the parent is overreacting to the \"coming out\" party, which is a celebration of identity that the friend's family and possibly the daughter are proud of. The parent's reaction could be seen as invalidating the friend's experience, even if they claim support. \n\nHowever, parents do have the right to set boundaries based on their values. The line is crossed if the decision is based on prejudice. The parent says they support the friend's happiness but are concerned about the environment. If the friend's house isn't actually unsafe, then the parent's decision might be based on bias rather than safety. \n\nIn terms of the daughter's perspective, she's upset because her parent is interfering in her friendship. The parent's decision could be harming the daughter's emotional well-being if it's causing resentment or making her feel unsupported. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's reasoning might be seen as inconsiderate of the daughter's feelings and the friend's family, possibly rooted in prejudice, even if they claim otherwise. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
