My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The situation involves a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate, and the parent's reasoning about safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They mention supporting the friend's sexuality but are concerned about the environment when their daughter stays over. They also mention keeping their son away when the daughter is over, which is about providing a safe environment. The key points here are the parent's refusal based on the friend's family's potential inability to guarantee safety, which is vague. The parent's justification is about safety, but the example given is about their son, not the friend's house. \n\nNext, the daughter's friend is a 12-year-old as well. The parent is allowing their daughter to visit the friend's house but not stay overnight. The parent is not cutting off the friendship but is restricting sleepovers. The parent claims to support the friend but feels the environment isn't safe. However, the parent doesn't specify what exactly makes the friend's house unsafe. The \"coming out\" party was a surprise, and the parent found it inappropriate. \n\nFrom a general standpoint, parental decisions about their child's safety are often within their rights. However, the parent's reasoning here is a bit unclear. They mention their own home's safety measures but not the friend's. The friend's family's ability to provide a safe environment hasn't been objectively evaluated. The parent's discomfort with the \"coming out\" party might be influencing their decision, which could be seen as a personal bias rather than an actual safety concern. \n\nIn terms of public opinion, many would argue that supporting a child's friend, regardless of their family's orientation, is important for the child's social development. The parent's actions might be perceived as discriminatory, even if they claim not to be. The parent is making a decision based on their own feelings about the friend's family, not on any concrete evidence of danger. \n\nHowever, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. If the parent genuinely believes there's a risk, even if it's not clear to others, they might feel justified. The problem arises if the decision is based on prejudice rather than actual risk. The parent's explanation is a bit vague, focusing on their own home's safety measures rather than the friend's home's specifics. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the parent's reasoning is based on subjective feelings rather than concrete safety issues, the decision could be seen as discriminatory, and the parent's actions might harm the daughter's relationship. However, the parent isn't cutting off the friendship entirely, just sleepovers. The answer might depend on cultural context and societal norms. But in many modern contexts, supporting a child's friendships regardless of the other family's orientation is expected, making the parent in the wrong.\n"
