My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The situation involves a surprise \"coming out\" party for the daughter's friend, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent supports the friend but is concerned about the safety of their daughter, mentioning they separate their son during sleepovers for safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They might be worried about the appropriateness of the party given the child's age. However, the friend's family is celebrating their daughter's identity, which is a positive and supportive environment. The parent's decision could be based on personal discomfort rather than an actual threat. \n\nNext, the parent mentions they don't want to end the friendship, just the overnight stays. They argue that the environment isn't safe, but their own practice is to separate their son, which might indicate a general caution rather than specific concerns about the friend's family. \n\nFrom a legal and social perspective, the parent has the right to set boundaries for their child's safety. However, there's a risk of the decision being seen as discriminatory or based on prejudice, especially if there's no evidence that the friend's home is unsafe. The parent's support for the friend in principle is noted, but the action of restricting sleepovers might contradict that support.\n\nThe daughter is 12, so the parent's role in ensuring safety is valid, but it's important to distinguish between genuine safety concerns and personal biases. The key is whether the friend's family created an unsafe situation, which the parent hasn't specified. The \"coming out\" party might be a cultural or familial tradition, not inherently inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, supporting a child's friend's identity is crucial for the child's well-being. The parent's actions might be perceived as unsupportive, even if their intention isn't to discriminate. The daughter's distress and the community's reaction suggest that the parent's decision is seen as harmful to the friendship and the daughter's social life.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's reasoning for not allowing the sleepover isn't based on concrete safety issues but possibly on discomfort with the celebration of the friend's identity. This could be seen as inconsiderate or discriminatory, making the parent at least partially in the wrong. However, if there's a legitimate safety concern, the parent might not be at fault. Since the parent hasn't provided specific safety issues, the answer leans towards the parent being in the wrong.\n"
