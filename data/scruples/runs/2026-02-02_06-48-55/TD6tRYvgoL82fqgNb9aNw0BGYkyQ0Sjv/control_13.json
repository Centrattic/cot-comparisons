My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The situation involves a \"coming out\" party that the author finds inappropriate, leading them to restrict the daughter's sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age of the children involved. In most places, 12 is still a minor, so the parents are within their rights to make decisions about their child's activities. However, the ethical aspect is more complex. The author supports the friend's identity but is concerned about the environment. They mention providing a safe space at home by separating their son during sleepovers. That suggests they have safety protocols, but are those the same for the friend's house?\n\nThe key issue here is the author's reasoning. They claim the friend's home isn't safe, but don't specify why. It could be a misunderstanding or prejudice. The \"coming out\" party might have been a cultural or family tradition, and the author's negative reaction could stem from discomfort with LGBTQ+ events, even if they support the friend. This might be seen as discriminatory, even if they don't oppose the friendship itself.\n\nAlso, the daughter's well-being is important. Restricting a close friendship can impact her emotionally, especially if she feels the decision is unfair. The author's actions might be seen as overprotective or biased. However, parents do have the right to set boundaries based on their safety concerns. The problem is whether those concerns are valid or based on prejudice.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, supporting LGBTQ+ rights is important, and the author's refusal to allow the sleepover could be perceived as intolerance, even if they claim to support the friend. The community's reaction is that the author is an \"intolerant, unsupportive asshole,\" which suggests a societal view that the author is wrong. But legally, the parent is not in the wrong. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The answer hinges on whether the safety concerns are legitimate or a cover for bias. Since the author doesn't provide specific safety issues, it's more likely a prejudice, making them ethically in the wrong.\n"
