My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning is that they felt the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment, even though they support the friend's sexuality. They also mention separating their son during sleepovers, implying a similar safety concern.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might be worried about the environment being inappropriate for a child, but the friend is 12 and just came out. The parent is making a judgment about the friend's family based on a party that they considered inappropriate. However, the friend's family threw a coming out party to support their child, which is a positive and affirming gesture. The parent's decision could be misinterpreted as opposing the friend's sexuality, even though they claim to support it. \n\nOn the other hand, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. The parent mentions making arrangements for their son to be elsewhere during sleepovers, which shows they consider safety factors. But the key issue here is whether the parent's decision is based on legitimate safety concerns or on discomfort with the friend's family's support of their daughter's sexual orientation. \n\nThe parent's statement that the party was a \"shit show\" and \"trashy\" might indicate a lack of understanding or acceptance of the friend's identity, which could contribute to the decision being seen as discriminatory. The daughter is being punished for the friend's family's actions, which might not directly affect her safety. The parent's justification about a safe environment is vague without specific reasons like unsafe conditions, drugs, or abuse. \n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's actions seem more like a personal discomfort or misunderstanding about the friend's family supporting their sexuality rather than a genuine safety issue. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not allowing the sleepover based on these reasons.\n"
