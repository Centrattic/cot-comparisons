My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment. They mention that when their daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is intolerant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel that the friend's household isn't safe, maybe because of the \"coming out\" party they found inappropriate. The parent says they support the friend's sexuality but don't want their daughter to stay over. However, the parent's own actions involve moving their son out when the daughter stays, which could be seen as double standards. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's family threw a coming out party for their 12-year-old, which might be considered a supportive gesture. The parent is restricting their daughter's social life, which could be isolating. The parent's claim about safety isn't backed up by specific evidence, just their own discomfort. \n\nThe key points here are: the parent's support vs. actions, the daughter's well-being, and the concept of a \"safe environment.\" The parent's actions might be based on personal discomfort rather than actual safety concerns. Also, the parent's own practices (moving their son) could be seen as inconsistent. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, being supportive of a 12-year-old's sexual identity is generally encouraged. Limiting a child's social interactions without clear safety issues could be seen as overprotective or discriminatory. The parent's reasoning might be more about their own discomfort with the friend's openness, rather than genuine safety. \n\nHowever, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. The question is whether the parent's concerns are valid. Since there's no specific mention of unsafe behavior at the friend's house, it's possible the parent is projecting their own discomfort onto the situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's actions could be seen as inconsiderate and based on their own biases rather than actual safety. The daughter's emotional well-being is at risk if she's being restricted from a close friendship. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
