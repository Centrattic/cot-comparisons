My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent who decided not to allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay overnight at her lesbian friend's house after the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party that the parent found inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The parent supports the friend's sexuality but feels the home environment isn't safe. However, the parent also takes steps to ensure their own son isn't around when the daughter is over. The daughter is upset, and others think the parent is intolerant.\n\nHmm. The parent's reasoning is that they don't want to provide an unsafe environment. But the friend's family is celebrating their daughter's coming out. At 12, coming out is significant, and the parent might be overreacting. Maybe they're concerned about the party being too adult or inappropriate for a child. But the parent says they don't want to end the friendship, just the overnight stays. \n\nIs the parent's decision based on the friend's sexual orientation or on other factors? The parent mentions the whole thing felt \"trashy,\" which might imply discomfort with the celebration, possibly due to the topic being homosexuality. Even if the parent supports the friend, the action could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the parent is making a decision without considering the daughter's perspective, which might affect her social life and relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's safety. If the parent genuinely believes there's a risk, but the friend's family is just celebrating their daughter's identity, which is a normal family support event. The parent might be conflating their own discomfort with an actual safety issue. \n\nThe parent's reasoning could be viewed as hypocritical because they also make their son leave the house when the daughter is there, which might be similar to the friend's home setup. So if they're okay with their own son not being present, why is the friend's family's support of their daughter's sexuality an issue? \n\nAlso, the term \"coming out party\" at 12 might be a family event with other kids, not necessarily inappropriate. The parent's judgment might be based on their own biases rather than actual danger. \n\nIn most cases, supporting a child's friend's identity while restricting overnight stays without a valid safety concern could be seen as wrong. The parent's justification might not hold up if the friend's home isn't actually unsafe. So the answer is likely A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
