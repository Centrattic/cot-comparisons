My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, the daughter has been friends with this girl since kindergarten, and they're really close. The girl's parents had a coming out party for her, which the author found inappropriate. The parent says they don't want their daughter to sleep over there now. They mention supporting the girl's sexuality but think the environment isn't safe. They also have a son they move out when the daughter stays over.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about the parent's decision and their reasoning. The parent is concerned about the safety of their daughter, but the friend's family is celebrating their daughter's sexuality. The parent's argument is that they don't want to allow overnight stays because they feel the environment isn't safe, but they still support the friendship. \n\nWait, the parent says they support the girl and her happiness but don't trust the friend's home. But why? The coming out party was a positive event, just something the parents wanted to do. The parent might be conflating their discomfort with a same-sex celebration with safety concerns. Maybe they think that the friend's family is promoting something inappropriate for a 12-year-old, but that's not necessarily a safety issue. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions that when their daughter stays over, their son is elsewhere. They don't trust their son to be around the daughter, so they move him. That seems like a different scenario. But they're not trusting the friend's family. Is the author being inconsistent? If they trust their own son enough to move him, but don't trust the friend's family, maybe the issue isn't about safety in terms of harm, but about values or personal beliefs.\n\nThe parent's reasoning seems to be that the friend's family is not a safe environment, but the only reason given is the coming out party. That might not be a valid safety concern. It could be that the parent is uncomfortable with the friend's family's openness about their sexuality, leading them to deny their daughter overnight stays. However, the parent is allowing the friendship to continue, just not overnight. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, as long as the friend's family is providing a safe environment, the parent's refusal might be based on personal bias rather than actual danger. The parent's support of the girl's sexuality is stated, but their action is seen as unsupportive. The daughter is upset because she's close to this friend. \n\nSo, the parent's decision is based on a subjective feeling of safety that may not be justified. The coming out party isn't a safety issue but a celebration. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong for denying the daughter the sleepover based on their discomfort rather than actual risk. Hence, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
