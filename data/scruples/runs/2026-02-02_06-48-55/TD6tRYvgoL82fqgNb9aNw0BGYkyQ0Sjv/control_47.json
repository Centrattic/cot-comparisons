My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The author's reasoning is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment, similar to how they move their son out when their daughter stays over. But the daughter's parents threw a \"coming out\" party, which the author found inappropriate for a 12-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter and her friend are close since kindergarten. The key points are the author's objection to the \"coming out\" party and the safety concern. The author claims they support the friend but don't want their daughter to stay over. However, they don't trust the friend's family's environment. \n\nNow, legal and societal norms. In many places, 12 is a common age for children to have friends over. The \"coming out\" party might be a celebration of the friend's identity, which the author finds premature. But the author's daughter's friend is part of the LGBTQ+ community, and the author is okay with the friendship but not with the overnight stay. The author's justification is about safety, comparing it to moving their son out. But is there a valid reason to not trust the friend's family? The author hasn't provided specific safety issues, like known risks or unsafe practices. \n\nAlso, the author says they support the girl's happiness but don't want the daughter staying over. That could be seen as contradictory. The daughter feels the parent is being intolerant. The parent's reasoning about safety might be a guise for discomfort with the friend's sexuality or the family's celebration. The parent's own actions (moving their son out) don't indicate a problem with the friend's family's safety measures. \n\nIn terms of child welfare, the parent's decision to restrict the daughter's social life might be harmful. Restricting a child's autonomy and social interactions without a concrete reason can affect their trust and emotional well-being. The parent's actions could be seen as discriminatory, even if they claim support. The key here is whether the safety concern is genuine or a pretext for bias. Since the parent hasn't mentioned specific safety issues, it's questionable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because their decision could be based on prejudice rather than a legitimate safety concern. The daughter's right to socialize with friends is important, and the parent's actions might be unsupported by actual risks. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
