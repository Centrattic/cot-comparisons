My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The parent's reasoning is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment. But wait, the parent mentions that when their daughter stays over, they make sure their son is elsewhere. The parent supports the friend and isn't ending the friendship, just the sleepovers.\n\nFirst, the parent's concern about safety. However, the parent doesn't specify any actual risk at the friend's house. They just feel it's unsafe. On the other hand, their own safety measures involve their son being away, which implies they have a standard for safety that might apply to any sleepover, not just this one. So maybe they're being inconsistent here. \n\nThe friend's family had a coming out party for their daughter. The parent finds it \"trashy\" and questions celebrating a child's sexuality. This suggests some discomfort with the friend's identity, even if they claim support. The parent's justification for not allowing the sleepover might be rooted in prejudice rather than an actual safety issue. \n\nThe parent is causing the daughter emotional distress by cutting off sleepovers, which are important for her social development. The daughter is close to her friend, and this decision is making her hate her parent. The parent claims to support the friend but is acting in a way that could be seen as undermining the friendship. \n\nThe key here is whether the parent's \"safe environment\" concern is legitimate. If there's no actual evidence that the friend's house is unsafe, then the parent's decision might be based on bias. The parent's own safety measures (moving their son) aren't mentioned as applying to the friend's situation, which suggests the parent is applying different standards. \n\nSo, the parent's actions could be seen as discriminatory, even if they claim support. They're making a decision that affects the daughter's relationships without valid safety concerns. The daughter is 12, and parental decisions should consider her emotional well-being and the importance of her friendships. Therefore, the parent is likely in the wrong.\n"
