My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent mentions that they support the friend and her sexuality but feel the environment isn't safe now because of the \"coming out party.\" They also mention separating their son when the daughter is over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They're concerned about safety, but their justification centers around the friend's family environment post-coming out party. However, the parent doesn't provide specific safety issues, like unsafe practices or behaviors at the friend's house. It seems more like a general discomfort or judgment about the celebration itself. The parent is conflating support for the friend's identity with a perceived unsafe environment, which might not be a valid reason.\n\nThe daughter is 12, so she's in middle school, and the coming out party could be a significant event for the friend. The parent's decision might be seen as undermining the daughter's friendship and sending a message that the friend's family isn't acceptable. Even if the parent claims support, the action of not allowing the sleepover could be interpreted as not supporting the friend's identity. The parent also mentions separating their son during sleepovers, which is normal for parents to ensure privacy, but it doesn't relate to the same issue here.\n\nThe parent's neighbors and others think they're intolerant, which the parent denies. However, the action itself\u2014denying a sleepover based on the friend's sexuality without specific safety concerns\u2014can be seen as discriminatory. The parent's reasoning lacks concrete examples of danger, making it seem more like a personal bias. The daughter's reaction and the parent's lack of trust in the friend's family despite supporting the friend's identity further complicate the matter.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's decision is likely based on prejudice rather than actual safety concerns. They didn't address the daughter's feelings adequately and may have failed to support her friend properly. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
