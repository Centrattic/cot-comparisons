My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable for a parent to prevent their 12-year-old daughter from staying overnight at her lesbian friend's house.\n\nFirst, the parent's reasoning is that they don't want their daughter to stay overnight at the friend's home because they found the friend's family's \"coming out party\" inappropriate. The parent is concerned about the safety of their daughter, mentioning that they make sure their son isn't present when their daughter is over. The parent clarifies they support the friend's sexuality but don't want their daughter around the environment they perceive as unsafe.\n\nNow, I need to consider a few factors. First, the age of the children. At 12, they're pre-teens, and parents often have concerns about their safety and the influence of friends' homes. However, the parent's issue seems to be with the friend's family's celebration of the child's sexuality, which they found \"trashy.\" This could imply a judgment of the friend's family based on their child's identity, even though the parent claims to support the child.\n\nThe key here is whether the parent's decision is based on the actual safety of the environment or on their personal discomfort with the friend's family's expression of their child's identity. The parent mentions that they separate their own children during sleepovers, which might not be the same issue. If the parent is making a decision based on the friend's family's values or lifestyle rather than any specific unsafe conditions (like drug use, abuse, etc.), then it's more about personal intolerance rather than genuine safety.\n\nAdditionally, the parent is being criticized as an \"intolerant, unsupportive asshole,\" which suggests that others see the decision as discriminatory. The parent argues they are supporting the friend's happiness but not allowing the sleepover. However, if the friend's family is open and supportive, the parent's refusal could be seen as rejecting the friend's identity or the family's support for their child.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's perspective. The parent is affecting her close friendship, which is important for her social development. The parent's rationale might not consider the child's emotional needs and the importance of maintaining such friendships.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's safety. But if the decision is based on prejudice against the friend's family because of their child's sexuality, it's a different matter. The parent claims they don't oppose the friendship but the environment, but their actions might be conflating the two.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? If they are denying the sleepover due to the friend's family being supportive of their child's identity, that could be seen as discriminatory. However, if there's a legitimate safety concern, like the parent has specific reasons to believe the environment is unsafe (which isn't detailed here), then it might not be. The scenario as presented doesn't mention any specific safety risks beyond the parent's discomfort with the party. Therefore, it's more likely the parent is acting on their own biases rather than actual safety issues, making them in the wrong.\n"
