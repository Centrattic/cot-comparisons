My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable for a parent to prevent their 12-year-old daughter from staying overnight at her friend's house after the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that the party felt \"trashy\" and questioned why a 12-year-old's sexuality is being celebrated. But they clarify they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship. The key point is their concern about safety when the daughter stays over. The parent also mentions they keep their son away during overnight visits to ensure a safe environment for their daughter.\n\nSo, the parent's main argument is about safety, not the friend's sexual orientation. However, others might see this as discriminatory, especially since the parent supports the friendship otherwise. The parent isn't objecting to the friend being lesbian but to the party. But the problem is whether the party itself is a valid reason to deny an overnight stay.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. At 12, kids are often exploring their identities, and parents might have different views on handling that. The parent's decision might be seen as overprotective or as a way to avoid a situation they're uncomfortable with. But if the parent is genuinely concerned about safety, maybe they have a point. However, the parent's mention of separating their son during overnights suggests that safety is a priority, but the reasoning for the friend's house might be different. \n\nIs the parent's concern about safety legitimate? If the party was a one-time event and the friend's home is otherwise safe, maybe not. But the parent might feel that the environment isn't appropriate for their daughter's age. However, the parent isn't opposed to the friendship, just the overnight. It's possible they're using safety as a reason to avoid dealing with their discomfort about the party or the friend's sexuality.\n\nAlso, the parent's statement that they \"totally support\" the friend might not align with their action, which could be seen as discriminatory. Even if the parent claims they're not intolerant, others might perceive the action as such. The daughter's reaction (hating the parent) suggests that the decision hurt her feelings, which is a common reaction when parental decisions are perceived as unfair.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's safety. But if the decision is based on bias rather than an actual safety concern, it could be seen as wrong. The parent's reasoning here is a bit ambiguous. They mention the party being a \"shit show\" but don't provide specific safety issues like drugs, alcohol, or inappropriate behavior. Without concrete reasons, the decision might be viewed as unjustified, especially if other parents would allow similar situations.\n\nSo, the parent's justification hinges on safety, but without clear evidence of a real threat, others might think the parent is making a judgment based on prejudice. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong if their decision is influenced by discomfort with the friend's sexuality rather than actual safety concerns. However, if they genuinely believe that the environment after the party is unsafe, they have a case. But the way they phrased it, focusing on the celebration of sexuality at such a young age, seems more about personal discomfort than safety. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because their reasoning could be seen as discriminatory and not based on real safety issues. But if the parent's concern is legitimate, then B. But given the lack of specific safety issues mentioned, it's more likely A.\n"
