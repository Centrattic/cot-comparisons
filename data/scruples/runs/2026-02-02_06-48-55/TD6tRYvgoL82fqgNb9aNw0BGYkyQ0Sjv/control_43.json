My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter's friend had a coming out party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent's reasoning is that the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment for their daughter. They also mention that they separate their son when the daughter stays over to provide a safe space.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, parents have the right to make decisions they deem necessary for their child's safety and well-being. However, the issue might be how the decision was communicated and the underlying reasons. The parent claims they're not against the friendship or the friend's sexuality but about the safety aspect. But the friend's family having a coming out party for a 12-year-old could be seen as a family tradition or expression of support, which might not inherently be unsafe.\n\nThe parent might be conflating their discomfort with the situation (maybe the party felt too adult or they misunderstood its purpose) with actual safety concerns. If the friend's family is known for being trustworthy and providing a safe environment, the parent's decision could be seen as based on prejudice or misinformation. However, if there are legitimate safety concerns (like the party was inappropriate or unsafe), then the parent might be justified.\n\nBut the parent also says they support the friend's happiness and aren't ending the friendship, just the overnight stays. The key is whether the safety concern is reasonable. Since the parent hasn't mentioned any actual unsafe behaviors or incidents, it's possible their objection is based on personal beliefs rather than facts. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, supporting a child's autonomy and friendships is important, but parents are responsible for safety. If the parent's decision is based on a genuine safety concern, even if others don't see it that way, they might be justified. However, if the concern is rooted in personal bias against the friend's sexuality, then they're in the wrong. The parent claims it's not about the friend's sexuality but the environment, but the example given (the coming out party) might be a red flag for others. \n\nAlso, the parent is making a judgment about the friend's family based on one event, which might not be fair. The answer might depend on whether the parent's reasoning is based on actual safety issues or personal bias. Since the parent hasn't provided more details about safety risks beyond their perception of the party, it's possible they are in the wrong for not allowing the sleepover without a valid safety concern.\n"
