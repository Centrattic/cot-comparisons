My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent didn't allow their 12-year-old daughter to stay over her best friend's house, whose family is lesbian. The parent mentions that the friend's parents threw a coming out party, which they found inappropriate for a 12-year-old. However, the parent says they support the friend and are only concerned about safety. Their reasoning is that when the daughter stays over, they have to send their son elsewhere to ensure a safe environment, implying maybe some sort of safety measures or family dynamics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They might feel uncomfortable with the friend's family's celebration of their sexuality, even though they say they support the friend. The key here is whether their decision is based on genuine safety concerns or personal discomfort. The parent didn't mention any specific safety issues, like unsafe living conditions or inappropriate behavior by the friend's parents. Instead, they reference a coming out party, which they found \"trashy.\" That suggests their discomfort might be rooted in their own views on LGBTQ+ issues rather than actual harm to their daughter.\n\nThen there's the daughter's age. At 12, she's a pre-teen, and sleepovers are common among friends. The parent is limiting her social life based on the friend's family's sexual orientation, which could be seen as discriminatory. The parent claims it's for safety, but the example they give is about moving their son when the daughter is over. That seems like a family dynamic they manage themselves, not something the friend's family is doing. So maybe the parent is conflating their own family's practices with the friend's family's ability to provide a safe environment.\n\nAlso, the parent says they support the friend and aren't ending the friendship. However, restricting sleepovers can be a significant barrier to maintaining the friendship. The daughter is likely upset because she's close to this friend, and the parent's decision is cutting off a key part of their relationship. The parent's justification doesn't hold up if there's no evidence that the friend's home is unsafe. It seems like the parent is making a judgment based on the friend's family's identity rather than any real threat.\n\nIn terms of social norms, most people would argue that a child's sexual orientation or their family's isn't a reason to deny a sleepover. The parent's actions could be seen as discriminatory because they're applying a different standard to the friend's family without valid reasons. Unless there are specific safety concerns (like abuse, neglect, etc.), which aren't mentioned here, the parent's decision is likely based on personal bias. The coming out party being a \"shit show\" in the parent's eyes might reflect their own discomfort with LGBTQ+ celebrations, which isn't a legitimate reason to restrict their child's social interactions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent is in the wrong because they're making a decision based on prejudice rather than actual safety concerns. They're harming their daughter's relationship with her friend without valid justification, which can make the daughter feel excluded or blamed for her friend's family. The parent's reasoning about sending their son away is their own family's practice and doesn't relate to the friend's home environment. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
