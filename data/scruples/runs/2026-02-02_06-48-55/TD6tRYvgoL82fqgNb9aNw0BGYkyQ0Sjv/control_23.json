My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house. The parent says they support the friend and her sexuality but feels the environment isn't safe for their daughter. They also mention they keep their son away when the daughter stays over.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They don't want to allow the daughter to stay at the lesbian friend's house because they think the environment is unsafe. But how can a lesbian couple's home be unsafe? Maybe the parent is uncomfortable with their daughter being in a same-sex household, but that could be bias. Also, the parent mentions they support the friend, so maybe they are conflicted between their personal feelings and their support.\n\nThe daughter's close friendship is important. Denying a sleepover might make the daughter feel rejected, especially when the friend's family is celebrating her identity with a \"coming out\" party. At 12, kids are starting to form their own identities, and the parent's refusal could be seen as not supporting their daughter's friendship or the friend's identity.\n\nThe parent's argument about safety is a red flag. It might be a way to avoid dealing with their discomfort. If the parent is okay with the daughter being at the friend's house during the day but not overnight, that inconsistency could indicate the issue isn't safety but personal bias. Also, the parent's practice of keeping their son away when the daughter stays over suggests they might be more concerned about their own children's presence than the daughter's safety elsewhere.\n\nAnother angle: the parent's statement about supporting the friend's happiness but not allowing the sleepover could be contradictory. If the friend's family is a safe and supportive environment, withholding sleepovers might be seen as not supporting the friendship. The community's backlash makes the parent feel accused, but maybe that's because their reasoning is perceived as discriminatory.\n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, it's about the parent's right to make decisions for their child versus the child's autonomy in friendships. At 12, the parent has the authority, but the approach taken might be harmful if it's based on prejudice. The parent needs to address their own biases to ensure they're not projecting discomfort onto their child's safety.\n\nSo considering all this, the parent's reasoning might be rooted in intolerance or discomfort with same-sex relationships, even if they claim support. Therefore, the answer would be that the parent is in the wrong (A).\n"
