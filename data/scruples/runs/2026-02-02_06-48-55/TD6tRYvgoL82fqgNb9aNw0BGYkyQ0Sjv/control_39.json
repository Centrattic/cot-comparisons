My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their 12-year-old daughter to stay at her lesbian friend's house. The situation involves a parent making a decision based on their discomfort with the friend's family's celebration of their child's sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. The parent mentions they support the friend and hope they find happiness but feel the environment isn't safe for their daughter. However, the friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party, which the parent found inappropriate. The parent also mentioned that when their daughter stays over, they make sure their son is away, implying they separate the kids for safety. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the parent's concerns are valid. The daughter is 12, which is a young age, but friendships at that age are significant. The parent's issue seems to be with the public celebration of the friend's sexuality, which might be a cultural or personal discomfort rather than an actual safety issue. The parent claims the friend's family can't guarantee a safe environment, but they don't specify any particular reason like substance abuse, unsafe activities, or inappropriate content at the party. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents have the right to make decisions about their child's safety and well-being. However, if the decision is based on the friend's sexual orientation without any concrete safety concerns, it could be seen as discriminatory. The parent's statement that they don't want to terminate the friendship is important, but their action of not allowing overnight stays might inadvertently be a form of social restriction based on sexual orientation, which can be harmful to the child's emotional well-being and sense of acceptance. \n\nAlso, considering the daughter's age, same-sex relationships or identities are about forming one's identity, and such restrictions might lead to feelings of rejection or confusion. The parent's justification about safety seems to be a red herring, as they separate their own children during such visits, which might not be related to the friend's family's sexual orientation but rather a general approach to managing sibling dynamics.\n\nSo, the parent is not in the wrong in terms of legal or explicit safety, but from a social and emotional perspective, their reasoning appears to be based on prejudice rather than actual risk. This could affect the daughter's ability to form a healthy friendship and support system, which is crucial at her age. Therefore, the answer would be A (the parent is in the wrong) because their decision seems to stem from intolerance rather than genuine safety concerns.\n"
