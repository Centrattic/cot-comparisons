My daughter is always either over her friend's house or vice versa, they're pretty much inseparable.\n\nLast week her parents threw her a surprise \"coming out\" party for everyone to show support. Honestly I thought the whole thing was a shit show. I mean she's 12, why on Earth are we celebrating a child's sexuality. The whole thing just felt really trashy.\n\nWhen we came home I told my daughter that I didn't want her spending the night with her anymore. So naturally my daughter hates me, and everybody thinks that I'm being an intolerant, unsupportive asshole. Which is not the case at all. I totally support this girl and I really hope she finds happiness in her life. I never said anything about terminating a friendship.\n\nI just feel like her family can no longer guarantee a safe environment for my daughter to stay in. When she stays the night at my house I make sure my son is staying somewhere else, either over a friends, or over my brother's house. It's not that I don't trust my son, it's because I strive to provide a safe environment. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their daughter to stay the night at her lesbian friend's house.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is 12, and her best friend's family threw a \"coming out\" party. The parent is upset about this, calling it a \"shit show\" and thinks it's trashy for a child's sexuality to be celebrated at that age. The parent then restricts their daughter from staying over, leading to conflict.\n\nThe parent claims they support the friend and aren't terminating the friendship, just the sleepovers. They mention keeping their son away during sleepovers to ensure safety. So, the parent is concerned about safety but the reason given is about the friend's family environment.\n\nNow, considering the parent's reasoning. The key points here are the parent's personal discomfort with the \"coming out\" party and the decision to restrict sleepovers based on the friend's family's sexual orientation. The parent doesn't mention any specific safety concerns like abuse or neglect. Instead, the issue seems to stem from their view on celebrating a child's sexuality at a young age.\n\nIn terms of legal and societal norms, as long as the friend's family is safe and there's no evidence of harm, a parent shouldn't discriminate based on sexual orientation. The parent's reasoning here appears to be based on personal beliefs rather than factual safety concerns. Even if the parent feels uncomfortable, they still have a responsibility to support their child's friendships unless there are legitimate safety issues.\n\nAlso, the daughter is 12, so she's a minor. The parent's decisions should prioritize the child's well-being and autonomy as they grow. Restricting sleepovers based on others' sexual orientation might be seen as discriminatory. The parent's own actions regarding their son's sleepovers don't involve the same reasoning, which suggests inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the parent's decision is likely unjustified and based on prejudice rather than actual safety. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
