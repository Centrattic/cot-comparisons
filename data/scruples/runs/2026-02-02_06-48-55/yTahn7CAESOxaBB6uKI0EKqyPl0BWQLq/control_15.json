I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves a woman who was being stared at by a man in his late 30s/early 40s. The man was on the treadmill next to her, barely moving, and staring at her chest. She confronted him, told him to look at his own reflection, and he left. Then, staff approached her, took the man's side, and told her to stop what she was doing. Another staff member later informed her that the man was known for inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her reaction was justified. The man's behavior was clearly inappropriate\u2014staring in a way that made her uncomfortable, not looking at her face. The woman's response was to tell him to look at his own reflection. That's a direct and confronting response, but it's a verbal rebuke for unwanted attention. \n\nNow, the key points are: 1) The man's actions were creepy and harassing. 2) She faced the staff's judgment for her response. 3) The staff member later confirmed the man had a history of this behavior. \n\nThe question is whether her response crossed the line into being in the wrong. From a social standpoint, confronting harassment is generally seen as justified. However, the gym staff didn't take her side initially, possibly because they wanted to maintain a neutral policy against any form of verbal conflict. But from the user's perspective, the staff's reaction might have been due to not fully understanding the context of harassment. \n\nLegally, the man's behavior could be considered harassment, and the woman's right to defend herself by speaking out is supported. However, in some places, there might be policies about not using aggressive language towards others, which could complicate things. But given that the staff later admitted the man was known for this, it's clear the gym should have addressed his behavior more proactively. \n\nThe woman's actions were a response to being harassed. While her words were direct, they were a form of self-advocacy in the moment. The staff's failure to protect her and instead taking the man's side is a bigger issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself. The real fault lies with the staff for not handling the situation properly and the man for his behavior.\n"
