I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves a woman who felt uncomfortable because a man was staring at her inappropriately. She confronted him with a sarcastic remark, which led to staff taking her side against her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man's behavior was inappropriate\u2014staring and not engaging in proper use of the treadmill. The woman felt threatened and uncomfortable. Her response was direct and confrontational, which might be seen as justified given the situation. However, using a derogatory comment could be viewed as crossing a line, depending on cultural or personal standards.\n\nBut then, the staff took the man's side, which might indicate they didn't see the harassment and instead saw the woman's response as bullying. This could be because the staff might not have the full context of the harassment, only the verbal exchange. The woman's action led to a conflict with gym policy, even if the man's behavior was the root issue.\n\nThe key points here are the man's inappropriate behavior versus the woman's response. While the man was the initial aggressor, the woman's choice to confront him in a public, verbal manner might not align with the gym's policies. The staff's reaction suggests that they prioritize maintaining order and preventing conflicts over addressing harassment, which is a common but problematic approach.\n\nHowever, the woman's motivation was self-defense against harassment. She tried to ignore him first, then turned off her treadmill, and finally spoke up. Her use of a direct and possibly insulting remark was a way to end the situation quickly. The question is whether her response was reasonable given the circumstances. In many cases, people might argue that she was within her rights to defend herself from unwanted attention, but others might say she should have involved staff immediately to avoid confrontation.\n\nThe staff's failure to acknowledge the harassment and instead reprimanding the victim is a critical part. This scenario highlights a common issue where victims are blamed for responding to harassment, which is not right. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the staff's handling. The woman's actions were a reaction to being harassed, so while her method might be questionable, the root issue was the man's inappropriate behavior.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a nuanced situation. The woman's intent was to stop harassment, but her method led to a conflict. However, given the context, her reaction is more about defending herself than being inconsiderate. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
