I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation is that a man was staring at her, and she responded by telling him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body. Then, the gym staff took her to task for bullying him, but later found out he's a known creep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman felt uncomfortable and was being harassed. The man's behavior was inappropriate, and she reacted in the moment. The gym staff initially sided with him, but another staff member later confirmed he's known for such behavior.\n\nThe key points here are: self-defense in a harassment situation, use of language, and the appropriateness of the response. Legally, is there a wrong here? In many places, harassment is a serious issue, and the woman's reaction could be seen as a reasonable response to being targeted. However, the way she addressed it was confrontational and used a derogatory term. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, defending oneself against harassment is understandable. But the method\u2014using an insult\u2014might be seen as the wrong approach, even if the underlying issue was valid. The gym staff might have policies against aggressive language, even if the staff's judgment was incorrect in the initial assessment.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the man was indeed harassing her, her reaction was justified in terms of self-advocacy. However, the way she handled it could be seen as crossing a line into personal insult rather than addressing the inappropriate behavior. The gym might have rules against such language, regardless of the situation. On the other hand, if the staff was incorrect in their initial response, maybe the fault lies more with their judgment than her reaction. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might depend on societal norms and the specific policies of the gym. The woman likely did the right thing in standing up for herself given the harassment, but the method might not be the best approach in a public, professional setting. However, given that the other man was a known creep, her response was a self-protective measure. The staff's initial reaction might be part of the problem, but the question is about her being in the wrong. So, probably not in the wrong because she was responding to harassment, even if the response was unorthodox.\n"
