I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a man who was staring at her at the gym. The situation involves a woman who was uncomfortable with a man's behavior and responded by telling him to look at his own reflection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was described as staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. The author tried to ignore him but eventually confronted him. The staff took the man's side, possibly because they didn't have enough evidence of harassment. The other staff member mentioned he was known for such behavior, which adds context about the man's history.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author's response was justified. The author used a direct and somewhat aggressive retort, which led to the staff accusing her of bullying. However, the follow-up from another staff member validates her suspicion about the man's behavior, suggesting that the initial staff might not have handled it correctly.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the man's actions were indeed harassment, the author might have had the right to defend herself. But public confrontation can sometimes be seen as inappropriate. However, given that the man was being invasive and the author felt threatened, her reaction could be seen as a form of self-defense. The staff's initial response was to side with the man, which might indicate that policies are in place to handle such situations, but if the man has a history, the staff might not have acted swiftly enough.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often have different opinions on how to handle harassment. Some might argue that confronting the harasser directly is effective, while others might suggest reporting it immediately. The author's method worked in that the man left, but it resulted in her being reprimanded.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's intent was to stop harassment, which is not her fault. However, the method she used (insulting him) might have been unprofessional or against gym policies. But the core issue is the man's behavior. So the author isn't in the wrong for defending herself, even if the gym's response was inadequate. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
