I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation is that a woman was at the gym, and a man started staring at her. She confronted him, told him to look at his own reflection, and then the gym staff took her side when the man complained. She's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The woman was in an uncomfortable situation with someone staring inappropriately. She tried to ignore him but when it became too much, she responded. The man's behavior was clearly inappropriate\u2014staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. She used a sarcastic comment to make him stop, which worked. However, the gym staff took the man's side, which is frustrating for her.\n\nNow, from a legal and ethical standpoint, the man's behavior is the issue here. Staring in a way that makes someone uncomfortable, especially if it's objectifying, is a form of harassment. The woman had a right to feel unsafe and to defend herself. But the staff's reaction is important. They might have policies against aggressive language or confrontations, even if the underlying issue is the man's behavior. The woman's response was direct but could be seen as aggressive. However, given the context of harassment, her reaction might be justified as self-defense in terms of setting boundaries.\n\nThe key points are the man's inappropriate behavior versus the woman's response. While the woman's language might not be the most professional or respectful, the root cause is the man's actions. The gym's failure to address the man's behavior adequately is also part of the problem here. The woman was trying to protect herself in a situation where the gym didn't step in. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the woman isn't in the wrong for defending herself against harassment. The gym staff should have supported her and addressed the man's behavior. Her comment was a reaction to being made to feel uncomfortable, and while it might not be the most ideal way to handle it, it's understandable given the circumstances. The real issue is the man's actions and the gym's inadequate response to it. Therefore, the woman isn't in the wrong; she was responding to harassment, which is a valid concern.\n"
