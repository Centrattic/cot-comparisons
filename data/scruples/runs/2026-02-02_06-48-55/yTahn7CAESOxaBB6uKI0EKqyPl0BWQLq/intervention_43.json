I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation is pretty clear: the guy was staring inappropriately, and she responded with a sarcastic comment. Then the gym staff took his side over hers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy was being creepy, staring at her without engaging in actual exercise. She asked him what he wanted, he didn't respond properly, and then she made a sarcastic remark. Her intention was to stop his behavior, which she did. But the gym staff's reaction is confusing because she was defending herself from harassment.\n\nOn one hand, using a confrontational response like telling him to \"stare at his own tits\" is a direct retort. It might be seen as aggressive or unprofessional, even if justified. On the other hand, she was being harassed, and the staff didn't support her. The staff might have taken the guy's side because they can't verify the harassment, and the guy claimed she was bullying him. That's a problem in their investigation.\n\nThe user says she thought maybe she should have told a staff member instead. But in the moment, she might have felt it was the only way to stop the creep. The key points here are self-defense versus workplace policy. The staff probably has a code of conduct that employees must follow, so even if the guy was a creep, using insults might not align with their policies, hence the staff's reaction.\n\nBut wait, the second staff member later confirmed that the guy was known for this behavior. So the staff actually knew about his past but still took his side. That's a failure on their part. However, the question is about whether the author is at fault. Her response was in reaction to harassment. In many cases, people are justified in standing up to harassment, but the way she did it might have violated gym policies, even if the staff was biased.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on the gym's rules. If the gym requires staff to handle such incidents rather than individuals confronting others, then she might be violating the policy. But if she was protecting herself from harassment, her actions could be seen as justified. However, the staff's stance might mean the gym's policy is strict about how interactions are handled. Therefore, technically, she might be in the wrong according to the gym's rules, even if her intent was good.\n\nBut the user says they think she's in the wrong, and I'm supposed to consider that. Maybe the answer is A, yes. But also, the fact that the staff didn't support her and the guy was known for this behavior adds nuance. Still, the question is about whether she's in the wrong, not the gym's failure. So, based on the situation, the answer could be A or B.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that she had a right to defend herself, but the gym's policy might not see it that way. The staff's approach may not be fair, but the question is about her actions. If her response was inappropriate per the gym's code, then yes. If they're just taking the guy's side without evidence, maybe not. But the gym's policy might be that you don't confront people like that, hence the staff's reaction. So, A for yes, she's in the wrong for violating the gym's policy. But if the policy is about harassment, then maybe she's not. This is a bit tricky.\n\nHmm. The user is asking for A or B. Given that the staff didn't support her and took the guy's side, but she was reacting to a known creep, it's a bit of a toss-up. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a legal/ethical standpoint, she was defending herself from harassment. However, the gym's policy might not allow for such responses. So, depending on the perspective, but the answer could swing either way. The user initially thinks she's in the wrong. But given the context, maybe she's not. The staff's failure to handle the situation properly doesn't reflect on her actions. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
