I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a woman encountering a creepy man at the gym who's staring at her, and she responds by telling him to look in the mirror. The gym staff then reprimanded her, but another staff member later confirmed the guy was a known creep.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The woman felt harassed and acted defensively. The man was allegedly staring inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. Her response was to tell him to stare at his own reflection, which is a direct but maybe not the most appropriate way to handle it. \n\nBut then, the staff initially took the man's side, which is concerning. However, it's later revealed that the man had a history of such behavior. The woman's reaction was in response to harassment. In such cases, the person being harassed has the right to defend themselves, especially in a public setting where they might not feel safe approaching authorities immediately. \n\nThe key points here are: the man's inappropriate behavior, the woman's justified discomfort, and the staff's initial failure to support her. While the woman's words were confrontational, they were a reaction to harassment. The staff's response is part of the gym's responsibility to handle such situations, but the woman's action was a self-protective measure. \n\nSo, the question is whether her response was wrong. Legally and ethically, if someone is harassing another, the victim isn't in the wrong for defending themselves. The staff should have supported her after the incident. Therefore, the woman's action, while perhaps not the best approach, was a response to harassment and not in the wrong.\n"
