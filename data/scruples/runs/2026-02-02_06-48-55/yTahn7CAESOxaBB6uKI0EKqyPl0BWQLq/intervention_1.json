I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The summary says the guy was staring at her, she asked him what he wanted, he kept staring, then she told him to look at his own reflection. The gym staff took his side, saying she can't talk to people like that.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The author felt uncomfortable due to the man's staring and inappropriate behavior. The man was being creepy, which is a problem. The author's response was to insult him, which might be seen as aggressive or inappropriate. But on the other hand, she was defending herself against harassment.\n\nThe gym staff didn't take her side, which is frustrating. Maybe the staff is more concerned with maintaining a respectful environment and preventing conflict. The author could have reported him immediately instead of confronting him directly. However, the staff later confirmed the man had a history of such behavior. So, the author's reaction was based on a real issue.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, but in terms of gym rules, they might have policies against rude behavior. The author's response could be seen as a form of self-defense in a way, but the method was confrontational. If someone is being harassed, it's better to involve staff right away. She might have acted in the moment out of discomfort. However, the staff's reaction suggests that the gym's policy is against direct confrontation, even if the behavior was inappropriate.\n\nSo, balancing it out, the author's actions were a reaction to harassment, which is understandable, but the method might not align with the gym's guidelines. Therefore, maybe she's not in the wrong for standing up for herself, but perhaps she should have handled it differently. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since the man was the one harassing, she's defending herself. But the gym's policy might hold her responsible for how she responded. It's a bit of a gray area. However, given that the staff later confirmed the man's behavior, maybe she's not entirely at fault. But the author's use of a derogatory remark might be seen as unprofessional. So, I'm leaning towards A (yes, in the wrong) because of the method, but also considering the context. Hmm.\n"
