I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for insulting a man at the gym who was staring at her. The key points here are about boundaries, harassment, and appropriate responses.\n\nFirst, the man was allegedly staring at her in a creepy way, which made her uncomfortable. She tried to ignore him, then turned off her treadmill to ask him what he wanted. He didn't respond appropriately and continued to stare. She then insulted him, which led to the staff taking her side in favor of the man, which seems unfair.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But considering the context, the man's behavior is problematic. Staring inappropriately is harassment, and the staff's response seems to downplay her experience. The author's reaction, while direct, was in response to harassment. However, using a confrontational approach might not have been the best way, as it could escalate the situation. But given the staff's bias towards the man, maybe she had limited options.\n\nLegally and ethically, harassment is a serious issue. The staff should have addressed the man's behavior instead of blaming the woman. The author's response, though not ideal, was a reaction to being harassed. So, it's more about the man's wrongdoing and the staff's failure to handle it properly. The author isn't in the wrong for defending herself against harassment.\n"
