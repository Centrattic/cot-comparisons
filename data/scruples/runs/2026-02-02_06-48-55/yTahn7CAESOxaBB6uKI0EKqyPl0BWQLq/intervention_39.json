I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a woman at the gym was being stared at by a man, who was looking at her chest. She confronted him, told him to look in the mirror and stare at his own, and then later got reprimanded by staff who took the man's side. The woman is now wondering if she was wrong to respond that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was being creepy and invasive, staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. His behavior is clearly inappropriate. From a bystander's perspective, objectifying someone by staring without consent is wrong. The woman felt threatened or uncomfortable, which is valid.\n\nNow, her response was to insult him. She used a retort that was direct and confrontational. The question is whether that response crosses the line into being inconsiderate or aggressive. On one hand, she was defending herself against harassment. On the other hand, her response might be seen as a verbal attack, even if it was in response to his behavior.\n\nIn terms of gym policies, if the staff has rules about how members interact, they might have a policy against aggressive language. The staff's reaction could be based on maintaining order, not necessarily taking sides. The woman might have escalated the situation by confronting him directly, which could be against the gym's rules, even if the man was the initial aggressor.\n\nHowever, the man's behavior is the root issue here. He was the one engaging in inappropriate staring, which is a form of harassment. The woman's reaction, while maybe not the best approach, was a response to being harassed. The staff's failure to address the man's behavior and instead reprimanding her could indicate a lack of support for victims in such situations.\n\nDifferent perspectives matter here. Legally, the man's behavior might be considered harassment, but the gym's policies might not have clear procedures for handling such cases. The woman's verbal response was a direct confrontation, which might not be the most effective way to handle it, but it's understandable given the stress and discomfort she felt.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym's rules prohibit aggressive communication, then technically yes. But morally and in terms of social context, she was responding to harassment. The staff's handling of the situation is questionable because they took the man's side without fully investigating. The key point is that the man's behavior is the real issue, and the woman was defending herself against it. Therefore, while her method might not have been ideal, she wasn't in the wrong in terms of self-defense against harassment.\n"
