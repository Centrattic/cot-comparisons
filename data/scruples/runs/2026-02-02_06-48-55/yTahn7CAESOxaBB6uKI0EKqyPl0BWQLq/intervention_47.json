I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone at the gym being creeped on by another person, and then the author responds by telling them to look at their own reflection. The gym staff then sides with the creepy guy, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author was in a situation where they felt uncomfortable and unsafe. The man was staring at her in a way that was clearly inappropriate. She tried to ignore it at first, but when he didn't stop, she confronted him. Her response was a bit direct and maybe even a bit sarcastic, but it was in response to his harassment.\n\nNow, the key issue here is whether her reaction was appropriate. Insulting someone can be a sensitive topic. If she had simply reported him to staff immediately, that's one thing. But she took a different approach by confronting him directly. Some might argue that she went too far with her words, using a sarcastic or harsh comment. Others might say that given the circumstances, her reaction was a justified self-defense against harassment.\n\nThe staff member took the creepy guy's side, which might indicate that the gym's policies prioritize avoiding conflict with members, even if they're in the wrong. But the author's actions were in response to being harassed. The second staff member later confirmed that the guy had a history of this behavior, which supports the author's claim.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were within her rights. If someone is being harassed, they have the right to stand up for themselves. However, the method used can affect the outcome. Insulting someone might escalate the situation, but in this case, it stopped the harassment. The author's intent was to stop the inappropriate behavior, not to bully. The gym staff's reaction might be more about policy than what was morally right.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's words might not be the most professional way to handle the situation, the context of harassment makes her actions understandable. The real issue is the gym not handling the harassment properly. So, I'd say the author is not in the wrong.\n"
