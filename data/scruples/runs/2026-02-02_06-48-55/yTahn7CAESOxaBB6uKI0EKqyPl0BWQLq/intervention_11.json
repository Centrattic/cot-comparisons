I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for insulting someone at the gym. The situation involves a female in her early 20s who is at the gym, and a man in his late 30s/early 40s is staring at her. She confronts him, tells him to look at the mirror instead, and then gets reprimanded by staff.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The key points here are harassment, confrontation, and the gym's response. The man was staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. Staring can be considered harassment, especially if it's unwelcome and persistent. The woman felt threatened, so she responded by confronting him with a sarcastic remark. \n\nNow, the gym staff took the man's side, which might be due to policy reasons or fear of legal issues if they take sides in a dispute. The staff's role is to maintain order and follow procedures, so they might have a rule against inappropriate interactions, which the woman violated by confronting him directly instead of reporting it.\n\nBut the woman's reaction was to defend herself from what she perceived as harassment. Her comment was a direct response to his behavior, which was making her uncomfortable. However, using a confrontational approach like that could escalate the situation and might not be in line with the gym's policies, which could prioritize non-confrontational resolution. \n\nThe other staff member later confirmed the man had a history of such behavior, which adds context. If the gym knew about his past, maybe their response was inadequate. But the question is whether the woman was at fault. \n\nLegally, in many places, harassment is a serious issue, and the onus is on the institution to address it. The woman had a right to feel safe, but her method of addressing it might have been inappropriate according to the gym's rules. However, from a moral standpoint, she was responding to harassment. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on the policies and the balance between self-advocacy and following procedures. If the gym's policy is to report such incidents to staff rather than confront the person directly, then the woman violated that policy, making her at fault. But if the gym failed to address the harassment properly, the blame isn't on her. However, since the staff reprimanded her, the gym's policy likely considers her actions as violating their rules, even if her intent was to stop harassment. \n\nTherefore, while her actions were understandable given the situation, she might be at fault according to the gym's policies and their authority to enforce rules. But morally, she's defending herself from harassment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer depends on the context of the gym's policies versus the act of self-defense. Given that the staff took the man's side and the gym's rules were emphasized, the answer would be that she's in the wrong per the gym's policies, but not necessarily morally. However, the question is likely asking for the former. So, the answer is A for Yes, she is in the wrong from the gym's perspective, but not necessarily from a moral standpoint. However, since the user is asking if she is in the wrong in the situation, considering both aspects, the answer might be B for No if we consider harassment as a justifiable reason. But given the gym's response, maybe A. Hmmm. Need to check again.\n"
