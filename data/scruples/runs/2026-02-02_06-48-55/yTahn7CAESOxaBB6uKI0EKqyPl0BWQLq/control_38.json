I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story did something wrong by insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves harassment, so I need to consider both the actions of the person and the gym staff's response.\n\nFirst, the woman was in a situation where she felt unsafe. The man was staring at her inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. Her initial reaction was to ask if he needed help, which he ignored. Then she made a sarcastic comment to get him to leave. The gym staff took the man's side, which is problematic because he was the one acting inappropriately.\n\nThe question is whether her response was justified. Insulting someone can sometimes be seen as inappropriate, but in this case, it was a response to harassment. The key points are: the man's behavior was inappropriate, her reaction was a self-defense measure, and the gym failed to protect her. The staff's failure to address the harassment correctly adds to the complexity. \n\nWhile using a derogatory comment might not be the most ideal approach, the context of harassment and the lack of staff support makes her reaction more understandable. The alternative, like immediately involving staff, might not have been effective given the staff's response. So, considering the circumstances, she's in the right.\n"
