I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a woman in her early 20s who's new to the gym and feels self-conscious. She was running on a treadmill, and a man in his late 30s/early 40s started using the one next to her but was just walking slowly. She noticed he was staring at her, not her face, which made her uncomfortable. She turned off her machine, confronted him, and when he didn't respond appropriately, she made a sarcastic comment about mirrors and his own body, which startled him into leaving.\n\nThen, a staff member approached her and accused her of bullying the man because he didn't want her to use the treadmills. She explained the situation, but the staff took the man's side. However, another staff member later confirmed that the man was known for this kind of behavior and they couldn't remove him before because he was subtle.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, first, the man's actions were clearly inappropriate\u2014he was staring at her in a sexualized way, not engaging in normal gym activity. The woman felt uncomfortable and tried to address it. Her comment was a bit harsh, but it was in response to being ignored after asking him directly. The staff's initial reaction was to side with the man, which might be due to policies about verbal interactions, but the follow-up staff member provided context that the man had a history. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the woman had the right to feel safe. The man was violating that. Her verbal response, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was a self-defense mechanism in the moment. The staff's handling of the situation might be part of the problem if they don't take harassment seriously. So, the woman isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself when faced with harassment. The key here is that the man was the one violating her space and comfort. The answer should be B (No), because she was responding to an inappropriate action, and the staff's initial judgment was possibly biased or based on incomplete info.\n"
