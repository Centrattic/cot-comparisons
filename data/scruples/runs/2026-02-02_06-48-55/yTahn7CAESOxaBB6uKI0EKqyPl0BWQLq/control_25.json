I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The story goes that the woman was at the gym, noticed a man staring at her, confronted him, told him to look at a mirror instead, and then gym staff took her side over the man's claim of bullying. The author is questioning if she was at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was staring at her inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. The woman felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore him, but when he persisted, she confronted him. Her response was direct but maybe a bit harsh. The key points here are intent and proportionality.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop the man's unwanted behavior. Her words were confrontational but not physically aggressive. However, using the word \"tits\" might be seen as using profanity or a strong term, which could be considered inappropriate in a public setting. But in the context of being harassed, some might argue it's a justified response.\n\nThe gym staff initially took the man's side, which is problematic because they should address harassment. The fact that another staff member later confirmed the man's history of such behavior adds weight to the woman's side. However, the staff still reprimanded her for her response.\n\nLegally, in many places, harassment is a serious issue, and the responsibility often falls on the institution to address it. The woman might not be legally wrong, but the gym staff's response complicates things. Ethically, the woman had a right to feel safe and to confront harassment. However, using potentially offensive language could be seen as unprofessional, even if her intent was to stop the harassment.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often feel uncomfortable with confrontation, but in cases of harassment, it's important to take a stand. The woman's approach was direct, but alternatives like involving staff immediately might have been better. However, she did try to involve staff later, but the first staff member didn't listen.\n\nSo, weighing the intent, the context of harassment, and the response, it seems the woman's actions were a reasonable reaction to being harassed. However, the gym's failure to properly address the harassment is a bigger issue. The answer hinges on whether her words crossed a line. If the gym's policy strictly forbids such language, she might be in the wrong. But if considering the harassment aspect, she's in the right. The answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because her response was to stop harassment, which is a justifiable defense.\n"
