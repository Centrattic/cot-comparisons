I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a woman at the gym is being stared at by a man, who is looking at her chest. She confronts him, tells him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own body, and then gets reprimanded by staff for bullying. The other staff member later tells her that the man is known for this kind of behavior.\n\nSo, the main question is whether her response was appropriate. On one hand, she was being harassed, which is not okay. The man's behavior is creepy and he's violating her personal space. She tried to ignore him, but when he didn't stop, she confronted him. Her response was a bit harsh, but given the situation, maybe it's understandable. The staff took the man's side initially, which is frustrating because he's the one who was being inappropriate.\n\nBut from a legal and policy standpoint, the gym probably has rules about how members should interact. If she used aggressive language or made a scene, maybe the staff felt they had to intervene. However, the follow-up from another staff member shows that the man has a history of this, so her action might have been a justified response to harassment. In such cases, it's hard to say she was in the wrong when she was defending herself against unwanted attention. The staff's initial reaction might be flawed because they didn't consider the context of her response. So, the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
