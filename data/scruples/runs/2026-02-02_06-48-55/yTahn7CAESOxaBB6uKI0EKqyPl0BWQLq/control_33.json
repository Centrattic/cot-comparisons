I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author did something wrong when she insulted a man at the gym who was staring at her. The key points here are the man's behavior and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the man was staring at her chest, which is a form of harassment. The author felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore him. When she confronted him, he wasn't trying to engage in conversation and just stared. She then told him to look at his own reflection, which led to staff taking her side initially, but later staff informed her that the man had a history of such behavior.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The man's actions were inappropriate. The author's response was direct but could be seen as rude or using a harsh retort. However, given the harassment context, she might feel justified. But did she cross the line? Insulting someone can lead to conflict, and gym policies might prioritize de-escalation. However, the staff's initial reaction might have been influenced by the man's complaint, but the second staff member validated her concern. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the author's words might have been unprofessional, they were a reaction to harassment. The man's behavior was the root issue. Since the staff later acknowledged his history, the author's response was a self-defense reaction. So, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. Legally and ethically, she has the right to address harassment, but using a confrontational method might not align with gym policies. It's a balance between self-respect and following procedures. However, since the man was a known harasser, her response was a justified reaction to a creepy situation.\n"
