I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves a woman who felt uncomfortable because a man was staring at her. She confronted him and told him to look at his own reflection. The staff took the man's side, but another staff member later confirmed the man had a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The man's behavior was inappropriate\u2014he was staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. His actions were creepy and possibly harassing. The author's response was to confront him with a sarcastic comment. While the wording might be strong, her intent was to stop the harassment.\n\nNext, the staff's reaction. The first staff member took the man's side, which is problematic because they failed to address the harassment. The second staff member confirmed the man's history, indicating the gym management was aware but hadn't acted. This suggests the system failed to protect the author.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. Legally, harassment is a serious issue. The author was defending herself against unwanted attention. Her response, while not the most polite, was a reaction to being harassed. The gym staff's lack of action might mean the author had to take some initiative, even if it wasn't perfect.\n\nHowever, the author could have perhaps reported it immediately instead of confronting him directly. But given the staff's inaction, she might not have had much faith in their support. Her reaction, though, was a way to assert herself in a hostile environment.\n\nIn terms of social norms, telling someone to stare at their own reflection is a common retort for inappropriate stares. It's a way to shut down the harassment without physical confrontation. While the language might be seen as harsh, it's a proportionate response to the harassment.\n\nSo, considering the context, the man's behavior was wrong, the staff failed to act, and the author's response was a justified self-defense against harassment. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
