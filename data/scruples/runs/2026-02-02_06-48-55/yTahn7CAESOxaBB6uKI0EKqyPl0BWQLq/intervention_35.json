I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman confronting a man at the gym who was staring at her inappropriately. The woman told him to look at his own reflection and his \"tits,\" which led to gym staff taking her side instead of the creep, even though they later admitted he's known for that behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The woman felt uncomfortable and targeted by the man's behavior. His staring was inappropriate, and the staff mentioned he's known for such actions. The woman's response was to insult him, which worked to stop his behavior but led to her being reprimanded by the gym staff because they initially took the man's side.\n\nNow, the key here is to determine if her reaction was justified. The woman was in a situation where she felt harassed. Confronting someone who's making you uncomfortable can be a personal choice. Insulting someone can be seen as aggressive, but in this case, the man's behavior was clearly inappropriate. The staff's immediate reaction to side with the man might indicate a bias or failure to address harassment properly.\n\nThe woman's statement, while perhaps not the most professional approach, was a direct response to harassment. The staff's failure to support her initially could be due to institutional issues rather than her being at fault. However, the question is about whether she is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering that the man was engaging in unwanted and harassing behavior, and her response was to stop it, it's more about self-advocacy. While using an insult might not be the best method, the intent was to protect herself from harassment. The staff's reprimand might be part of a policy that doesn't account for the harassment aspect, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the gym has strict policies against verbal altercations, even in self-defense, she might be at fault from a policy standpoint. But the broader context of harassment needs to be considered. The staff later admitted the man was a known creep, which shifts the perspective that the woman was justified in her reaction. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the woman's reaction was a reasonable response to harassment. Given that, I think she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
