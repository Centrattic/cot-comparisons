I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation is that the guy was staring at her, and she told him to look at his own reflection. Then the gym staff took the guy's side, which confused her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman was in a vulnerable situation, feeling uncomfortable because the man was staring inappropriately. She tried to ignore him first, then confronted him when he didn't stop. Her response was direct but maybe confrontational. The staff's reaction was to side with the man, which raises questions about how the gym handles such situations. The man's history of inappropriate behavior, as mentioned by another staff member, adds context that he might be the one at fault.\n\nThe key points here are: 1. The man's behavior was inappropriate, 2. The woman felt threatened and tried to defend herself, 3. The gym staff didn't adequately protect her.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. From a moral standpoint, the woman was being harassed, and her reaction, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was a response to being made uncomfortable. However, staff might view the confrontation as aggressive. But considering the man's history, the real fault lies with him. The author's actions were self-defense in a hostile environment. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a bit nuanced. The staff's handling of the situation is also problematic. The woman's response was justified given the circumstances, even if the gym didn't handle it well.\n"
