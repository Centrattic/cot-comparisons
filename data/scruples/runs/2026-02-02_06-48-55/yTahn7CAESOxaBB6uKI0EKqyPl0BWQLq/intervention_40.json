I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman at the gym who was being stared at by a creepy guy, and she responded by insulting him. Then, the gym staff took her aside and told her to stop, but later found out that the guy was a known harasser.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The woman felt harassed and acted in self-defense, which is understandable. She was uncomfortable and the guy was clearly making her feel unsafe. Her response was direct but perhaps a bit harsh. The gym staff initially took the man's side, which is a problem because they didn't support her. However, the staff later confirmed the man had a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the woman was in the wrong for her response. She was reacting to harassment, which is a serious issue. However, her method of addressing it was confrontational. Insulting someone in that way might be considered inappropriate in a public setting, even if it's a response to harassment. But given the context, her actions were a form of self-advocacy. The gym's initial reaction of taking the harasser's side is concerning, but the woman's response was a reaction to being made to feel unsafe.\n\nOn the other hand, she could have approached a staff member immediately instead of confronting him directly. But she might not have known the man was a known harasser at the time, so her immediate reaction was based on her own experience. The staff later admitted the man's behavior, so the woman's response was actually valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the woman was defending herself against harassment. While her method might be seen as confrontational, the situation justified her actions. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
