I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman at the gym who felt uncomfortable because a man was staring at her. She confronted him by telling him to look at his own reflection, and then staff sided with him, leading to her leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both perspectives. The woman was in a public space, maybe feeling harassed. She tried to ignore him, then asked him what he wanted, and when he didn't stop, she made a sarcastic comment. The man reported her for bullying. The staff took his side, but another staff member later confirmed the man had a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the appropriateness of her response. The man was making her uncomfortable by staring, which is a form of harassment. Her response was direct and maybe a bit confrontational, but it was in self-defense, right? She was protecting herself from an uncomfortable situation. However, using a sarcastic or confrontational remark might not be the best approach in a public setting where interactions are supposed to be respectful. The staff might see it as a conflict between members, and she could be liable for using harsh language.\n\nBut wait, the man's behavior was inappropriate first. He was staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. The staff's initial response was to side with him, which is problematic because he was the one acting inappropriately. The second staff member confirmed that the man had a history, so maybe the first staff didn't handle it correctly.\n\nSo, was the woman in the wrong? She was defending herself against someone's unwanted attention. However, her method of confronting him might be seen as aggressive or unprofessional. In some contexts, using such language might escalate the situation. But considering the harassment aspect, her reaction was a form of self-advocacy. The staff's handling of the situation seems biased, which adds to the complexity.\n\nThe question is about whether she's at fault. If the man was indeed harassing her, then her response is understandable. But if the staff's job is to mediate conflicts and ensure a safe environment, then the staff's failure to address the harassment properly is part of the issue. The woman's comment was a direct response to being stared at, which is a personal boundary being crossed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong because she was responding to harassment. But the staff's reaction could be part of the problem. The key here is whether her response was proportionate. Insulting someone might not be the best approach, but given the context, it was a way to assert herself. So, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
