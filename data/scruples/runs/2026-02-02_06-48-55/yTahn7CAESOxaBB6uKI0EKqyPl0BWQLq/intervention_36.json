I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a woman at the gym is being stared at by a man who's walking slowly on a treadmill nearby. She confronts him when it becomes uncomfortable, tells him to look at the mirror instead, and he leaves. Then gym staff side with the man, saying she can't talk to people like that. Another staff member later confirms the man is known for such behavior.\n\nFirst, the man's actions are clearly inappropriate. Staring at someone's body without consent is creepy and makes the woman uncomfortable. The woman tried to ignore him at first, which is understandable, but when he didn't stop, he escalated the situation. She confronts him, which is a reasonable response when someone is making her uncomfortable. Her response, while direct, seems justified given the context. \n\nNow, the staff member says she can't talk to people like that. But the problem here is that the staff didn't consider the context. If the man was being harassing, then the woman's response is a justified defense. The staff taking the man's side without hearing both sides is a flaw in their handling. Also, the second staff member confirms that the man is known for such behavior, which suggests the gym has prior knowledge but hasn't addressed it properly. \n\nThe key point is whether the woman's response was necessary and appropriate. She was in a potentially unsafe situation, being stared at by someone who's known for inappropriate behavior. Telling him to look at the mirror is a verbal response that didn't escalate to physical confrontation. It's possible that she could have called a staff member immediately, but given that the gym staff didn't act when she did, maybe she had to take matters into her own hands. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she shouldn't have responded with a comment about his body, even if he was being creepy. But given the context, her comment was a direct and humorous way to put him in his place, and it worked. The fact that the man left suggests that her words were effective. \n\nThe staff's failure to address the man's prior behavior and their immediate judgment of the woman as the aggressor is a bigger issue. However, the question is about whether the woman is in the wrong. Her actions were a response to harassment, so she's defending herself. Even though the gym staff didn't handle it correctly, that doesn't make her wrong. She wasn't the initial aggressor, and her response was a reaction to being harassed. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the woman is not in the wrong. The man's behavior was the problem, and her response was justified given the circumstances. The staff's failure to support her is on them, not her.\n"
