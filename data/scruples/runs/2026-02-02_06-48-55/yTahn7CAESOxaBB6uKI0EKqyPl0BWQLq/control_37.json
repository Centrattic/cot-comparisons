I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The scenario involves a woman who confronts a man she feels is staring at her inappropriately. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman is at the gym, self-conscious, and encounters a man who's being inappropriately attentive. She confronts him by making a sarcastic comment, which leads to staff taking her side against her. The key points are the man's behavior, her response, and the gym's handling of the situation.\n\nThe man was described as a \"creep\" and known for inappropriate behavior. The woman felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore him before confronting him. Her response, while direct, was a retort to his staring. The staff took his side, which complicates things because it seems the gym didn't support her.\n\nLegally, verbal threats or insults can sometimes be an issue, but in this case, the woman was defending herself against harassment. However, her method of confrontation was confrontational and could be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate in a public setting. The gym staff's response suggests they had policies against such interactions, even if the other person was at fault.\n\nEthically, she had the right to feel safe and to address the harassment. But the way she addressed it might not align with the gym's rules. The staff's reaction indicates that the gym prioritizes maintaining order and might not want patrons to handle conflicts themselves, especially with potentially volatile situations.\n\nThe woman's justification for her action is valid because she was dealing with harassment. However, the gym's policy might require reporting issues to staff rather than confronting individuals directly. So, while her intent was to handle harassment, her method might have violated gym rules, leading to her being in the wrong according to the establishment's policies.\n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the woman's actions were wrong under the gym's rules versus the man's inappropriate behavior. Since the question is about whether she's in the wrong, and the staff took his side based on their policies, it's possible that the woman's method of confrontation was not the appropriate way to handle the situation according to the gym's guidelines, even if her intent was justified.\n"
