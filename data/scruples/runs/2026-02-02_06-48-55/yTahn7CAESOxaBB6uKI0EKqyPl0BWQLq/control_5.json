I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe woman was at the gym, on a treadmill, and a man started staring at her. She turned off her treadmill and asked him what he wanted. When he didn't respond appropriately, she told him to go look at his own reflection. Then a staff member came and told her to stop because the man claimed she bullied him. Another staff member later confirmed the man was known for inappropriate behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are harassment and the response. The man was staring at her inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. She responded by confronting him, which might be seen as self-defense. However, her response was to call him out in a way that might not be the most professional or appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, she was defending herself from unwanted attention. On the other, using the phrase \"go stare at your own tits\" could be considered rude or aggressive. The gym staff took the other person's side, perhaps because they can't take sides in conflicts without more evidence, or maybe they have policies against harassment but also against disruptive behavior.\n\nBut considering that the man had a history of this kind of behavior, her reaction might be justified. The staff later confirmed he had a pattern, so maybe she did the right thing by confronting him. However, escalating the situation with a harsh comment might not be the best approach. It's possible that she could have reported him immediately instead of confronting him directly.\n\nBut given the context, she felt uncomfortable and tried to handle it on the spot. The gym's response was confusing because they took his complaint more seriously, which might indicate a failure on their part to address harassment properly. But the question is about her. The staff member told her to stop, so maybe they felt her words were inappropriate, even if the other person's behavior was worse. However, the second staff member's input suggests that the man had a history, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. Legally, she might not be at fault if the man was indeed harassing her. But gym policies might have rules about how members interact. If she used a derogatory comment, that could be against the rules regardless of the reason. However, the main issue was the man's harassment. The answer might depend on whether her response was proportionate. Insulting someone, even if they're a creep, might not be the best approach, but it's understandable in the moment. \n\nSo, the options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no). Considering the circumstances, the answer is likely B because the man was harassing her and she was defending herself. But the method of confrontation might be questionable. However, given the context, her reaction is justified as a response to harassment. The gym staff's handling of the situation also seems flawed. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
