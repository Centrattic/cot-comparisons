I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a woman at the gym gets creeped out by a man staring at her, and she responds by telling him to look at his own reflection. The gym staff then sides with the man, saying she shouldn't have spoken to him that way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was staring at her inappropriately, which made her uncomfortable. The woman's reaction was direct and confrontational. While her intention was self-defense, the way she responded might have been unprofessional or disrespectful, even if the man was in the wrong. \n\nBut then, the staff didn't believe her explanation and took the man's side. This raises questions about whether there's a systemic issue in how the gym handles complaints. However, the user is asking if the woman is in the wrong for her actions. \n\nIn terms of social norms, responding with a sarcastic or harsh comment might not be the best approach, but it's understandable given the situation. However, the staff's reaction suggests that verbal confrontation, even if justified, might not be the appropriate method in a public setting. Maybe she should have reported the behavior immediately instead of confronting him directly. \n\nBut is she at fault? The man was the one violating her personal space. Her response was a way to assert herself. However, the line between self-defense and bullying can be blurry. If the staff's policy is strict, maybe her response was inappropriate. But given the man's behavior, her reaction might be seen as justified. \n\nI think the key here is whether her actions crossed into bullying. The staff believed the man's claim over hers, which is problematic, but that doesn't necessarily mean she was wrong. Alternatively, maybe she could have handled it differently. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best course of action. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the woman was responding to harassment. Her reaction, while perhaps unorthodox, was a way to protect herself. The man's behavior was the root of the problem. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
