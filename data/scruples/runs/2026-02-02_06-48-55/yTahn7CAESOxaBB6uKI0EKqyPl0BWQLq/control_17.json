I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The story is that a woman was at the gym, noticed a man staring at her, confronted him, told him to look at his own reflection, and then was reprimanded by staff who took his side. The other staff later confirmed the man was known for being creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman felt uncomfortable because the man was staring at her. She confronted him, which is a reasonable response to harassment. Her comment, while direct and maybe a bit harsh, was in response to his inappropriate behavior. The staff initially took his side, which might be because they didn't witness the behavior and only heard his side. However, another staff member later confirmed the man had a history of such behavior. \n\nThe key here is whether her response was justified. The man was being a creep, and her reaction was to tell him to look at his own reflection. While that might be seen as using a derogatory term, it's a direct response to his harassment. The staff's initial reaction is problematic because they didn't take her side, but the second staff member did. The woman's actions were in self-defense against harassment. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the woman was defending herself against someone who was making her uncomfortable. The staff's failure to address the man's behavior properly is an issue, but the woman isn't at fault for standing up for herself. The question is whether she was in the wrong. Considering that the man was the aggressor and her response was to stop the harassment, the answer is likely B (No). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, maybe she should have reported him first, but given the context, her immediate reaction was understandable. Also, the staff's initial response was flawed, but that doesn't make her wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
