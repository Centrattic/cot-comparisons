I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting the creep at the gym. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe woman is at the treadmill, the gym is empty. A man comes over, walks slowly, stares at her. She turns off her treadmill and asks him what he wants. He grunts and keeps staring. She gets annoyed and tells him to look at his own reflection. He leaves. Then, staff approaches her, says she's bullying him for not allowing him to use the treadmill. She finds out later that the staff member knew the guy was a creep.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and harassment. The man was being inappropriate by staring, which is a form of harassment. The woman felt uncomfortable and responded with a retort. The staff took his side, which seems unjust because he was the one violating boundaries. \n\nThe question is whether she is at fault. If someone is being harassed, they have the right to defend themselves, even if the method might not be the official policy. The woman's response was direct and confrontational, which can be seen as a way to stop the harassment immediately. However, she did not use formal channels first, which the staff might have expected. But given that the staff didn't address the man's behavior earlier, her actions could be justified as self-defense against harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she should have reported it instead of confronting him. But considering the man's history and the staff's inability to act before, maybe her direct approach was the only effective one. Also, harassment laws usually prioritize the victim's right to protect themselves. \n\nSo, in terms of ethics, the man was wrong, she was protecting herself. The staff's response seems flawed. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
