I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. First, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe woman is at a mostly empty gym, running on a treadmill. A man comes over, walks very slowly on the adjacent treadmill, and stares at her chest. She turns off her treadmill to confront him, and he just grunts. She tells him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body. The staff then sides with him, saying she bullied him, but another staff member later confirms he's known for inappropriate behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here: the man was being creepy and making her uncomfortable. She responded verbally, which he took as bullying. The gym staff took his side initially but later admitted he's a known issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, there's a line between self-defense in words and harassment. But this is more about social and ethical judgment. She was responding to harassment. Retaliation in words might be seen as justified given the context. However, the gym's policy might require reporting to staff rather than direct confrontation. \n\nBut the staff's initial reaction was to side with the man, which is problematic. The second staff member's confirmation that he's known for this behavior supports her claim. So, she was defending herself against harassment. Her response was direct but perhaps could have been handled differently. However, considering the situation, many would agree she had the right to stand up for herself. The gym's staff response is also questionable, but the main issue is her actions. She's not in the wrong for defending herself.\n"
