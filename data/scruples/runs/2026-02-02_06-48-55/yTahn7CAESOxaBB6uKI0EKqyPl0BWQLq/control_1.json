I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a woman at the gym was being stared at inappropriately by a man. She confronted him, told him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body, which made him leave. Then, when the staff took her side, she left. But one staff member said the guy was known for this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The man was staring at her in a creepy way, which she found uncomfortable. She asked him what he wanted, and when he didn't respond appropriately, she made a sarcastic comment. She didn't physically confront him or use threats, just a verbal response. \n\nThe staff member took the man's side initially, but another staff member confirmed that the man had a history of such behavior. The gym staff might have been trying to handle it by not escalating, but the woman was clearly harassed. \n\nNow, the key points: Was her response appropriate? Insulting someone, even if they're being creepy, could be seen as using verbal aggression. However, the context is harassment. She was trying to defend herself from unwanted attention. The gym staff's reaction might be based on policy, which might prioritize de-escalation over allowing personal confrontations. \n\nBut the problem is that the man was harassing her, and her response was a direct but non-violent way to stop it. The staff's initial response was to take the harasser's side, which is concerning. However, the question is whether she was in the wrong. Legally, if someone is harassing another person, the victim can take reasonable steps to stop it. Her response might be seen as within her right to self-defense in a way, even if it's an insult. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she should have gone to staff first instead of confronting him directly. But she might not have felt safe to do so at the moment. The staff member later admitted the man was a known issue, so maybe the staff didn't handle it properly. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some might say she should have used a less aggressive approach. Others would support her standing up for herself. \n\nSo, considering all that, the woman was being harassed, and her response was a way to stop it. The staff's initial reaction was flawed, but the question is about her actions. Since she was defending herself against harassment, her actions were justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
