I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a woman at the gym who feels uncomfortable because a man is staring at her inappropriately. She confronts him by telling him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body, which makes him leave. Then, a staff member reprimands her for bullying the man, but another staff member later confirms that the man has a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was staring at her, which is a form of harassment. The woman's response was direct but used a sarcastic or mocking comment. She might have felt threatened or uncomfortable, which is a valid reaction. However, using a confrontational approach, even if justified, might be seen as aggressive in some settings, depending on gym policies. \n\nThe gym staff took the man's side initially, which is problematic because the man's behavior was inappropriate. The fact that another staff member later supports her by confirming the man's history suggests that the first staff's response was flawed. \n\nThe key points here are the man's harassment and the woman's defensive reaction. Legally and ethically, the man's behavior is wrong. The woman's response, while perhaps not the most professional method, was a reaction to being harassed. However, in terms of gym rules, if the staff's policy is strict against aggressive language, even if justified, she might be technically in the wrong according to their rules. But morally, her reaction is understandable given the harassment. The answer depends on whether we judge by the gym's policies or the ethical context of harassment. Since the question is about whether she's \"in the wrong,\" considering both aspects, the answer might be more nuanced. However, the staff's initial judgment was influenced by the man's false accusation, which complicates things. Ultimately, the harassment is the man's fault, but her response could be seen as justified given the circumstances, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
