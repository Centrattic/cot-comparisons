I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the woman is at the gym, which is a public space. She's on a treadmill, and the gym is empty. A man starts using the treadmill next to her but isn't really exercising. He's staring at her, specifically at her chest, not looking at her face. She confronts him by turning off her treadmill and asking what he wants. When he doesn't respond appropriately, she tells him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body. He leaves, but then a staff member approaches, saying the man claimed she bullied him. The staff took his side, but another staff member later confirmed that the man is known for inappropriate behavior.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the man's behavior was inappropriate\u2014staring in a way that made her uncomfortable. She tried to confront him directly, which is a personal response. She used a sarcastic retort, which might be seen as aggressive or inappropriate in a public setting. The staff didn't believe her side, possibly due to the man's accusation and the initial staff's bias.\n\nLegally, in many places, harassment is a concern. The man's behavior is harassing. However, the woman's response was verbal and not physical. The issue is whether her reaction was justified. Public places require a certain decorum; while the man was wrong, her response might be seen as escalating the situation or not the best approach. However, she was in a vulnerable situation and responding to harassment. The staff's handling is also a problem if they prioritize the man's claim over hers without evidence.\n\nIn terms of ethics, she was defending herself from harassment. But her method could be questioned. Maybe she should have reported it immediately. However, she did try to handle it first, which is common in such situations. The staff's failure to address the man's known behavior is part of the problem too.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because she was reacting to harassment. The man's actions were the initial wrongdoing. However, her response might not have been the best approach. But given the context, her reaction is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
