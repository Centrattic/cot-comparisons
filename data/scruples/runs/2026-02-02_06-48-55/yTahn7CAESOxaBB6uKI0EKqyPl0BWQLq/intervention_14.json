I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman at the gym who confronts a man who's staring at her. The key points are the man's behavior, her response, and the gym staff's reaction.\n\nFirst, the man was staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable. He was on the treadmill next to hers, moving very slowly, and not engaging in real exercise. She turned off her treadmill to ask him what he wanted, but he just grunted and kept staring. That's pretty clear harassment, right? Creepy behavior like that isn't okay, and she had every right to feel unsafe.\n\nHer response was to tell him to look in the mirror and stare at his own. That's a bit confrontational, but given the situation, it's a direct way to call out his behavior without physical confrontation. She's in a public space, and he was violating her personal space. She didn't escalate it with violence or aggression, just verbal. \n\nNow, the staff took his side. The first employee didn't believe her explanation and just told her not to talk that way. The second staff member confirmed that the man was known for such behavior. So the gym's initial response was flawed\u2014they should have believed her and addressed the harassment. The problem here seems to be the staff's failure to support the victim, not the woman's response.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is unsure. The question is whether her verbal response was inappropriate. Considering the context of harassment, her reaction was a valid attempt to defend herself. She didn't cause harm, just stood up for herself. The real issue is the man's actions and the gym's inadequate response. So, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
