I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The author is a woman in her early 20s who's self-conscious but trying to get more active. She was on a treadmill, and a man in his late 30s or early 40s started using the treadmill next to hers, but he was walking so slowly it wasn't really exercising. Then, she noticed he was staring at her breasts, not her face. She turned off her treadmill, confronted him, and he just grunted and shook his head. She then told him to go stare at his own in the mirror, which shocked him and made him leave. Later, a staff member told her to stop what she was doing because the guy claimed she bullied him. But another staff member said he's known for that behavior.\n\nSo, the main question is whether her response was justified. The gym was empty, so maybe she felt unsafe. Insulting someone directly might be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate, even if the guy was being creepy. But on the other hand, she was the victim of unwanted attention. The staff took his side initially, which is concerning. The second staff member's info suggests the guy has a history. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, verbal confrontation can be a line. While his behavior was wrong, her response might be considered aggressive or disrespectful, depending on the gym's policies. However, she had a right to feel harassed and to set boundaries. The staff's reaction might be because they need to avoid conflicts without evidence. Maybe she should have involved staff immediately, but given the staff's lack of awareness about the guy's history, she might not have had a choice. \n\nSo, likely the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. Her reaction was a self-defense measure against harassment. The gym staff's handling was poor, as they should have addressed the harassment. Insults can be a form of asserting oneself when other options aren't available. While the approach was direct, the context of harassment makes it understandable. The key is that the man was being inappropriate, and she had a right to respond to protect herself.\n"
