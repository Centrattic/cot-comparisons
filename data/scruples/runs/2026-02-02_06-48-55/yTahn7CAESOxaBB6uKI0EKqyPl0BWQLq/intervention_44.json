I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a woman in her early 20s at the gym, dealing with a creepy older guy who's staring at her. She tries to ignore him but eventually confronts him by saying something about mirrors and his own body. Then a staff member tells her to stop, taking the man's side, but another staff member later confirms he's known for this behavior.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thought she might be, but the situation seems pretty clear. The man was harassing her, and she responded in self-defense. However, the staff's reaction complicates it. Maybe they were following a policy against confrontational behavior, even if the situation was harassment. But the second staff's confirmation suggests the man's behavior was indeed inappropriate.\n\nSo, she confronted someone who was making her uncomfortable, and while her method might have been direct, it was in response to harassment. The staff might have overreacted, prioritizing rules over the harassment. The user's actions were a reaction to being stared at inappropriately. Even if she could have gone to staff first, the immediate response seems justified given the context. The staff's failure to address the man's known behavior is more to blame. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
