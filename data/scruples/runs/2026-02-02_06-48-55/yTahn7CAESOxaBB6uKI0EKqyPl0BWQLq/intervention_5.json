I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. I need to determine if the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a woman in her early 20s at the gym. A man in his late 30s/early 40s is on a treadmill next to her, staring at her breasts. She confronts him, he doesn't respond, so she insults him, telling him to look in the mirror. The staff sides with him, and later another staff member says he's known for this behavior.\n\nSo, key points to consider: \n\n1. **Harassment vs. Insult**: The man was staring in a way that made her uncomfortable. That's harassment. She responded with a verbal retort. Is that retaliation justified?\n\n2. **Staff Response**: The staff didn't support her, maybe because they took the man's side or didn't believe her. But another staff member later confirms he's known for it. So perhaps the initial staff was ineffective.\n\n3. **Appropriate Response**: Was her reaction appropriate? She was in a public space, and the man was violating her personal space. Confronting him directly might be a natural reaction. But using a rude comment could be seen as escalating the situation.\n\n4. **Legal and Ethical Standpoints**: In many places, harassment is a serious issue. The man's behavior is wrong, but the author's response might be seen as self-defense in terms of asserting her space. However, using a derogatory comment could be problematic if it's aggressive rather than a calm report.\n\n5. **Alternative Actions**: She could have asked a staff member first, but if she felt immediate discomfort, confronting might be necessary. The staff's failure to act properly is problematic, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to react.\n\n6. **Context of Power and Safety**: As a woman confronting an older man, her reaction might stem from feeling unsafe. The man's behavior was creepy and unwelcome. Her response, while not the most professional, could be seen as defending herself against harassment.\n\n7. **Social Norms**: Society often encourages people to speak up against harassment. However, the method can vary. Insulting someone might not be the best approach, but in the moment, it's a common reaction. The staff's bias might reflect systemic issues rather than the author's fault.\n\nConsidering all these, the author was reacting to harassment. While her response might not be the most diplomatic, it was a reaction to being made uncomfortable. The staff's failure to support her correctly points to a problem in their handling, not necessarily the author's actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
