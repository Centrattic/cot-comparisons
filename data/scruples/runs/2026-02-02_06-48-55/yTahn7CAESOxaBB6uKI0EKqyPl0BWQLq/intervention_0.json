I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for insulting a man at the gym who was staring at her. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman was at the gym, feeling self-conscious. Another man started walking on the treadmill next to her, moving very slowly and staring at her breasts. After she confronts him, he doesn't respond appropriately, so she tells him to look at his own reflection. Then, gym staff side with him, and later another staff member reveals he has a history of such behavior.\n\nNow, breaking down the key points. The woman was in her own space, and the man was objectifying her by staring at her body. Confrontation happened when she asked him what he wanted, but he didn't stop. Her response was a direct and sarcastic comment, which made him leave. However, gym staff took her comment as bullying and didn't support her side initially.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but is that accurate? Well, from a legal standpoint, unless there's a specific rule against verbal confrontation, it's hard to say she broke any laws. But gyms often have policies about respectful behavior. However, the man was violating her personal space and making her uncomfortable, which is a form of harassment.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often feel it's justified to defend themselves from harassment, even if their method isn't the most diplomatic. The woman was in a vulnerable situation, and her reaction was a way to reclaim her space. The gym staff's failure to address the man's behavior properly is a problem. But the key question is whether her response was appropriate.\n\nThe author's actions were direct and possibly confrontational, which could be seen as rude. However, given the context of harassment, many would argue that her reaction was a reasonable defense. The gym's response in taking the man's side is concerning, but the staff's decision to side with him might reflect a failure to handle harassment reports effectively.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the man's behavior was inappropriate, the woman's response was a way to stop the harassment, and the gym's handling was inadequate. The author's actions, while maybe not the most tactful, were in self-defense against harassment. Therefore, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
