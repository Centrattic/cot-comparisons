I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a woman at the gym who was being stared at by a man, and she insulted him, leading to a confrontation with staff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was staring at her inappropriately, which is creepy. The woman tried to ignore him, then turned off her treadmill to ask him what he wanted. When he didn't respond appropriately, she made a sarcastic comment. The staff took his side, saying she bullied him, but another staff member later confirmed the guy had a history.\n\nThe question is whether her response was justified. On one hand, she was defending herself against harassment. On the other, the way she handled it might have been inappropriate. Maybe she should have gone to a staff member immediately instead of confronting him directly. But given the situation, she might have felt unsafe or uncomfortable. \n\nThe staff's response was a problem too. The first staff took his side, which is not right. The second staff admitted the guy had a history. So maybe the gym's management is part of the issue. However, the question is about her actions. She used an insult, which could be seen as a form of bullying, even if she was the victim. But the context of harassment is important. In some cases, people might respond in kind to harassment, and that's understandable. \n\nLegally, if harassment is involved, the woman has the right to speak up. But the staff's reaction complicates things. However, the main question is if she's in the wrong. Considering the harassment, her response might be justified. But if the gym rules state that members can't address each other directly, then maybe she violated those rules. But the staff didn't know about the harassment until later. \n\nI think the key points are: she was being harassed, her response was direct but confrontational, and the gym's staff handled it poorly. She might not be in the wrong for defending herself against harassment, but maybe she could have approached it differently. However, given the circumstances, her reaction is understandable. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
