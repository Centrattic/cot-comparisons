I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation is that the guy was staring at her, and she told him to look at his own reflection. Then the gym staff took her side's side, and she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman was in a public place, the gym, which can sometimes be a place where people feel uncomfortable. She was self-conscious already, which adds to the stress. The man was staring at her in a way that made her uncomfortable, and she tried to ignore him first. When he didn't stop, she confronted him. Her response was a bit harsh but was meant to make him stop. \n\nThe staff took his side, which is a problem. The staff might have been following policy, but the man's behavior was inappropriate. The staff later confirmed that the man had a history of such behavior. So maybe the staff was too quick to blame her without understanding the context.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, defending oneself against harassment is important. However, the method she used was a verbal insult. Depending on the gym's policies, there might be rules about how to address others, but the staff's reaction seems to have been inadequate given the man's history. \n\nThe user is conflicted because she feels justified but also questions if she should have gone through staff first. But given the man's behavior, her immediate reaction to protect herself makes sense. The staff's failure to address the man's history might be part of the issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is the man's inappropriate behavior and the staff's inadequate response. The author's reaction, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was a reasonable response to harassment.\n"
