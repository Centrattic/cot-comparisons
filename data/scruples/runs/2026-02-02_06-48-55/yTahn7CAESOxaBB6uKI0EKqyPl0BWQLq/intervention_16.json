I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation is that the guy was staring at her, she confronted him, told him to look at his own reflection, and then a staff member reprimanded her for bullying him. Another staff member later confirmed the guy had a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was uncomfortable with the man's behavior. Confronting someone in this situation can be tricky. The author's response was direct and sarcastic, telling him to look at his own reflection. The staff initially took the man's side, but it's revealed he has a history of such behavior. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, responding with a comment about his own appearance could be seen as a form of verbal confrontation. In some contexts, that might escalate the situation. On the other hand, the man's behavior was inappropriate and harassing. The author felt threatened and acted to protect herself. \n\nBut the staff's reaction suggests that the gym's policy might prioritize addressing complaints from members without allowing the other party to retaliate. However, in this case, the second staff member confirmed the man's history, which indicates the gym was aware but hadn't taken action. The author's response might be justified as self-defense against harassment. \n\nHowever, the method of response could be debated. Using a sarcastic or confrontational approach might not align with the gym's policies for handling disputes. The staff might prefer that customers report such incidents to staff rather than handle it themselves. \n\nSo, the author's intent was to stop harassment, which is valid. The method could have been more aligned with the gym's procedures, but the situation was uncomfortable and the man's actions were clearly wrong. The second staff member's validation supports the author's perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, while the approach might not have followed gym protocols, the author's intent was to address harassment, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
