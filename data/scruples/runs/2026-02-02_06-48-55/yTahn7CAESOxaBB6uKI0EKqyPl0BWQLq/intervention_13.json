I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation involves a female in her early 20s who was staring at by a man in his late 30s/early 40s. She confronted him with an insult, which led to staff siding with the man. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now asking for an opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man was staring at her inappropriately, and she felt uncomfortable. Confronting someone who's making you uncomfortable is a natural reaction. However, the method she used was an insult, which could be seen as aggressive. But given the man's behavior, it's a form of self-defense. The staff's response is also a point\u2014maybe they handled it poorly by not addressing the harassment.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The man was engaging in inappropriate behavior (staring at her body, not her face).\n2. The author confronted him directly when he wasn't responsive to her initial question.\n3. The gym staff took the man's side, even after being informed of the harassment.\n\nThe question is whether the insult was justified. In many cases, people in such situations might feel they have no other choice but to confront the harasser, especially if they're in a public place where staff might not act immediately. The man's subtle harassment (staring, avoiding others) might make it hard to prove, so the staff might not take it seriously unless there's a direct complaint.\n\nHowever, the author's response was verbal and potentially confrontational. While it's understandable given the circumstances, some might argue that using a derogatory term could escalate the situation. But considering the harassment and the lack of staff support, her reaction was a form of self-advocacy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the line is blurry. The man's actions were clearly inappropriate, and the author was defending herself. The staff's failure to address the man's behavior properly is a bigger issue here. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the most professional, was a response to harassment. So, the answer would lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
