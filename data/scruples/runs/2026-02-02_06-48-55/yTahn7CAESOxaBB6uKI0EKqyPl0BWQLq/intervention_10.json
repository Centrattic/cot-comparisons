I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a woman in her early 20s at the gym, dealing with a situation where a man is staring at her inappropriately. She confronts him, tells him to look at the mirror instead, and then staff approach her about bullying. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the guy was staring at her breasts, which is harassment. She felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore it first. When he didn't stop, she asked what he wanted, but he continued. Then she made a sarcastic comment. Her reaction seems to be a response to his harassment. She's trying to protect herself in a situation where she's already feeling self-conscious and targeted.\n\nStaff took his side, which is concerning. Maybe the staff didn't believe her account because of how she reacted, but the man had a history. The other staff mentioned he's known for this, so she wasn't making it up. She might have dealt with it differently by involving staff earlier, but her immediate response was to confront him because she felt unsafe. \n\nHer words were direct and confrontational, but given the context of harassment, her reaction is understandable. She was trying to assert herself in a hostile situation. The staff's response seems to have been biased towards the man, which is a problem. \n\nIs she in the wrong? She was defending herself against harassment. While her approach might not have been the most constructive, the main issue is the man's behavior. The staff failing to handle it properly is part of the problem. So, in terms of right and wrong, she's not in the wrong. The man's actions were inappropriate, and she had a right to feel unsafe and react. The answer should be B.\n"
