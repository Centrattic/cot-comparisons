I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman at the gym who's dealing with a creepy guy who's staring at her. She insults him, telling him to look at his own reflection, and then gets reprimanded by staff for bullying.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both parties. The woman was in a situation where she felt uncomfortable due to the man's behavior. The man was staring at her inappropriately, which is definitely not acceptable. The woman's response was to confront him with a sarcastic comment. While her response might be seen as rude or unprofessional, it's important to consider the context of harassment.\n\nThe staff took the man's side, which is a problem because the man's behavior was likely the real issue. However, the staff's job is to enforce rules, even if they might not fully understand the harassment. The woman's intent was to stop the harassment, which is a valid reason for taking action. But the method she used\u2014insulting him\u2014could be seen as a form of bullying, even if it was a reaction to being harassed.\n\nOn the other hand, the man's behavior is the root issue here. If the staff knew he was a known harasser, that's a separate problem with the gym's policies. The woman might not be at fault entirely, but she could have handled it differently by reporting him immediately instead of confronting him directly. However, in the moment, her reaction might be justified given the stress and discomfort she was experiencing.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the woman's action was a response to harassment, but using verbal aggression might not have been the best approach. However, considering the harassment, it's hard to fully blame her. The staff's response was inadequate, but that doesn't necessarily mean the woman was wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards her not being in the wrong because the initial harassment was the main issue.\n"
