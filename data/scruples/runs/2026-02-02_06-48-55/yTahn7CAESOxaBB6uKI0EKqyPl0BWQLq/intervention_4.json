I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation is that a woman was at the gym, noticed a guy staring at her, confronted him, and told him to look in the mirror. The gym staff took the guy's side, saying she shouldn't speak to people like that. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but the question is to determine if she actually is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy was staring at her inappropriately, which is harassing behavior. The woman was uncomfortable and tried to ignore him, then confronted him. Her response was a bit harsh, but it was in reaction to being harassed. However, she did use a derogatory comment, which could be seen as aggressive. The staff's response might be based on gym policies that prohibit verbal confrontations, even if the confrontation was about harassment.\n\nBut wait, harassment is a serious issue. The woman was defending herself against someone's inappropriate behavior. Is there a point where self-defense or confrontation is acceptable? Gym policies might have rules against public confrontations to maintain order, but the staff's response here seems off because they didn't address the harassment. The author might not be in the wrong because she was responding to harassment, but maybe her approach was unwise. However, the alternative\u2014reporting immediately\u2014might have been better. The staff later admitted the guy was known for this, so her reaction, while not the best, was understandable given the situation.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the woman's actions were a reaction to harassment. While her wording was harsh, she was defending herself. The gym staff's failure to address the harassment properly is a problem. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she was responding to a creepy situation, but maybe there's room for a more appropriate way to handle it. However, given the circumstances, her reaction is justified. So the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
