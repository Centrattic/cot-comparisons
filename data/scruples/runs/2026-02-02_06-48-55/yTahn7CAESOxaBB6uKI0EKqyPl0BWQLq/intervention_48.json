I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The situation is that a woman was on a treadmill, and a man nearby was staring at her. When she confronted him, he didn't stop, so she told him to go look at his own body in the mirror. The gym staff took the man's side, suggesting she shouldn't have spoken to him that way. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The man was staring inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. The woman felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore him, but when he didn't respond to her direct question, she escalated her response. The key points here are her right to feel safe and the appropriateness of her response.\n\nThe staff's reaction is important. They took the man's side, which might indicate that their policy is to avoid confrontations or that they prioritize certain behaviors. However, the staff later admitted the man had a history of inappropriate behavior. So, there's a conflict between the gym's handling of the situation and the woman's self-defense.\n\nNow, the question is whether her response was justified. Insulting someone can be a form of verbal harassment, but in this context, she was responding to his harassment. The line between self-defense and retaliation can be blurry. If she had approached a staff member first, that might have been more appropriate. However, considering the man's behavior and her discomfort, her reaction might be seen as a justified attempt to protect herself.\n\nThe user thinks she's wrong, but others might argue that she had a right to stand up for herself in the moment. The staff's failure to address the man's history properly could also have influenced her decision. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because her response was to a harassing situation, and while her method was confrontational, it was in self-defense. However, there's a nuance in that she could have used a different approach. But given the context, it's more about being in her right to feel unsafe and respond.\n"
