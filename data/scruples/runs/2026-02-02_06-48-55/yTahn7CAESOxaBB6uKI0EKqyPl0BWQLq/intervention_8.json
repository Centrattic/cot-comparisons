I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a young woman in her early 20s, was at the treadmill area of the gym when a man in his late 30s to 40s started staring at her. She confronted him by saying something about mirrors and his own body, which made him leave. However, gym staff later reprimanded her for bullying, but another staff member later confirmed the guy was known for such behavior.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and mutual respect. The guy was clearly making the author uncomfortable by staring, which is a form of harassment. The author's response was direct and confrontational, which is understandable given the situation. But the question is whether her actions were appropriate or if she overstepped.\n\nThe gym staff's initial reaction took her side, but the second staff member indicated that the man had a history of such behavior. So, there's a context where the man's behavior was problematic. The author's insult was a reaction to harassment, which is a defense mechanism. However, the use of a derogatory or potentially offensive remark might be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate in a public setting, especially if it led to escalation, even if he left.\n\nBut considering that the man's behavior is on the problematic side, the author's response can be seen as a justified self-advocacy. The gym's policy might emphasize de-escalation and reporting, but the author acted in the moment to stop harassment. The staff's taking his side might not be fair, as the author was the victim here.\n\nSo, the debate is between the author's right to protect herself from harassment versus adhering to gym policies. Since harassment is a serious issue, her reaction, while direct, was in response to an immediate threat to her comfort and safety. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. But maybe she could have handled it more diplomatically, but given the circumstances, her actions were understandable.\n"
