I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. The user themselves think the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author, a woman in her early 20s, is at a mostly empty gym and notices a man in his late 30s to 40s staring at her, specifically at her chest. She confronts him, he doesn't respond appropriately, and she retorts with a comment about him looking in the mirror at his own body. The gym staff then sides with the man, accusing her of bullying, but another staff member later confirms the man has a history of similar inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe key points here are: 1. The man's behavior was inappropriately staring. 2. The author's response was a direct and confrontational remark. 3. The gym staff initially took the man's side, possibly due to the nature of his subtle harassment. 4. The author is questioning if her reaction was justified.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The man's behavior is clearly harassment, and the author felt threatened. However, her response was aggressive and could be seen as verbal harassment. The staff's reaction was based on their policy to avoid conflict, but the second staff member's input shows the man's pattern of behavior.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response was appropriate. On one hand, she was responding to harassment. On the other, using a derogatory comment might not be the best approach in a public setting, especially if it could escalate the situation or lead to her being disciplined. However, given the man's prior history, her action might be seen as self-defense against harassment.\n\nBut in terms of institutional policies, gyms often have rules against harassment, so if the staff's first response was to side with the harasser, that's a problem. However, the author's method of confronting him directly might not align with the gym's conflict resolution procedures. So, technically, she might be in the wrong according to the gym's rules, but ethically, her reaction is understandable given the harassment.\n\nBut the user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer depends on the perspective. If the focus is on her words and the gym's policy, then yes, she might be in the wrong. If the focus is on the harassment she experienced, then she's not in the wrong. The question is tricky because it's a gray area. However, the staff's initial response was to take the man's side, which is problematic, but the author's response might not be the best approach in a public setting. So, the answer could be a mix, but since the user wants a yes or no, I need to pick between A or B. Considering that she used an insult, which might not be the best method, but her intent was to stop harassment. Maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for a better approach. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If we strictly go by the gym's rules, maybe A. If we consider the harassment, maybe B. But since the staff was biased, that complicates it. Overall, I think the answer is B (No), because she was responding to harassment, and while her method could be debated, her intent is justifiable. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe A because she crossed a line with the insult. Hmm.\n"
