I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman at the gym who was being stared at by a man, and she responded by telling him to look at his own reflection. Then a staff member took her side initially but later, after another staff member explained the man's history, maybe things changed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The woman was uncomfortable and felt harassed, so her reaction might be seen as self-defense. The man was staring inappropriately, which is creepy and not okay. The woman's response was direct and maybe confrontational, but it's a common reaction when someone feels targeted. However, she admitted that maybe she should have gone to a staff member instead of confronting him herself. \n\nThe staff's reaction is important. The first staff member took the man's side, but the second staff member confirmed that the man had a history of such behavior. That suggests that the staff might have been handling it incorrectly initially. The woman's action might have been justified given the man's behavior, but using a derogatory comment could be seen as unprofessional or aggressive. \n\nBut the key here is whether her response was appropriate. She was in a difficult situation, feeling harassed. Insulting someone, even if they deserve it, can lead to conflicts. However, considering the man's behavior was inappropriate, her response might be seen as a reasonable reaction to harassment. The gym staff's handling of the situation was also problematic because they failed to address the man's history. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because she was defending herself against harassment. The staff should have supported her more after the second staff member's input. The answer hinges on whether her response was reasonable under the circumstances. Since the man was being creepy and she felt threatened, her reaction, while direct, could be justified.\n"
