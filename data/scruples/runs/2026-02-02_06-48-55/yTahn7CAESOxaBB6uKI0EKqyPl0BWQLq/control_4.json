I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a woman at the gym is being stared at by a man, and she responds by telling him to look in the mirror at his own breasts. Then gym staff sides with the man, accusing her of bullying.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. The woman was uncomfortable because the man was staring at her in a sexualized way. She asked him what he wanted, but he didn't respond appropriately. Her retort was a bit confrontational but not violent. The staff's reaction seems to be taking the man's side, which is problematic because the man was the one exhibiting inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the man's behavior. Staring in a sexualized manner is inappropriate and makes the woman uncomfortable. The woman's response was a form of self-defense in a way, using a verbal jab to stop the harassment. However, her approach could be seen as aggressive or inappropriate in a public setting. The staff's handling of the situation is also questionable because they should have addressed the man's behavior rather than disciplining the woman.\n\nBut considering that the other staff member later confirmed the man had a history of such behavior, it's clear the initial staff person didn't handle it correctly. The woman's reaction, while maybe not the best approach, was a response to being harassed. It's important to note that the man's actions were the root issue here. The woman was defending herself against unwanted attention, which is a form of harassment. So, even if her response wasn't the most appropriate, the blame shouldn't be on her. The gym's management should have policies in place to handle harassment, but in this case, they failed to protect the woman.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The wrong actions were by the man, and the staff's failure to support her. The woman had a right to feel unsafe and respond as she did, even if the method wasn't perfect.\n"
