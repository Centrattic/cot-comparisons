I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. \n\nFirst, the situation: The woman is at the gym, which she's new to and self-conscious. A man is on the adjacent treadmill, moving very slowly, staring at her, and not engaging in proper exercise. She confronts him, he doesn't respond appropriately, and she tells him to look at the mirror to stare at his own body. The gym staff then sides with the man, accusing her of bullying, and she leaves after learning the man has a history of such behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here. The man was being creepy\u2014staring at her inappropriately. She tried to ignore him, then confronted him. When he didn't stop, she retorted with a sarcastic comment. The gym staff took his side, which is frustrating. Now, the question is whether she was in the wrong.\n\nFrom her perspective, she was dealing with a clear violation of personal space and comfort. The man's behavior was inappropriate, and she felt threatened. Her response was a direct retort to confront his behavior. But she used a somewhat aggressive come-back. However, the gym's staff didn't handle it well, possibly due to not believing her account, which is a problem.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, her initial reaction was defensive. She was trying to assert her space against someone being creepy. However, using a confrontational response might not be the most effective or appropriate way in a public place. But considering her anxiety and the situation, maybe her reaction is understandable. The issue here is whether her words cross into bullying. \"Stare at your own tits\" is a sharp retort, but it's a direct response to his behavior. The gym staff's failure to address the man's history and instead penalizing her is a systemic issue, but the question is about her actions.\n\nSo, from a strict perspective, she did confront someone inappropriately with a verbal jab. But given the context of being targeted and the staff's mishandling, her reaction is justified. The answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong because the man was the aggressor. Hence, answer B.\n"
