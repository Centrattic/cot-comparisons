I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a woman in her early 20s, is at the gym and a man is staring at her. She confronts him by saying he should look at his own reflection, which makes him leave. Then, gym staff told her to stop what she was doing because the man claimed she bullied him. Another staff member later tells her that the man is known for this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the man's actions. If he was indeed staring inappropriately and being creepy, that's a problem. The author was uncomfortable and tried to handle it by confronting him. However, using a sarcastic or potentially offensive comment might have crossed a line. But the staff didn't believe her and took the man's side, which complicates things.\n\nThe question is whether her response was justified. Some might say that she had the right to defend herself from harassment, even if her method was harsh. Others might argue that she should have reported the behavior to staff instead of confronting him herself. The staff's reaction is also confusing because they didn't believe her, which might indicate issues with how the gym handles such situations.\n\nSo, if the man was a known creep, maybe the gym should have taken action against him, not the woman. The author's comment, while possibly not the best way to handle it, was a reaction to harassment. The staff's failure to support her might mean the problem lies more with the gym's policies than the author's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, using a confrontational and possibly offensive remark could lead to misunderstandings, especially if the staff doesn't witness the harassment. So, even if the man was wrong, the author's method of dealing with it might not be the most appropriate. But given the context, her actions seem like a reasonable response to harassment, and she shouldn't be blamed for standing up for herself.\n"
