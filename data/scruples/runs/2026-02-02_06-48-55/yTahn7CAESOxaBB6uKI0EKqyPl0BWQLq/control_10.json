I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author, a woman in her early 20s, was at the gym on a treadmill. Another man nearby was walking very slowly and staring at her, not engaging in real exercise. When she asked him what he wanted, he just grunted and continued staring. She then told him to look at his own reflection, which shocked him into leaving. However, gym staff later confronted her for bullying him, taking his side. Another staff member later confirmed the man had a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The man was clearly making her uncomfortable with his staring, which is a form of harassment. The author's response was direct but confrontational. She used a sarcastic remark to tell him to look elsewhere. While this was a natural reaction to being harassed, the staff's response was to side with the man, possibly due to his age or other biases. \n\nLegally, in many places, harassment in public spaces like a gym is prohibited. The man's behavior could be considered harassment. The author's response was a direct form of self-advocacy. However, using a confrontational approach might have escalated the situation, even if it didn't here. The staff's reaction suggests that they prioritized the man's feelings over her safety, which is problematic.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the man was harassing her, she confronted him in a way that made him leave, and the staff handled it poorly. The author's actions were a response to harassment, and while her choice of words might be seen as harsh, they were a reaction to being made uncomfortable. The staff's failure to support her is a separate issue.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, harassment is on the man. The author's actions were in self-defense of her personal space and comfort. The use of a sarcastic or aggressive retort is a common reaction when someone is being harassed. While it's possible she could have approached a staff member first, that's not always feasible in the heat of the moment. So, the author isn't in the wrong for defending herself against harassment. The real issue is the man's behavior and the gym's inadequate response.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
