I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The author was staring at the woman's chest, ignored her polite question, and she told him to look at his own reflection. The gym staff took the creepy guy's side, but later another staff member confirmed he's known for this behavior.\n\nFirst, the creepy guy was clearly in the wrong by staring inappropriately. The woman tried to address it politely but got ignored. Her reaction was a direct response to his harassment. Insults aren't ideal, but the context is important. She was in a vulnerable situation, self-conscious, and dealing with harassment. The gym staff didn't support her properly, which is a problem too. \n\nThe key points are: Was her response justified? The guy was violating her personal space and making her uncomfortable. While name-calling might not be the best approach, the intent was to stop harassment. The staff's failure to address the guy's behavior properly also plays a role here. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to being harassed. While the method was confrontational, the underlying issue is the harassment. The staff's handling of the situation is flawed, but the question is about her being in the wrong. Given the context, her response was a self-advocacy move. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that she should have used a different approach. However, in the moment, people react under stress. Considering all factors, the answer leans towards B.\n"
