I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman in her early 20s who went to the gym and encountered a man who was staring at her. She confronted him with a sarcastic comment about him staring at his own reflection, and then a staff member reprimanded her for bullying him. Another staff member later explained that the man was known for such behavior.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The man was staring inappropriately, which is a form of harassment. The author was uncomfortable and felt threatened. Her response was to confront him with a direct and maybe humorous but offensive retort. \n\nBut the staff took the man's side, possibly because they can't take sides in interpersonal conflicts, or maybe they have policies against aggressive language. However, the second staff member confirmed the man had a history of such behavior. So the staff might have been biased or not handling it correctly.\n\nLegally, the man's behavior could be considered harassment. The author's response, while perhaps unprofessional, was a reaction to being harassed. However, using the word \"tits\" might be seen as inappropriate language. But it's also a direct response to his action. \n\nIn terms of workplace policies, gyms often have rules about respectful behavior. If the staff is required to enforce these rules neutrally, they might have to reprimand both parties. But since the man had a history, maybe the staff should have supported the author more. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was a reasonable reaction to harassment. If she felt unsafe, confronting the man directly might be her only option until staff intervene. However, the gym's policy might require reporting such incidents to staff, not handling it personally. \n\nSo, on one hand, the author was defending herself against harassment. On the other, her method involved using language that could be seen as bullying. But given the context of being harassed, her reaction might be justified as self-defense. The staff's handling might be flawed, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the gym staff. The man's behavior is clearly inappropriate. The author's response, while maybe not the most professional, was a reaction to being harassed. So, she might not be in the wrong. \n\nHowever, using the term \"tits\" could be seen as aggressive language. But considering the situation, her intent was to stop harassment, which is a valid reason. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
