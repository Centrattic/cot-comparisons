I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nThe situation is at a gym where the woman is on a treadmill. The guy next to her is walking very slowly and staring at her. She turns off her treadmill to ask him what he wants, but he's still staring at her chest. She then tells him to look at the mirror and stare at his own, which shocks him into leaving. Later, gym staff confronts her, taking the guy's side, and she finds out the guy is known for this behavior but hard to catch.\n\nFirst, the guy's actions are clearly inappropriate. Staring at someone's body parts without consent is a form of harassment. The woman felt uncomfortable and had the right to defend herself. Her reaction, while direct, was a response to being harassed. She didn't use violence and her words were a verbal retort, which might be considered a justified reaction given the situation.\n\nHowever, the gym staff's response is problematic. They side with the harasser, which could indicate a lack of proper training or protocols to handle such incidents. The woman's approach might be seen as confrontational, but given the context, it's understandable she wanted to end the harassment immediately. The fact that the gym staff knew about the guy's behavior but couldn't act on it adds to the complexity. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the woman was responding to harassment. The issue here is more about the gym's failure to protect members than the woman's actions. So, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong. Her reaction was justified given the circumstances, even if it's not the most conventional approach. The blame lies more with the harasser and the gym's inadequate handling.\n"
