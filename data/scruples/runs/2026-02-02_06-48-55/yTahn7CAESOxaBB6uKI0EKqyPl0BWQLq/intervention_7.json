I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe writer is a young woman in her early 20s who's new to the gym. She's self-conscious but trying to work out. One day, a middle-aged man starts using the treadmill next to her but moves very slowly, almost not exercising. He's staring at her, specifically at her chest, and when she confronts him, he just grunts. She then tells him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body, which shocks him and makes him leave. Later, gym staff reprimands her, taking the man's side, but another staff member reveals he's known for this behavior. The writer is unsure if she was wrong to insult him.\n\nFirst, the man's actions are clearly inappropriate. Staring in a way that makes someone uncomfortable, especially focusing on their body, is a form of harassment. The woman was in her own space, trying to exercise, and the man encroached on that by staring. His behavior was creepy and unwelcome.\n\nThe woman's response was direct and confrontational. She called out his behavior in a sarcastic way. While her words might be seen as rude or aggressive, her intent was to stop the harassment. The gym staff initially took her words at face value, thinking she was bullying the man, but another staff member later confirmed the man's history. This suggests that the initial staff judgment was flawed.\n\nNow, considering if she was in the wrong: She didn't physically harm him or threaten him. She responded with words to a situation where she felt harassed. The man's behavior was the root issue here. However, using a derogatory comment might escalate the situation or not be the best approach in a public space. But given the context, she was under stress and wanted to end the harassment immediately. Her reaction, while not the most diplomatic, was a direct response to being made uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, involving staff might have been a better approach, but if she did that immediately, maybe the man would have continued his behavior. Also, the staff didn't act appropriately at first. The second staff member admitted they couldn't take action because the man was subtle. So, maybe she had to take matters into her own hands to protect herself.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the man was definitely in the wrong. The woman's actions were a reaction to harassment. While her words could be seen as harsh, they were a response to being made to feel unsafe. So, she's not in the wrong for standing up for herself. The situation is more about the man's behavior and the staff's inadequate response.\n"
