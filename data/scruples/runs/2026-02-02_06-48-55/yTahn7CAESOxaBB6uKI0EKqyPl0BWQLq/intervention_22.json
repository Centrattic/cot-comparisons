I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman at the gym who felt harassed by a man staring at her and responded with an insult. The gym staff took the man's side, and the woman is now wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The woman was in a situation where she felt uncomfortable and unsafe. The man's behavior\u2014staring at her inappropriately, especially in a setting where others might not notice\u2014could be considered harassment. The woman's immediate reaction was to confront him directly. She used a sarcastic, maybe even aggressive comment to make him stop. \n\nBut then the gym staff reprimanded her for talking to him that way, and another staff member later informed her that the man had a history. So the staff's initial response was to take the man's complaint over hers. That's a problem in itself, maybe indicating a failure in the gym's handling of harassment. But the question is about whether the woman was in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the options: A says she's in the wrong, B says she's not. \n\nThe woman's response was a verbal retort. Depending on the context, if she was in immediate danger, she might have needed to escalate to staff immediately. But given that she was in a public place and the man was being subtle, she might not have felt physically threatened. However, the psychological discomfort is real. \n\nHer comment was direct and confrontational. If the man was indeed harassing her, then her response could be seen as a form of self-advocacy. But the gym staff's intervention suggests they might have a policy against direct confrontation between members, even if it's to address harassment. \n\nBut the key here is whether her actions were justified. The staff's taking the man's side might be due to policy, but the man's behavior was inappropriate. The woman's response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was in response to harassment. \n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, harassment is a serious issue. If the man was indeed harassing her, the woman's response is understandable. However, the gym's role is to mediate such situations to prevent escalation. \n\nSo, the answer could hinge on whether the woman's actions were a reasonable response to harassment. If so, then she's not in the wrong. If the gym's rules require reporting incidents to staff rather than confronting individuals, then she might be at fault. \n\nBut given that the man was known for such behavior and the staff's initial response was biased, the woman might not have a choice but to act in self-defense of her dignity. The question is whether the insult was an acceptable form of self-expression in that context. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to report harassment to authorities rather than handle it themselves. However, the woman was in a situation where she felt ignored or not taken seriously by the staff initially. \n\nConsidering all this, the woman's actions might be seen as justified given the harassment she experienced. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
