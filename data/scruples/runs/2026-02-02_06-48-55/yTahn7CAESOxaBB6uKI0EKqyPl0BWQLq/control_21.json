I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is at the gym. The author is a woman in her early 20s, not very into exercise, and she's been going there a few times a week. She's self-conscious, which makes sense. Then, there's this guy around late 30s to 40s who starts using the treadmill next to her but is walking very slowly. She notices he's staring at her, specifically at her chest area. She turns off her treadmill to ask him what he wants, but he just grunts and keeps staring. She gets uncomfortable and tells him to stare at his own body in the mirror. He leaves. Then a staff member confronts her, saying she can't talk to people like that, taking the guy's side. Another staff member later tells her that the guy is known for this kind of inappropriate behavior.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The guy was being creepy and staring at her inappropriately. She tried to confront him, but he didn't back off. Her response was to tell him to look in the mirror and stare at his own body. The staff then reprimanded her for bullying the guy, even though another staff member later validated that the guy is known for this behavior.\n\nFirst, from a moral standpoint, if someone is being harassed or made uncomfortable by another person's inappropriate behavior, standing up for oneself can be justified. However, the way she responded was with a sarcastic or confrontational remark. The problem here is that the staff didn't support her, possibly because her response was confrontational rather than reporting the behavior through proper channels. The gym staff might have policies on how to handle such situations, expecting employees to be the ones to intervene rather than patrons. So, while her intent was self-defense against harassment, using a verbal retort might have been seen as aggressive rather than a reportable incident. \n\nBut the other side is that the guy was being a creep, and she faced a hostile environment. The fact that another staff member later confirmed the guy's history suggests that the first staff member might have misjudged the situation or didn't handle it properly. The author's reaction was a direct response to harassment, which could be considered justified. However, the gym might have rules about how to address such issues, and she might have been in the wrong for not following protocol. But in terms of personal responsibility and self-defense, she might not be at fault. \n\nSo, the key points: The guy was being inappropriate. She tried to address it directly, which is reasonable. The staff's response was inadequate. Her verbal response, while direct, was a reaction to harassment. Whether she's in the wrong depends on the context of the gym's policies. If the gym expects employees to handle such situations, then she might have overstepped. However, given that the guy was a known creep and her intention was self-defense, she's not entirely in the wrong. The staff's failure to support her properly is a separate issue.\n"
