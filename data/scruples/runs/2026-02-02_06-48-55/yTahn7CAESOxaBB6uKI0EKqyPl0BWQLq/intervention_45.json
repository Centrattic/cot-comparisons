I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she was at the gym on a treadmill, and another guy came over, started walking very slowly, and was staring at her. She asked him what he wanted, he didn't respond properly, and she told him to look at the mirror and stare at his own \"tits\". Then the gym staff came and said she bullied him, even though another staff member later said he was known for being creepy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy was staring at her inappropriately. She felt uncomfortable and tried to ignore him first. When he kept staring, she confronted him. Her response was a bit direct and maybe a bit harsh, but was it justified?\n\nIn terms of harassment, if someone is making you feel unsafe or is being inappropriately, confronting them can be a way to protect oneself. However, the way she did it might have been unprofessional. Gym staff are there to handle such situations, so maybe she should have asked a staff member first instead of confronting him directly. But then again, if she didn't feel safe enough to call for help, maybe her reaction was necessary for her own comfort.\n\nAlso, the staff took his side initially, which is part of the problem. If the gym isn't addressing the creep's behavior, that's bad. The author's response was a way to stand up for herself. While the wording she used might have been aggressive, the intent was to stop harassment. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. Legally, if someone is being harassed, the victim isn't at fault for defending themselves. However, gyms often have rules about how to handle situations, so maybe she violated those. But the main issue here is the creep's behavior. The author's reaction was in response to being made uncomfortable and harassed. \n\nSo, maybe she's not in the wrong because she was responding to harassment. The staff's failure to address the creep's behavior is a bigger issue. But some might argue that she should have used a different approach. However, given the situation, her response was a direct way to end the harassment quickly. \n\nI think the key is whether her actions were a proportionate response to being harassed. Since she was the victim, it's more about the staff not handling it properly. The author isn't in the wrong for defending herself from inappropriate behavior.\n"
