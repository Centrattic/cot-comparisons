I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a young woman at the gym. She's self-conscious but trying to get into shape. There's a man in his late 30s/early 40s who's on a treadmill next to her but moving very slowly. He's staring at her, specifically at her chest, not her face. She turns off her treadmill and asks him what he wants. He just grunts and keeps staring. She gets uncomfortable and tells him to look at the mirror and stare at his own body. He leaves. Then staff comes and takes her side, but another staff member later says the guy is known for this behavior.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the user is asking for my opinion. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) or B for no (not wrong). \n\nFirst, let's look at the man's actions. He's inappropriately staring, which is a form of harassment. He's in a public place, but his behavior is creepy and makes her uncomfortable. The author's response was to confront him with a sarcastic comment. \n\nNow, the staff took his side initially, but another staff member later confirmed the man has a history. So maybe the staff's initial reaction was biased or they wanted to avoid conflict. \n\nThe author's actions: she confronted him in a public place. Her comment was direct and confrontational. The question is whether that was wrong. On one hand, she was defending herself against harassment. On the other, using a sarcastic or potentially offensive remark could be seen as unprofessional or aggressive. However, given the context of harassment, some might argue it was justified.\n\nBut in terms of institutional policy, gyms might have rules about how to handle conflicts. Maybe the author should have reported the man to staff immediately instead of confronting him directly. However, she tried to ignore him first, then asked him directly when he was being obvious. When he didn't respond, she escalated. The staff's initial reaction was to take his side, which might indicate that the gym isn't handling harassment well. \n\nThe key here is whether her response was appropriate. The comment \"go stare at your own tits\" could be seen as disrespectful, but it's a direct response to harassment. It's possible that the gym's policy prohibits harassment and the man's behavior is the real issue. The author's reaction was to defend herself, which is understandable. But maybe she could have used a different approach, like reporting immediately. \n\nBut given the context, she was in a vulnerable situation. Confronting the man directly might have been her only way to feel safe in the moment. The fact that the staff later confirmed the man's history supports her actions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the standards. If the gym's policy is strict about how to handle such situations, maybe she should have reported it. But if we're judging from a human rights or harassment prevention standpoint, her response was reasonable given the harassment she was experiencing. The staff's initial reaction was flawed, but that's on the gym, not the author. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions were a self-defense response to harassment. While the wording might be harsh, the intent was to stop the harassment. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
