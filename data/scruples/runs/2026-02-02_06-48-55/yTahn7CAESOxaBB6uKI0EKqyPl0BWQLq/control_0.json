I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for insulting a creepy guy at the gym. The situation is that the guy was staring at her, and she responded by telling him to look at his own body in the mirror.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy was being inappropriately creepy, staring at her for a long time while she was on the treadmill. The gym was empty, so there were no witnesses initially. The staff later mentioned he was known for such behavior but had been subtle enough to avoid being banned before.\n\nThe author's response was direct and confrontational. She asked if she could help him, and when he didn't respond appropriately, she insulted him. The staff member took his side, possibly because they didn't witness the staring and only heard her version after the fact.\n\nNow, the question is whether her reaction was justified. In many cases, people might advise de-escalation or reporting the behavior to staff first. However, the staff later confirmed that the guy had a history of this behavior. So maybe she did the right thing by confronting him when there was no one else around. But she did use an insult, which might be seen as harsh. \n\nBut wait, the guy was violating her personal space and making her uncomfortable. The author might have felt they couldn't approach staff in the moment because there was no one else there. The staff member's response was to side with him, perhaps due to lack of evidence. So the author's action could have been her only option to make him stop. \n\nIs there a better way? Maybe, like reporting him after the fact. But in the heat of the moment, people might act differently. The other staff member did confirm the guy's history, which suggests that her reaction wasn't unwarranted. \n\nSo considering all that, the author probably wasn't in the wrong because the guy was being inappropriately creepy. Her response, while direct, was a reaction to his behavior. The staff's initial response was flawed since they didn't have the full context. The correct answer would be B, No.\n"
