I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the woman who insulted a creepy guy at the gym is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy was on a treadmill next to her, staring at her breasts instead of using the machine properly. She confronted him, which made him leave, but the gym staff then intervened, taking his side because he claimed she bullied him. However, another staff member later confirmed he's known for such behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her response was appropriate. The guy was being creepy and making her uncomfortable. She tried to ignore him first, then turned off her treadmill to ask what he wanted. When he didn't respond politely, she used a sarcastic, insulting comment. While the comment is rude, the context is important: being harassed in a public space. \n\nThe staff's initial reaction might have been based on the idea that staff can't get involved in customer disputes without clear evidence. Since the guy said she bullied him, the staff might have had to take both sides into account. However, the second staff member's confirmation that the guy is a known creep adds nuance. The woman was defending herself against harassment, which is a serious issue.\n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Legally, unless she made threats or used violence, her words alone might not be a problem. Ethically, though, responding with a harsh insult could be seen as unprofessional, even if justified. The staff might prefer handling such situations without confrontational language to maintain a respectful environment. On the other hand, she was acting in self-defense in a way that's common when someone feels harassed. \n\nIn some cases, a more direct approach, like reporting to staff immediately, might be better. But given the context, her reaction was a response to being made uncomfortable by someone's inappropriate behavior. The fact that the staff later confirmed the guy's history suggests that her initial judgment was correct, but the method of confronting him might be where the issue lies. So, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the staff's policy is to not allow such language, then technically she violated that. But if we consider the harassment she was experiencing, her reaction was about protecting herself. The answer might depend on the gym's specific policies and whether verbal confrontation is allowed. However, given that the guy was being creepy and she was the victim, her actions could be seen as justified even if the staff didn't handle it correctly. So, probably not in the wrong, but maybe the gym's staff handling is the bigger issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
