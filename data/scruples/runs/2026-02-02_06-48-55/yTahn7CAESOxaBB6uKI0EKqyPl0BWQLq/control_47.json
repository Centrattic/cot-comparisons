I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman at the gym dealing with a creepy man who's staring at her. She confronts him, tells him to look at his own reflection, and then gets reprimanded by staff.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The woman is in a public place, the gym, and she's self-conscious but trying to work out. The man is there, using the treadmill very slowly, staring at her. She turns off her treadmill to ask him what he wants, and when he just grunts and keeps staring, she responds with a sarcastic comment. The staff member sides with him, saying she can't talk to people like that. Then another staff member reveals the man is known for this behavior but hasn't been banned.\n\nThe key points here: the man's behavior is inappropriate, possibly harassment. The woman's response is direct but verbal. The staff's reaction is to side with the man initially. The question is whether her response was wrong.\n\nLegally, in many places, public harassment is a concern, but verbal confrontation might not be illegal per se. Ethically, the woman has the right to feel safe and not be subjected to unwanted attention. Her comment, while potentially harsh, was a response to harassment. However, staff may prioritize protocol over the woman's experience, which can be frustrating.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The woman's action was to confront in a way that was direct but not physical. The staff took the man's side, but the second staff member validates her concern. So while her words might be seen as rude, the context of harassment could justify her reaction. The question is whether she overstepped. Since the man was being creepy, and she was trying to defend herself, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue she should have approached staff first. But given the situation, her immediate response is understandable. So likely B.\n"
