I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The author is a woman in her early 20s who's new to the gym. She's self-conscious but trying to work out. A man in his late 30s/early 40s is on a treadmill nearby, moving very slowly and staring at her instead of using the equipment properly. She turns off her treadmill to confront him, and even after she asks what he wants, he continues to stare. She then tells him to go look in the mirror at his own body, which shocks him into leaving. Later, staff sides with him, claiming she bullied him, but another staff member reveals he's known for this behavior.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle here. The man's behavior is clearly inappropriate\u2014staring in a way that makes her uncomfortable and isn't his own exercise. The author's response is a direct confrontation, using a sarcastic comment to address the situation. She's reacting to harassment, which is a valid concern. However, the gym staff seems biased towards the man, possibly due to his subtle, repeat behavior that's hard to prove. \n\nIs her reaction justified? She was in a public place, being harassed, and felt unsafe. Insulting someone can be seen as aggressive, but in the context of harassment, self-defense or immediate action might be necessary. However, the gym has rules about how to handle conflicts, so she might have been expected to report it to staff first. But given that the man was known for this behavior, and staff didn't act, her direct action could also be seen as a necessary step when the system failed her.\n\nOn the other hand, using a confrontational approach could escalate the situation. But the author's intent was to stop harassment, which is a valid self-defense mechanism. The staff's reaction might be a result of not understanding the context of the man's behavior, which another staff member later clarified. So, in this case, the author's actions were in response to harassment, which is a serious issue. Her words were a direct and immediate response to a threatening situation, which might be justified given the circumstances. The gym's failure to address his known behavior contributes to her feeling the need to take matters into her own hands. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were a reaction to harassment. While using a confrontational approach isn't ideal in every situation, the context here makes her actions understandable and justified.\n"
