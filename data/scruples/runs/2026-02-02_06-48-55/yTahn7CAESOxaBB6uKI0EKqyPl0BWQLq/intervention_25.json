I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman at the gym who felt harassed by a man staring at her, and she responded with a sarcastic comment. Then the gym staff took her to task for it, but another staff member later confirmed the man was known for inappropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The woman was in a public place, maybe a bit self-conscious, and encountered a man who was staring in a way she found creepy. Her response was direct and confrontational, which led to the staff reprimanding her for bullying. However, it's revealed later that the man had a history of such behavior.\n\nSo the question is, was her response appropriate? On one hand, she was defending herself from harassment. On the other, the staff's immediate reaction didn't take into account the context. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nI should consider the context. The man's behavior was inappropriate, and the woman felt uncomfortable. Retorting with a comment like \"go stare at your own tits\" was a direct response to his harassment. While it's not a professional or calm approach, it's a form of self-defense in a situation where she felt violated. The staff's initial reaction was to side with the harasser, which is problematic. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nLegally, verbal confrontation might not violate any laws unless it's a direct threat. Ethically, she was reacting to harassment. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But the staff might have policies against aggressive communication, even if the context is harassment. However, the second staff member's confirmation that the man was known for harassment suggests that the first staff's judgment was flawed. \n\nTherefore, the author's reaction was a response to harassment. While the wording could have been different, the intent was to stop unwanted behavior. The gym staff's handling was poor, but the author isn't in the wrong for defending herself. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
