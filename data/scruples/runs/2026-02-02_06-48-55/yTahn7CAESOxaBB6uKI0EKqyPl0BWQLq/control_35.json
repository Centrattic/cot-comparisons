I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the woman who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for insulting a guy at the gym who was staring at her. The question is whether her response was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The woman was at the gym, self-conscious, and noticed a man staring at her. She approached him, asked what he wanted, and when he just stared, she told him to look at his own reflection. The gym staff took her side initially but then another staff member mentioned the man had a history of inappropriate behavior. The staff then took the man's side, leading her to leave.\n\nNow, the main points to consider: was the woman's response appropriate? The man was staring in a way that made her uncomfortable, which is a form of harassment. His behavior was unwanted and intrusive. The woman's reaction was to confront him with a sarcastic comment. While her words might be seen as rude or inappropriate, the underlying issue is his behavior. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the man's actions were definitely wrong. The woman had a right to feel unsafe and to react to defend herself. However, the way she reacted might not have been the best approach. Insulting someone could escalate the situation or lead to conflict. The gym staff's response was problematic because they didn't address the man's harassment, possibly due to his history. \n\nBut the question is about the woman's actions. Legally and ethically, the man was in the wrong. The woman's response, while perhaps not the most diplomatic, was a reaction to being harassed. The staff's failure to support her properly is another issue. \n\nSo, is the woman in the wrong? Her comment was in response to harassment. While it's true that using a derogatory or aggressive comment might not be the best approach, the situation is about self-defense and asserting boundaries. In many cases, people are encouraged to speak up against harassment. However, the response might affect how the situation is perceived, especially in a formal setting where staff rely on reports. \n\nBut given that the man had a history, the woman's actions were justified in defending herself. The staff should have supported her, but that's their failure. The woman's main mistake was maybe not reporting the incident promptly to the staff instead of confronting him directly. But considering the harassment she faced, her reaction was understandable. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Her actions were a response to harassment, and the responsibility lies with the man's inappropriate behavior, not her reaction to it.\n"
