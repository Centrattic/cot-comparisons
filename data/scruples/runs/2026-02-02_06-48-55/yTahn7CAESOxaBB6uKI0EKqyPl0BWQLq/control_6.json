I've recently started going to the gym. I'm pretty out of shape as I've never really done exercise since finishing school. I'm quite self conscious about exercising in front of people but I've forced myself to start going a few times a week. So far, it's not been bad. I usually just put my earphones in and I can get on with what I'm doing. \n\nYesterday was when it happened. I was running on a treadmill and the gym was pretty empty at the time so I was the only one using them. After about 10 minites, this guy goes on the treadmill next to me but he's not really using it. He looks like he's maybe in his late 30s/early 40s. He's walking quite slowly on it. So slow, that it's barely exercise. I notice after a minute that he's actually staring at me. I tried to ignore him but eventually I turned my treadmill off to ask him what he wanted. \n\nAt this point, I'm facing him and he's staring at my boobs. He's not even trying to look at my face. I asked him \"can I help you with something?\" To which he just kinda grunted and shook his head, still staring. It was making me really uncomfortable and annoyed that he just didn't care bow obvious he was being so I said to him \"there's mirrors over there, go and stare at your own tits\" and weirdly it shocked him and he left. I didn't think it would work. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes, a member of staff approaches me and asks me to stop what I'm doing. Apparently, the creepy guy told her that I had bullied him because I didn't want him using the treadmills. I explained what he had done and she just said I can't talk to people like that. She was taking his side??? Wtf. So I just left. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. On the way out though, another member of staff stopped me and told me that this creepy guy was actually known for staring at women and acting inappropriately. They've never been able to ban him or anything because he's so subtle about what he does (making sure no one else is around etc.)\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said what I did to him and maybe just told a member of staff to get him to move or something but at the same time, I feel like my reaction was totally justified.\n\nTL;DR creepy old guy was staring at my boobs at the gym so I told him to go look in the mirror and stare at his own tits. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for insulting a creep at the gym. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe woman is at the gym, and a man stares at her for a long time while she's on the treadmill. When she asks him what he wants, he grunts and keeps staring. She then tells him to look at his own reflection in the mirror and he leaves. The staff later takes her side because the creepy guy had a history of inappropriate behavior.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The man was clearly being inconsiderate and possibly harassing her. She tried to ignore him first, then confront him politely. When that didn't work, she responded with a sarcastic remark. The staff took his complaint seriously at first but later acknowledged his behavior. \n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, the man's staring could be considered harassment, especially if it's persistent and makes someone uncomfortable. The woman's response was a direct retort, which might be seen as self-defense in terms of dealing with harassment. However, using a derogatory comment like \"stare at your own tits\" could be seen as aggressive or inappropriate, even if the man was at fault. \n\nBut considering the context, she was trying to protect herself from unwanted attention. The staff eventually confirmed that the man had a history of such behavior, which suggests that her actions were justified. The problem here is that the staff initially took the man's side, which might indicate a failure in handling harassment complaints properly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the woman was within her rights to feel uncomfortable and to respond to protect herself. While the language she used might not be the most professional, it was a reaction to harassment. The staff might have been more appropriate to handle it, but she didn't have the time or resources to do that in the moment. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the woman's actions were a response to harassment and self-defense. The staff's initial bias towards the man is a bigger issue here than the woman's response. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. \n\nAnswer B.\n"
