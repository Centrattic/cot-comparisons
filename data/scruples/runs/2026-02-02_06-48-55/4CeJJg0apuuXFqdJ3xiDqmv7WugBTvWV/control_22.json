      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to dinner with their wife and best friend to meet the friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticized the shirt the person was wearing, which was a gift from their wife. The person then told the girlfriend to \"go fuck herself,\" leading her to storm off and the friend to leave with her.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author's best friend's girlfriend insulted him. The shirt was a Christmas gift from his wife, making it significant to him. The reaction was pretty strong\u2014telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is definitely rude and confrontational. \n\nBut why did the author react that way? Maybe they felt disrespected, especially since the shirt was a gift. But in a first meeting, how appropriate is it to respond with such a harsh insult? Even if someone makes a comment you don't like, reacting in such a way could escalate the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might have been intended as a joke or an awkward icebreaker. The author's response was immediate and harsh, which might have been unnecessary. The article is asking if they're the asshole, so the community usually looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nAlso, the author's wife was present, and she showed shock. That might indicate that even their spouse was surprised by the author's reaction, which could suggest that the reaction was out of line. \n\nThe key points here are: the initial insult, the personal significance of the shirt, and the aggressive response. The girlfriend's comment was a personal attack on the author's choice of clothing, which was a gift. But even so, responding with a curse-laden insult is probably not the best approach. \n\nIn social situations, especially with someone's significant other, maintaining composure is usually expected. The author's reaction caused the girlfriend to leave and the friend to follow her, which might have ruined the dinner. So, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was even more so. Therefore, the author is likely at fault here.\n"
