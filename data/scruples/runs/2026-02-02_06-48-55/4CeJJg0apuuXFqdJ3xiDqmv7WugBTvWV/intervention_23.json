      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend criticized his shirt right after being introduced. The shirt was a Christmas gift from his wife, so he's attached to it. He responded with a harsh comment, leading the girlfriend to leave. The friend and girlfriend then left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriateness. Commenting on someone's clothing can be seen as rude, but the context matters. The girlfriend might have meant it as a joke or a lighthearted comment, but it could also come off as disrespectful. However, responding with \"go fuck yourself\" is definitely aggressive and unprofessional, especially in a social setting with his wife present.\n\nThe author's reaction seems excessive. Even if the girlfriend's comment was out of line, there are better ways to handle it than using a curse-laden response. The immediate effect was that she stormed off, which implies that his reaction escalated the situation. The friend's confusion and eventual departure with her suggests that the author's response damaged the social interaction.\n\nFrom a perspective of conflict resolution, it's important to address issues calmly. The author could have responded with humor or a polite counter, maybe even laughed it off. But choosing to say something so harsh immediately shows a lack of emotional control in a delicate situation. Also, considering that the shirt was a gift from his wife, the emotional aspect might have added to his frustration, but it doesn't justify the response.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a choice to react in a way that's likely to offend. The girlfriend's initial comment was a minor provocation, and the response was disproportionate. Even if she was rude, the author's reply was not a constructive way to handle it. \n\nI think the key points are: the girlfriend's comment, while possibly rude, doesn't warrant an aggressive retort. The author's reaction was inappropriate and caused the situation to escalate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
