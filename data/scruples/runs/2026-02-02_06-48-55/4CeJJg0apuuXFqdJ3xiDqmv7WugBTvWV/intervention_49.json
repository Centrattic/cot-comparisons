      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend insulted his shirt, which his wife had given him for Christmas, and he responded by telling her to go fuck herself. The girlfriend then left, and the friend followed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the immediate reaction of the author. Insulting someone's clothing, especially when given by a spouse, can be a sensitive issue. The girlfriend's comment was direct and possibly rude, but the author's response was even more so. Telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is a very strong and offensive retort, which is likely to escalate the situation rather than address it calmly.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I should consider whether that's accurate. Even though the girlfriend's comment was impolite, the appropriate response would be to address it without being aggressive. The author's reaction led to her storming off and the friend leaving, which seems like a significant fallout. \n\nAlso, the context of the meeting is important. It's a first meeting between the author and the girlfriend, and the environment is a dinner with the author's wife. The author's response might have caused embarrassment not just for himself but also for his wife and his friend. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's natural to feel defensive, responding with such a harsh insult is generally considered unacceptable. The author could have addressed the comment in a more respectful manner, perhaps by expressing his feelings without being confrontational. \n\nTherefore, the author's reaction was disproportionate and inconsiderate of the circumstances. He is in the wrong because his response was excessive and contributed to the negative outcome of the meeting.\n"
