      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a best friend's new girlfriend being rude about the writer's shirt, which was a gift from his wife. The writer then tells her to \"go fuck herself,\" leading to her leaving and the friend following.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations here. The girlfriend made a judgment about the shirt, which the writer found offensive. The immediate reaction was to insult her back. While the girlfriend's comment might have been rude, the writer's response was clearly aggressive and unprofessional. \n\nIn social situations, especially when meeting someone's partner for the first time, it's important to maintain composure. The writer's response didn't just address the comment but escalated the situation, leading to an uncomfortable exit. Even if the girlfriend was dismissive, the appropriate response might have been to express discomfort politely or let the friend handle the situation. \n\nAdditionally, the shirt being a gift from the wife adds emotional weight. The girlfriend's comment might have been a personal slight, but the writer's reaction was disproportionate. The key point is whether the response was justified. While the girlfriend was rude, the writer's response was hostile and unkind, which could be seen as inconsiderate and contributing to the conflict. \n\nConsidering all factors, the writer's actions crossed a line, making them the asshole in this scenario.\n"
