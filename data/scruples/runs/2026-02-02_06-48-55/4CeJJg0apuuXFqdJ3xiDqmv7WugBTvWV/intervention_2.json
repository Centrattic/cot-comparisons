My buddy introduced her and greet each other and then immediately after she looks me up and down and tell me that the shirt I\u2019m wearing is \u201chideous\u201d. \n\nNow I will not lie, I\u2019m not a fan of flannels buuuut my wife bought me this one for Christmas. Which means this is now my favorite shirt. \n\nI notice a look of shock on my wife\u2019s face and then I looked this girl dead in the eye and told her to go fuck herself. \n\nShe storms off and my buddy gives me this what just happened look and then follows her and they eventually leave. \n\nAm I The Asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's girlfriend insulted his shirt, which he really likes, and he responded with a harsh curse, leading to her leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Insulting someone's clothing in a first meeting is pretty rude. The girlfriend made a judgment about his outfit right away, which could be seen as impolite. The author, however, responded with a strong curse, which is also not polite.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should evaluate both sides. The girlfriend's comment was inappropriate, but the author's response was extreme. Even if the shirt was a gift and he's not a fan of flannels, a direct curse might have been an overreaction. There might be a better way to handle the situation, like ignoring the comment or responding politely.\n\nAlso, the context is a dinner with his wife and best friend. The author's reaction led to the girlfriend storming off and the friend leaving, which could damage relationships. The author's response might have been impulsive. While the girlfriend's behavior was rude, the author's response escalated the situation.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, responding with a curse is generally not acceptable, even if provoked. So, even though the girlfriend was in the wrong first, the author's reaction was inappropriate. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
