      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend insulted his shirt, which he really likes because his wife bought it. The author responded by telling her to \"go fuck herself,\" leading to her storming off and the friend leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Insulting someone's clothing is generally considered rude, but does that justify a harsh response? The author's reaction was pretty direct and aggressive. Even if the girlfriend was rude, responding with \"go fuck yourself\" is a strong comeback. It's possible that the author overreacted. \n\nAlso, the context matters. It was a first meeting between the author and the girlfriend. The author's wife was present, so her shock might indicate that the response was unexpected and maybe inappropriate. The author was defending his choice of clothing, which was a gift from his wife, so there's some emotional investment there. However, the way he handled it could have been worse, but was it wrong?\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's insult was immediate after the introduction, which might not have been the best approach. But the author's response escalated the situation. In social interactions, maintaining politeness is usually expected even if someone is rude. The author's reaction might have been a defense mechanism, but in public and especially in front of his wife and friend, it's a bad move. \n\nPossible consequences: the friend left, which could strain the relationship. The author might have damaged his friendship over a minor issue. The girlfriend might feel disrespected, and the author's action could be seen as unprofessional or immature. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial insult was rude, but responding with a curse and aggressive language is also not acceptable. The author could have handled it more gracefully, perhaps by making a joke or calmly pointing out the rudeness without being offensive. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong because his response was inappropriate despite the initial insult.\n"
