      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend insulted his shirt, which he really likes, and he responded by telling her to go fuck herself. Then she left, and the friend followed her. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the actions and motivations. The girlfriend insulted the shirt immediately upon meeting. The author felt disrespected, especially since the shirt was a gift from his wife. His reaction was to tell her to go fuck herself, which is clearly aggressive and offensive. The wife's shock and the girlfriend storming off are part of the aftermath.\n\nNow, considering social norms, when someone is rude to another person, especially in a first meeting, the appropriate response usually involves some form of polite rebuke or ignoring the comment. But the author's response was extremely harsh and confrontational. That's a red flag. Even if the girlfriend was being rude, the author's choice of words was inappropriate and would likely escalate the situation. \n\nThe shirt being a gift from his wife adds another layer. It's possible he felt the comment was personal, but that doesn't justify a hostile response. The key here is whether the reaction was proportional. Insulting someone's clothing is one thing, but telling them to go fuck themselves is a major overreaction. \n\nAlso, the context is a dinner with his wife and best friend. His actions could have ruined the evening and strained the friendship. The friend might feel embarrassed or upset with the author for causing a scene. The girlfriend's reaction (storming off) suggests she was taken aback by the author's response, which might have been unexpected and overly aggressive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, even if the girlfriend was at fault first, the author's response was not socially acceptable. People often make offhand comments, but responding with such hostility is not typical. The author could have addressed it in a more mature way, like politely disagreeing or not engaging. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his reaction was disproportionate and inappropriate, regardless of the initial insult.\n"
