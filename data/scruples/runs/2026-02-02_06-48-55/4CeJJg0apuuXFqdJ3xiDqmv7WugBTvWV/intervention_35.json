      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the story is at dinner with their wife, best friend, and the friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend criticizes the author's flannel shirt, which was a Christmas gift from his wife. The author then tells her to \"go fuck herself,\" leading to her leaving.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the immediate reaction and social norms. Insulting someone, even if they insulted you first, can be seen as a poor response in a social setting. The author's wife is present, so the reaction could cause her distress. Also, the girlfriend is the best friend's partner, so this might strain the friendship. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's initial comment was disrespectful. She looked him up and down and called his shirt hideous. That's pretty harsh. The author might feel disrespected, especially since it was a gift. But how someone responds to such a comment matters. Telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is aggressive and not a constructive response. Even if the trigger was a rude comment, the author's reaction is likely to escalate the situation rather than de-escalate it.\n\nSocially, using such a strong insult in public, especially when the person is a guest in someone else's company, is generally frowned upon. It's important to maintain composure and handle conflicts politely to avoid ruining relationships. The author's action might have been a knee-jerk reaction, but the consequences could be severe for both his friendship and his wife's feelings. \n\nSo, even though the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was inappropriate. The right approach might have been to express disapproval without being offensive, or to let the friend handle it. But by lashing out, the author likely made a mistake. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
