      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself after she called his favorite shirt hideous. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The situation is a first meeting between the author and his best friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticizes the author's shirt, which he mentions he doesn't usually like but it's his wife's Christmas gift and now his favorite. The author then responds with a harsh insult, leading the girlfriend to storm off and the friend to leave.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and expectations. When someone meets a new girlfriend, especially in a social setting like dinner, how one behaves is crucial. The author's reaction is extreme\u2014using a vulgar and aggressive response. Even if the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's reply is not appropriate. It's a public setting, and such a reaction could be seen as unkind and disrespectful, especially since he's the best friend of the person he's addressing this to.\n\nThe girlfriend's comment about the shirt being hideous might be a social faux pas, but that doesn't justify the author's response. People have different tastes, and even if someone's style isn't to your liking, calling it hideous is harsh. However, the author's reaction is disproportionate. Telling someone to go fuck themselves is a severe insult and can be considered offensive. It's likely to escalate the situation and cause embarrassment to the author, his wife, and his friend.\n\nAlso, the fact that the shirt is a gift from his wife adds another layer. The girlfriend's comment might have been an insult not just to the author but indirectly to his wife. However, the appropriate response would be to address the comment politely or let the author handle it, not to respond with such a strong vulgarity.\n\nThe author's action could damage the relationship with his best friend, especially if the girlfriend was just expressing her opinion. The friend might feel that the author took sides inappropriately or acted in a way that was unkind. Publicly humiliating the girlfriend could make the friend question the author's judgment and the value he places on his friend's new relationship.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response is more concerning. It's important to maintain respect, even in heated moments. The author's choice to use a vulgar insult suggests a lack of control and consideration for the social setting and the feelings of others involved. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
