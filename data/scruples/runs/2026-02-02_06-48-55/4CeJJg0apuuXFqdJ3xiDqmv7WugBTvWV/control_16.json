      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself.\" Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's best friend introduced his new girlfriend. She immediately criticized the author's shirt as \"hideous.\" The shirt was a Christmas gift from his wife, so he has a personal attachment to it. In response, the author told her to \"go fuck herself,\" leading to her storming off, the friend leaving, and the author questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is wrong. The key points here are the appropriateness of the response and the circumstances leading to it. The girlfriend's comment was a personal attack on the author's clothing choice. However, even if the comment was rude, responding with a curse-laden retort in a public setting, especially in front of the friend and the author's wife, was an escalation. It's important to consider social norms and the potential for de-escalation. The author could have chosen a more constructive response, like expressing discomfort about the comment and addressing it calmly. Instead, the immediate harsh reaction led to a confrontation. \n\nAdditionally, the shirt's significance as a gift from his wife adds emotional weight, but that doesn't justify an aggressive response. The situation could have been managed better. The friend might feel embarrassed, and the new girlfriend's reaction (storming off) shows that the comment had a strong impact. The author's action disrupted the social gathering and could damage relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment was also inconsiderate. But the author's response was not measured. The question is whether their reaction was in the wrong. While the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was not proportionate. In social interactions, it's generally expected to handle insults with composure to avoid unnecessary conflict. \n\nTherefore, the author is at fault for not responding calmly and for using an aggressive, disrespectful reply. Even if triggered, the way they handled it was inappropriate. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
