      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is at fault for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author met the new girlfriend, who immediately criticized his flannel shirt. He responds by telling her to go to hell, leading to her storming off and the friend leaving. The author is now wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here are social etiquette, respect, and the appropriateness of the response. The girlfriend made a direct, negative comment about the shirt. The author, instead of reacting calmly, responded with a harsh insult. \n\nNow, even if the shirt was unflattering, the immediate and public backlash might be seen as disproportionate. The girlfriend had the right to her opinion, but the author's response was not constructive. Especially since the shirt was a gift from his wife, maybe he feels more defensive about it. However, lashing out in that manner could be seen as rude and unkind.\n\nThe friend might be upset because his girlfriend was treated poorly by his best friend. The friend's reaction of leaving suggests that he values his girlfriend's feelings and is upset with the author's behavior. The wife's shock also indicates that the author's response was unexpected and socially unacceptable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author did respond in a way that escalated the situation. Even if he felt disrespected, a better approach would have been to address the comment politely or not engage at all. So, the author is likely in the wrong here (Answer A). But wait, maybe the girlfriend was being intentionally rude first. However, responding with a curse and telling her to leave isn't a socially acceptable response regardless. So yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
