      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend insulted the author's Christmas shirt, and the author told her to \"go fuck herself,\" leading to her leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The girlfriend insulted the shirt right away. The author's wife bought it, so it's his favorite. The author responded with a harsh insult, causing her to leave. The best friend was confused and followed her out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. I need to decide if the author's reaction was justified. Insulting someone's clothing is rude, but responding with a curse-laden insult is even more offensive. The author's response was direct and aggressive, which could be seen as disproportionate. Even if the girlfriend overstepped, telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is not a respectful or acceptable response in a social setting. The author's wife was present, so their reaction could affect the relationship with the best friend and spouse.\n\nSo, the author's reaction was inappropriate. The initial insult was rude, but the response was even worse. The author's actions led to the guest leaving, causing tension. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
