      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is that the author went to dinner with their wife, best friend, and the friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticized the author's shirt as \"hideous,\" which the author's wife had given them for Christmas. The author then told the girlfriend to \"go fuck herself,\" leading to her storming off and the friend leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. When someone meets someone else's friend, it's generally expected to be polite and respectful. The girlfriend's comment about the shirt was a direct insult. The author's response was to insult her back in a very harsh way. Even if the shirt was unflattering, responding with such a strong insult is probably not appropriate. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions they're not a fan of flannels, so maybe they were already self-conscious. The girlfriend's comment was a personal jab, and the author felt disrespected. However, the way they responded was aggressive and could be seen as uncontrolled. Even if the girlfriend was rude, the author's reaction might have been disproportionate. \n\nIn social interactions, it's important to maintain composure. The author's wife was present, which adds another layer. The wife's reaction (shock) suggests that she didn't expect the author to respond so angrily. The friend might feel embarrassed or upset because his girlfriend caused a scene and then left. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend started with an insult, but the author's response was to escalate the situation. While the girlfriend was rude, the author's reaction was not measured. A better response might have been to express discomfort or disapproval in a calmer manner, rather than a direct insult. \n\nSo, even if the girlfriend was the initial aggressor, the author's choice to retaliate with such a strong curse word and send her away might be seen as the asshole move. The author could be seen as overreacting, which led to the conflict. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (Answer A). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The shirt was a gift, so maybe the author felt it was more personal. Still, the response was harsh. Yeah, I think AITA would say the author is an asshole because they escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n"
