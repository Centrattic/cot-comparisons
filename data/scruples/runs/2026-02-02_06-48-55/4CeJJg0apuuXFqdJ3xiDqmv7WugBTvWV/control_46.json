      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, the author went to dinner with his wife and best friend to meet the friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately called the author's shirt \"hideous.\" The author, who already isn't a fan of flannels, was wearing a shirt his wife bought him for Christmas, which he now considers his favorite. The author then told the girlfriend to \"go fuck herself,\" she left, and the friend followed. Now he's asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. When meeting someone for the first time, especially in a social setting with friends and family, it's expected to be polite and respectful, even if there's an immediate dislike. The girlfriend made a comment about the shirt, which could be seen as rude, but reacting by telling someone to \"go fuck yourself\" is definitely aggressive and not acceptable.\n\nThe author's actions led to the girlfriend storming off and the friend leaving, which suggests a significant disruption. The wife's shocked reaction also indicates that the author's response was unexpected and possibly hurtful. Even if the girlfriend was rude first, the author's response was disproportionate. There are more appropriate ways to handle an insult, such as responding calmly or ignoring it, rather than using a harsh insult.\n\nMoreover, the shirt was a gift from the wife, which might have added emotional value. But that's not an excuse for the author's reaction. The key issue here is the immediate and aggressive response. People should handle conflicts with more restraint, especially in social settings where others are present. The author's action could have been a major embarrassment for his wife and friend, and it's unlikely to resolve any conflict or improve the situation. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
