Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author met his best friend's new girlfriend for the first time. The girlfriend immediately criticized his flannel shirt, which he actually likes because his wife got it for him. He responded by telling her to \"go fuck herself,\" which caused her to leave, and then his friend followed her out. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider social norms. When meeting someone new, especially in a group, making a comment about someone's appearance can be offensive. But the girlfriend was the one who made the first negative comment. However, the author's response was extremely harsh and confrontational. \n\nEven if the girlfriend's comment was rude, responding with a curse-laden remark like \"go fuck herself\" is aggressive and not appropriate in a polite social setting. The author could have handled it better, maybe by politely disagreeing or not engaging. Instead, he escalated the situation, leading to the girl and his friend leaving. \n\nAlso, considering that this was a first meeting, the girl might have been trying to make an impression, but her comment was out of line. However, the author's response was even worse. It's important to note that the author's wife was there, and he might have made her uncomfortable too. \n\nI think the key here is that while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's reaction was disproportionate and unkind. People should be able to handle criticism without responding with such hostility, especially in a social setting where it's important to maintain harmony. \n\nSo even though the girlfriend started it, the author's reaction was not appropriate. Therefore, he is at least partially at fault here. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
