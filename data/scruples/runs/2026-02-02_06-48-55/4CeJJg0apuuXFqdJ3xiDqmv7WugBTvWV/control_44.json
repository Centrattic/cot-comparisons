      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation is that the girl criticized the author's shirt, which his wife gave him, and then he responded with an insult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is definitely a strong and offensive response. Even if the girl was rude, reacting that way is probably not appropriate. The author might have been upset because the shirt was a gift from his wife, which adds emotional value. But does that justify such a harsh reply?\n\nAlso, the context is a first meeting between friends and their partners. The girl's comment about the shirt was immediate and negative, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author's reaction caused the girl to leave, which might have strained the friendship. Even if the girl was rude, the author's response could escalate the situation unnecessarily.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girl was out of line by making a judgment about his clothing so quickly. But public shaming or insults aren't the way to handle it. The author's wife might be embarrassed, and the best friend would likely be upset by the confrontation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reaction, while understandable given the emotional attachment to the shirt, was inappropriate. It's important to address disrespect without resorting to insults. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
