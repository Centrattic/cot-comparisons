      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend insulted his shirt, which he really likes, and he responded by telling her to go fuck herself. The girlfriend then left, and the best friend followed. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend insulted him immediately after meeting him, which could be seen as rude. However, the appropriate response to an insult depends on the situation. Telling someone to go fuck themselves is a strong, aggressive reply, which is generally considered disrespectful and can be seen as offensive, regardless of the provocation.\n\nThe author's wife was present and shocked, which indicates that the response was unexpected and possibly over the top in front of others. Even if the shirt was a gift and he values it, responding with a harsh insult isn't a socially acceptable way to handle the situation. There are more constructive ways to address an insult, like calmly expressing that the comment was rude and asking them to be respectful.\n\nThe girlfriend's comment might have been a personal opinion, but that doesn't justify a hostile response. The key here is whether the author's reaction was proportionate and respectful. Since the response was a direct insult, it's likely that the author overreacted. The best friend and his girlfriend leaving suggests that the situation was uncomfortable and the author's response may have damaged the budding relationship or at least caused immediate conflict.\n\nIn social norms, even if someone says something you disagree with, responding with a vulgar insult is inappropriate. The author's action could be seen as contributing to the conflict rather than resolving it. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
