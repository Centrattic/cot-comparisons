      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" after she criticized his shirt. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's wife bought him a flannel shirt, which he doesn't usually like but it's his favorite now. The new girlfriend comments that the shirt is hideous. The author responds with a harsh insult, leading the girlfriend to storm off, and the friend leaves.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend made a derogatory comment about his clothing. The author's reaction was to tell her to \"go fuck herself,\" which is definitely a rude and aggressive response. Even if the comment was harsh, responding in that way is not appropriate, especially in a social setting where he's meeting someone for the first time.\n\nConsidering the context, the author could have handled it more diplomatically. Maybe by brushing it off or not responding in kind. The fact that the wife bought the shirt might add some personal value to it, but that doesn't justify the insult. The author's reaction caused the situation to escalate and led to an uncomfortable departure. \n\nTherefore, the author's response was inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
