      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author meets his best friend's new girlfriend for the first time. The girlfriend immediately criticizes his flannel shirt, saying it's \"hideous.\" The author, who admits he doesn't like flannels but this one was a gift from his wife, takes offense and tells her to \"go fuck herself.\" The girlfriend leaves, the friend is confused, and they all leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. When meeting someone's partner for the first time, it's important to be polite and respectful. The girlfriend made a comment that was probably meant to be a joke or a light-hearted jab, but it came off as rude. However, the author's response of telling her to \"go fuck herself\" is definitely aggressive and inappropriate, especially in a public setting where there are other people present, like his wife and best friend.\n\nEven if the shirt comment was a bit presumptuous, the author's reaction escalated the situation. Telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is a strong insult that's not suitable for any polite conversation, let alone a first meeting. The author's wife being present adds another layer because it might have been embarrassing for her, especially since the shirt was a gift from her. The author's action could have caused discomfort and possibly damaged the relationship with his best friend, depending on how the friend perceives the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment about the shirt was also unkind. The author might have felt disrespected, but reacting with such a harsh insult is not the right way to handle it. The appropriate response would have been to either ignore the comment, respond politely, or address it with humor. The author's reaction was impulsive and disrespectful, which is why he's the one at fault here. The girlfriend's comment was rude, but the author's response was even more so. So, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
