      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation is that the girlfriend called the author's shirt hideous, and the author responded with an insult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriateness. In most contexts, telling someone to \"go fuck yourself\" is a very harsh and offensive response, regardless of the provocation. It's a direct insult that can be seen as rude and disrespectful. Even if the shirt comment was a slight, responding with such a strong retort is generally considered inconsiderate and could escalate the situation.\n\nThe author's wife is present, and she shows shock, which indicates that the response was unexpected and possibly inappropriate. The girlfriend's comment about the shirt might have been a personal opinion, but the author's reaction was disproportionate. The fact that the shirt was a Christmas gift from his wife adds a layer, but it doesn't justify an aggressive response.\n\nAlso, the outcome was that the girlfriend left, which suggests that the author's reaction caused the conflict. The best friend might have been confused, as the situation escalated quickly. In most social situations, maintaining respect and composure is expected, even if someone is rude. Retaliation with a harsh insult typically leads to being seen as the one in the wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's response was inappropriate, regardless of the initial comment. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
