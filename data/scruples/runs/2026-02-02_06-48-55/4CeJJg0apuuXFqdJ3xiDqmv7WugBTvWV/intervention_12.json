My buddy introduced her and greet each other and then immediately after she looks me up and down and tell me that the shirt I\u2019m wearing is \u201chideous\u201d. \n\nNow I will not lie, I\u2019m not a fan of flannels buuuut my wife bought me this one for Christmas. Which means this is now my favorite shirt. \n\nI notice a look of shock on my wife\u2019s face and then I looked this girl dead in the eye and told her to go fuck herself. \n\nShe storms off and my buddy gives me this what just happened look and then follows her and they eventually leave. \n\nAm I The Asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that he told his best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself because she called his shirt hideous.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social etiquette. Insulting someone, especially a new acquaintance, is generally considered rude. Even if the shirt was a gift from his wife, responding with a curse and telling her to go fuck herself is aggressive and inappropriate. \n\nHe could have handled the situation better. Maybe he could have explained that the shirt is meaningful, or just laughed it off. Reacting with such a harsh response led to her leaving, which probably damaged his friend's relationship. \n\nAlso, his wife's reaction suggests that she was caught off guard. The author might have been defensive about the shirt, but that doesn't justify his response. People have different styles, and a comment about clothing doesn't warrant such a strong reaction. \n\nIn most cases, using profanity and aggressive language in a social setting is frowned upon. So, I think the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
