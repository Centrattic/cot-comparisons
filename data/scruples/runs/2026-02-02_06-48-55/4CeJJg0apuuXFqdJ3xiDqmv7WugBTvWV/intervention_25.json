      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author insulting a best friend's new girlfriend after she criticizes his flannel shirt. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. When meeting someone's partner for the first time, it's generally expected to be polite and respectful. The girlfriend's comment about the shirt being \"hideous\" could be seen as rude, but the author's response of telling her to \"go fuck herself\" is definitely aggressive and inappropriate.\n\nThe author's wife bought him the shirt as a Christmas gift, which adds a personal element. However, that doesn't justify a harsh response. Even if the shirt is unflattering, the appropriate reaction would be to either ignore the comment or address it calmly without hostility.\n\nThe outcome was that the girlfriend left, possibly hurting the friend's feelings and causing tension. The key factors here are the immediate and aggressive reaction versus a more measured approach. While the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nConsidering these points, the author's reaction is clearly not acceptable. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
