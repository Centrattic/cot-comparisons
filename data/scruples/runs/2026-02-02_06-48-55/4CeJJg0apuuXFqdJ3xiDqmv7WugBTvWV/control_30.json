      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend insulted his shirt, which his wife bought him, and he responded by telling her to go fuck herself. The girlfriend left, and the friend followed. The question is whether the author is an asshole (ITA) or not.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The girlfriend made a direct insult about his shirt. He was wearing a flannel, which he's not a fan of, but his wife bought it. He took it as a gift, so maybe he felt it was important to her. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as rude and inconsiderate, especially in a first meeting. The author's response was to tell her to go fuck herself, which is definitely harsh and confrontational. \n\nNow, considering social norms and etiquette: when someone makes a rude comment, the appropriate response might be to express that it's not appreciated, but yelling a curse-laden response is extreme. The author could have handled it more diplomatically, perhaps by addressing the issue privately with his friend later instead of confronting the girlfriend publicly. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend was a guest in the friend's home (or at least part of a dinner), and the author's reaction might have made the friend uncomfortable. The friend might feel that his new girlfriend's behavior was unkind, but the author's response was equally problematic. \n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend insulted the author's clothing, the author's wife was present and shocked, and the author reacted in a way that led to the girlfriend leaving. The author's action could be seen as overreacting, even if the girlfriend was rude. However, the girlfriend's initial comment was also inappropriate. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In most social situations, responding with a curse like that is considered unacceptable, regardless of the provocation. So the author's action is the main issue here. Even if the girlfriend was rude, the author's response was disproportionate and could be considered the asshole behavior. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong). However, I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. For example, maybe the girlfriend's comment was part of a pattern of behavior, but the story only mentions that single instance. The author's wife's reaction also suggests that he might have overstepped, as she was shocked. The friend's reaction (\"what just happened\") indicates that the author's response was unexpected and possibly too harsh. \n\nTherefore, the author's response was inappropriate, making him the asshole. So the answer is A.\n"
