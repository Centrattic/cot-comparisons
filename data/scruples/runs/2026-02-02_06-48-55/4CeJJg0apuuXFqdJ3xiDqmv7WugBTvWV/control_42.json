      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, while at dinner with his wife and best friend, met his friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticized his flannel shirt as \"hideous,\" so he responded by telling her to go fuck herself. She left, the friend was shocked, followed her, and they left. The author is now wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and appropriateness of the response. The key points are: the girlfriend made a comment about his shirt, he reacted aggressively, and it led to the breakup of the dinner and the departure of the friend and his girlfriend. \n\nThe author's defense is that the shirt was a gift from his wife and he's not a fan of flannel, but he chose to wear it. The girlfriend's comment was direct and possibly rude, but the author's response of \"go fuck yourself\" is certainly harsh and offensive. \n\nIn social situations, especially when meeting someone's partner for the first time, maintaining politeness is important. Even if the comment was hurtful, responding with such aggression could be seen as unprofessional and disrespectful. The author's reaction escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nHowever, there's the argument that the girlfriend's comment was the initial provocation. But even so, the appropriate response would be to address it calmly, maybe with a joke or a polite counter-comment, not a direct insult. The author's friend might have been taken aback not just by the reaction, but by how quickly things escalated. \n\nAlso, considering the context: the author was with his wife, and the friend's girlfriend made a comment that could be seen as dismissive or rude. The author's reaction might have been influenced by the fact that the shirt was a gift, adding emotional value. But regardless, the response was inappropriate. \n\nIn many social norms, responding to an insult with another insult is not acceptable, especially in a public setting and in front of one's spouse. The author's action likely caused embarrassment to his wife and could have damaged the friendship with his friend. \n\nTherefore, the consensus would likely be that the author is in the wrong for overreacting. Even if the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author didn't have to respond in such a hostile manner. There are better ways to handle such situations without escalating to a point of confrontation. So the answer is A.\n"
