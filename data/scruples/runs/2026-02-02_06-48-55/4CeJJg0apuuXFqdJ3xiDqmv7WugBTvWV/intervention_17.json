      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" after she criticizes his shirt. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman made a comment about his shirt being hideous, which he didn't like because it was a gift from his wife. Then he responded with a harsh insult, leading to her leaving. The key points here are the immediate reaction and the appropriateness of his response.\n\nIn social interactions, respect and civility are usually expected. Even if someone makes a rude comment, responding with a curse-laden insult is generally considered inappropriate. It's important to assess whether the author's reaction was proportionate. The girlfriend's comment was offensive, but the author's response was even more so, especially in a setting where he was meeting someone's friend. \n\nAlso, considering that it was a first meeting and the girlfriend's comment might have been an attempt at humor or a personal opinion, the author's reaction likely escalated the situation unnecessarily. The fact that his wife was present and shocked adds another layer, suggesting that the response was unexpected and possibly hurtful to her.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the best friend. The friend might have been embarrassed or upset that his girlfriend was so rude to his close friend. The author's reaction could have damaged the friend's relationship with both his girlfriend and the author. \n\nIn most social norms, responding to an insult with a stronger insult is not considered acceptable behavior. People are generally expected to handle such situations with composure, even if it's challenging. The author's choice to use a vulgar phrase in a public setting, especially when the girlfriend was a guest, is likely seen as rude and unprofessional.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's response was disproportionate and unkind. While the girlfriend's comment was unkind, the author's reaction went too far. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
