      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend insulted his shirt, which he really liked because his wife got it for him. He responded by telling her to go fuck herself, leading to her leaving and the friend following.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author's response was appropriate. The key points here are: the girlfriend made a comment about his shirt being hideous. The author, who isn't a fan of flannels but this one was a gift from his wife, took it as an insult. He then told her to go fuck herself, which is a very harsh and rude response.\n\nIn social interactions, especially when meeting someone for the first time, there's an expectation of politeness and respect. The girlfriend's comment was probably a personal opinion, not a direct attack. However, even if it was slightly rude, the author's reaction seems excessive. Using a curse phrase like that is unprofessional and could be seen as aggressive. \n\nThe shirt's significance as a gift from his wife might have added to his emotional response, but that doesn't justify the language he used. It's important to consider how such a response affects others. The girlfriend storming off and the friend leaving suggests that the author's actions damaged the social situation and possibly the budding relationship between his friend and the girlfriend. \n\nAlso, the author's wife was present and shocked, indicating that his reaction might have been unexpected and hurtful to her as well. The immediate reaction without trying to de-escalate the situation (like calmly responding or addressing the issue privately) shows poor conflict resolution skills. \n\nIn most social norms, responding to a personal opinion with a curse is not acceptable. Even if the comment was unkind, a better approach would be to express discomfort or explain the significance of the shirt without being aggressive. The author's reaction could be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend and unhelpful in maintaining a positive interaction. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's response was in the wrong because he escalated a minor conflict with an inappropriate and rude remark, leading to negative consequences for everyone involved.\n"
