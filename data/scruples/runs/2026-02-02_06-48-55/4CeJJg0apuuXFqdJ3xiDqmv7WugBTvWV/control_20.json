      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author told their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself after she criticized his shirt. The shirt was a gift from his wife, and he's not a fan of flannels but this one is his favorite.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. Insulting someone, even if they insulted you first, is usually seen as rude. The girl called his shirt hideous, which might have been a bit harsh, but responding with a swear word and telling her to go fuck herself is definitely aggressive. \n\nThen there's the context of meeting someone new. The author is meeting his best friend's new girlfriend, so there's an expectation of being polite. The girl's comment was probably meant to be a bit of a joke or a test, but the author overreacted. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is mentioned. She was shocked, which suggests that the author's response was unexpected and possibly hurtful. The best friend's reaction of confusion shows that the author's behavior was inappropriate in front of his friend.\n\nBut maybe there's some nuance. The shirt was a gift from his wife, so he might have felt defensive. The girl's comment could have been a way to test the author's character, but that's speculative. Regardless, the author's response was not measured. \n\nIn social situations, it's generally expected to handle insults with composure. Even if someone is rude, responding with a swear word and causing a scene is not considered acceptable behavior. The author's actions led to the girlfriend leaving, which could damage his friendship if the friend takes her side. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's reaction was out of line. He should have handled the situation more politely, maybe by making a joke or changing the subject. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
