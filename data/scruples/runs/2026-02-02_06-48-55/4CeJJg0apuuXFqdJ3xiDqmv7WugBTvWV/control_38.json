      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person's best friend's new girlfriend called his shirt \"hideous,\" and he told her to go fuck herself. Then she left, and the friend followed. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations. When meeting someone for the first time, especially through a friend, there's an expectation of politeness. The girlfriend made a comment about his shirt, which he didn't like. He responded with a harsh insult. That seems pretty direct and confrontational. Even if the shirt was something he was attached to (since his wife bought it), responding with such a strong insult might be seen as inappropriate.\n\nBut then again, people can have different thresholds for what they consider rude. The girlfriend's comment might have been a bit out of line too, but making a snarky comment in an introduction isn't ideal. However, the author's response was even more extreme. Telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is a severe reaction and could be seen as unprovoked aggression, especially in a situation where the goal is to meet someone for the first time.\n\nAlso, the author is in a sensitive position as the best friend. The new girlfriend is his friend's partner, so he has to be careful not to overstep. His reaction might have ruined their friend's chance to get to know his girlfriend, which could strain the friendship. The wife's shocked reaction also suggests that his response was unexpected and maybe not socially acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment was perhaps a bit rude, and the author might have felt disrespected. But instead of handling it calmly, he escalated the situation. There's a difference between standing up for yourself and being rude. Maybe he could have responded with a joke or a light-hearted comment instead of an outright insult.\n\nIn most social contexts, responding with a curse in such a scenario is considered rude. The author's action might be seen as the asshole move because he took a personal and harsh reaction, leading to the girlfriend leaving and the friend probably being upset. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
