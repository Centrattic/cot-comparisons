      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation is that the girlfriend called his shirt hideous, and he responded by telling her to go fuck herself.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author was in a social setting, meeting his best friend's new girlfriend for the first time. The girlfriend insulted his shirt, which was a gift from his wife. He then responded with a harsh insult, leading to her leaving and the friend following her. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The author was in a situation where he met his friend's girlfriend, 2) The girlfriend made a comment about his shirt, 3) He responded with a curse-laced insult, 4) The girlfriend left, and the friend left as well.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's comment: she said the shirt was hideous. While it's an insult, maybe it's a minor one. However, in social situations, especially when meeting someone's partner, it's expected to be polite. But the author's response was to tell her to go fuck herself. That's a very strong reaction. \n\nNow, the author's shirt was a gift from his wife. He mentions he's not a fan of flannels, but the wife bought it for Christmas, making it his favorite. So the shirt has sentimental value. The girlfriend's comment might have been a personal slight to both him and his wife, especially since it was a gift. The wife's shocked reaction suggests she was taken aback by the girlfriend's comment as well. \n\nBut even so, the author's response was to immediately tell her to go fuck herself. That's a very aggressive and inappropriate response. In a first meeting, especially when trying to make a good impression, responding with such hostility would be seen as the problem. The girlfriend's comment, while rude, might have been a personal opinion, but the author escalated it into a conflict. \n\nSocial norms typically dictate that even if someone insults you, you respond politely, especially in a new friend's presence. The author's reaction could be seen as disproportionate. Even if the shirt was important, the immediate use of a curse phrase and telling someone to leave is not acceptable in most social circles. \n\nAdditionally, the consequences: the girlfriend storms off, the friend leaves, and the situation is ruined. The author's actions directly caused the fallout. The friend might be upset with the author for causing the girl to leave, which could strain the friendship. \n\nHowever, there's a possible defense: maybe the girlfriend's comment was intended as a test or a way to see how the author would react. If the author's friend's girlfriend was trying to provoke him, then his response might have been predictable. But that's speculative. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: society generally expects people to handle insults with grace, unless there's a history of abuse or something. Here, it's a one-time comment. The author's reaction is over the top. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a cultural context? In some subcultures, being blunt is okay, but in most, especially in mixed company, it's not. Also, the presence of his wife might mean that the girlfriend's comment was a slight against the wife's gift. So maybe the author felt it was a direct attack on his wife, which could justify some reaction. However, telling someone to go fuck herself is still excessive. \n\nSo even if the comment was rude, the response was worse. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
