      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user went to dinner with his wife and best friend to meet his friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticized the shirt the user was wearing, calling it \"hideous.\" The shirt was a gift from his wife, so he likes it now. The user then told her to \"go fuck himself,\" which caused her to leave, and the friend followed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The girlfriend made a rude comment about the shirt right away. The user was put on the spot, and his response was to tell her to go fuck herself. That's a very aggressive and disrespectful reply. Even if the comment was unkind, responding with a curse is likely to escalate the situation. \n\nThe user's wife is present, and she probably felt embarrassed or shocked by his reaction. The friend's girlfriend's comment was inappropriate, but does that justify the user's response? While the comment was rude, it's possible the user overreacted. People might have different opinions on fashion, and a gift from a spouse is something personal. However, calling someone a derogatory name in public is not a mature response.\n\nIn social interactions, it's generally expected to handle conflicts calmly, even if the other person is rude. The user's action led to the girlfriend leaving, which might have damaged the friend's relationship. The friend's reaction (\"what just happened look\") suggests that the friend was also taken aback by the user's behavior.\n\nSo, the user's response was not proportionate to the initial comment. There's no indication that the girlfriend made any other offensive remarks beyond the comment about the shirt. The user's choice to respond with a curse word was unprofessional and disrespectful, even if the girlfriend was rude. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not handling the situation more calmly and for using a hurtful response.\n"
