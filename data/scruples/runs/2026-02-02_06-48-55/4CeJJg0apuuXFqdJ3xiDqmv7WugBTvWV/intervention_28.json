      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, along with his wife, met his best friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately criticized the author's flannel shirt as \"hideous,\" leading the author to tell her to \"go fuck herself.\" The girlfriend left, and the friend followed. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's reaction was appropriate. The girlfriend made a negative comment about his shirt. While it's true that people can have different tastes, making a direct and possibly insulting remark in the first meeting isn't great. However, the author's response was to tell her to \"go fuck herself,\" which is clearly aggressive and rude. \n\nEven if the girlfriend was rude first, responding with such a strong insult is not a mature way to handle the situation. The author should have considered the context\u2014his friend's new girlfriend, a dinner with his wife. His reaction likely escalated the situation unnecessarily. The wife's shocked reaction suggests that this was unexpected and perhaps inappropriate. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. The girlfriend's comment was a personal opinion, and while it was unkind, the author's response was a hostile reaction that led to her leaving. The author could have chosen to ignore the comment or address it calmly, but instead, he reacted impulsively, which probably caused more harm. \n\nIn social interactions, especially in a group setting where there are other people involved (like his wife and his friend), maintaining composure is important. The author's action might have embarrassed his wife, upset his friend, and created an awkward situation. So, yes, the author is in the wrong because his response was excessive and unprofessional, even if the initial comment was rude. It's about how one handles conflict and respect in such situations.\n"
