      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author and their wife went to dinner with their best friend to meet his new girlfriend for the first time. The girlfriend immediately criticizes the author's shirt, calling it \"hideous.\" The author then tells her to go \"fuck herself,\" which leads to her storming off, and the friend and girlfriend leaving.\n\nFirst, I should consider social norms and etiquette. When meeting someone for the first time, especially in a social setting like a dinner with friends and family, it's generally expected to be polite and respectful. The girlfriend made a comment about the author's clothing choice, which could be seen as rude or impolite. However, responding with a profane and aggressive retort would likely escalate the situation and is not considered appropriate behavior.\n\nThe author mentions that the shirt was a Christmas gift from his wife, which he now considers his favorite. This adds a personal element, as the girlfriend's comment might have been perceived as a personal attack on the author's wife's taste. The author's reaction was immediate and intense, which might have been driven by both the direct criticism and the implication of his wife's choice being \"hideous.\"\n\nBut the key question is whether the author's response was in the wrong. Even if the girlfriend's comment was rude, responding with a curse-laced remark is not a socially acceptable way to handle it. The author could have addressed the comment in a more measured way, perhaps by expressing that the comment was unwelcome without being offensive. By reacting so harshly, the author likely caused the situation to deteriorate quickly, leading to the girlfriend leaving and the friend being confused.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The girlfriend was the first to act rudely, so maybe the author was just defending himself. However, in social interactions, it's generally expected to maintain composure even when faced with rudeness. The author's response, while perhaps a reaction to feeling disrespected, was also disrespectful and contributed to the conflict.\n\nAnother angle: The author's wife's presence might have added pressure. The author might have been trying to defend his wife's choice, but in doing so, he escalated the situation. The wife's shocked reaction suggests that even she was taken aback by his response, indicating that it was unexpected and possibly inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was equally inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
