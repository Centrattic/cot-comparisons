      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The setup is that the girlfriend insulted his shirt, which his wife bought as a gift. He then responded with a harsh comment, leading to her leaving and the friend following.\n\nFirst, the context matters. The girlfriend made a negative comment about his shirt. He might feel disrespected, especially since the shirt was a gift from his wife. But reacting with \"go fuck yourself\" seems extreme. Even if he's upset, that kind of language is confrontational and could be seen as rude.\n\nThen there's the social situation. They were meeting the girlfriend for the first time. His reaction could have caused embarrassment for his friend and wife. The girlfriend's immediate reaction was to storm off, which might indicate that his response was uninvited and harsh. But he might argue that he felt disrespected and acted on impulse.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. In most social contexts, responding to an insult with a profane retort is not considered appropriate. Even if the shirt was a gift, the way he handled the situation could be seen as immature or disrespectful. His friend's confusion and the girlfriend's storming out suggest that the situation escalated unnecessarily. So, the author's reaction was probably inconsiderate of the social setting and the relationships involved. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
