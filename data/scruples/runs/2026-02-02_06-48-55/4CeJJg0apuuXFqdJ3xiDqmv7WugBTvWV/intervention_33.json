      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend criticized his shirt, which his wife bought him, and he responded with a harsh insult, leading to the girlfriend leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriate behavior. The author was in a social setting with his wife, best friend, and the girlfriend. The girlfriend made a comment about his shirt, which he found offensive. His reaction was to tell her to \"go fuck herself,\" which is definitely a strong and rude response. \n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend's comment was immediate after meeting, which might come off as rude or disrespectful. The author's reaction was not measured; he didn't take a moment to think or respond calmly. His wife's reaction was shock, indicating that his response was unexpected and inappropriate. \n\nEven though the shirt was a gift from his wife, the appropriate reaction would be to either ignore the comment, respond politely, or perhaps discuss it privately. Yelling an insult in public is unlikely to be seen as acceptable, especially in front of his wife and best friend. The girlfriend's comment might have been a personal opinion, but the author's response escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nAlso, considering the context of a first meeting, such a reaction could be damaging to the relationship between the best friend and his girlfriend. The author might have overreacted, prioritizing his feelings about the shirt over maintaining a respectful interaction. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's response was not appropriate. He should have handled the situation more maturely. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
