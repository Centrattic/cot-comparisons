      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself after she called his shirt hideous. The shirt was a gift from his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The guy was with his wife and best friend meeting the new girlfriend. The girlfriend insulted his shirt right away. He responded with an insult, which caused her to leave. The question is whether he was wrong.\n\nSo, what's the norm here? Generally, being rude or using offensive language in social situations is considered wrong. Even if someone insults another, responding with a harsh insult isn't typically seen as appropriate. However, there might be arguments about defending oneself or the value of the shirt being a gift. \n\nThe key points: The author was in a social setting with his wife and friend. The girlfriend made a comment about his shirt. He responded with a strong insult. The result was her leaving and the friend following her. \n\nPossible angles: The author's right to feel disrespected and react, but the method of response was extreme. The girlfriend's comment was rude, but the author's response escalated the situation. Social norms usually encourage de-escalation or ignoring minor insults in such settings. \n\nAlso, the fact that the shirt was a gift from his wife might add to his emotional response, but that doesn't justify a rude reply. The author's action likely hurt his friend's feelings and possibly damaged the relationship with the girlfriend. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit, the community often looks at who acted unreasonably. In this case, while the girl's comment was rude, the author's response was even more offensive. So the author is more likely to be in the wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that the girlfriend was in the wrong for the initial insult. However, the appropriate response would be to address the issue calmly, not retaliate. So the author's reaction crosses the line into being an asshole. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
