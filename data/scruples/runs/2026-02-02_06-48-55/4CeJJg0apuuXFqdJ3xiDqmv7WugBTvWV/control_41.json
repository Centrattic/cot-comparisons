      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is: The author, their wife, and their best friend met the girlfriend for the first time. The girlfriend immediately criticized the author's shirt as hideous. The author, who isn't a fan of flannels but this one was a Christmas gift from his wife, responded by telling her to go fuck herself. The girlfriend left, and the friend followed. The question is whether the author is an asshole (ITA) or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriateness. Publicly insulting someone, especially a guest, is generally considered rude. The author's reaction was very direct and aggressive. Even if the girlfriend was rude first, responding with a curse and telling her to leave is likely over the top. \n\nThen there's the context of the relationship. The author is the best friend of the guy, so their reaction might be seen as defending his friend's honor. However, the immediate and harsh response could have been unnecessary. The girlfriend was the new partner, so maybe she was just being assertive. But that doesn't excuse the author's response.\n\nAlso, the shirt was a gift from his wife, which adds emotional value. The girlfriend's comment might have been a provocation, but reacting with such intensity could have been uncontrolled. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's usually better to address such situations calmly. Telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is not only rude but could also damage relationships. The author's action might have been a justified reaction to a personal attack, but it's still a harsh one. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's response was inappropriate. Even if the girlfriend was rude, the author escalated the situation unnecessarily. The correct answer is A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
