      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" is in the wrong. The scenario is that the girlfriend insulted the author's shirt, which the wife bought, and the author responded with a harsh retort, leading the girlfriend to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions taken. The girlfriend's comment about the shirt being \"hideous\" was a direct insult. The author's response was to tell her to \"go fuck herself,\" which is a strong and offensive retort. Even if the shirt was a gift from the wife, the way the girlfriend delivered the comment might have been rude. However, responding with a vulgar phrase is not appropriate, regardless of the provocation. \n\nThe key points here are respect and proportionality. In social interactions, especially when meeting someone's partner for the first time, maintaining composure is important. The girlfriend's insult could be seen as dismissive, but the author's response escalated the situation unnecessarily. The fact that the girlfriend left immediately suggests that the response was indeed too harsh. \n\nAdditionally, the author's wife's shocked reaction indicates that the response was unexpected and socially inappropriate. The author's best friend might also face the consequences of this incident, possibly hurting the relationship between the friend and his partner. \n\nWhile the girlfriend was rude, the author's reaction was not a measured response. In such situations, it's better to address the issue calmly or let it go rather than respond with aggression. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation more respectfully.\n"
