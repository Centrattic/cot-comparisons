      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation starts with them meeting the girlfriend for the first time. The girlfriend comments on the shirt the author is wearing, which he's not a fan of flannels but it's his wife's Christmas gift. He responds with a harsh comment, leading her to storm off and the friend leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. When meeting someone new, especially a partner's significant other, it's important to be polite. The girlfriend's comment was rude and dismissive, but the author's response was even more so. Telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is a strong and offensive reply, which is clearly inappropriate in any social setting. Even if the shirt was a gift and he was attached to it, reacting with such hostility is not the right approach. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend did make a direct insult about his clothing. But people can be rude for various reasons, and the appropriate response is usually to address it calmly, not with a vulgar retort. The author's reaction escalated the situation immediately, causing the girlfriend to leave and the friend to follow. This could damage the friendship, which is a significant consequence. \n\nThe wife's shock also indicates that the response was unexpected and possibly shocking. The author's action was impulsive and didn't consider the broader implications on his friendship and possibly his wife's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's initial comment was also inconsiderate. But even if someone is rude to you, responding with equal or more rudeness isn't acceptable. The author didn't have to take it lying down, but there are better ways to handle such a situation, like calmly expressing discomfort or ignoring the comment. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend was wrong to insult him, the author's response was definitely inappropriate. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
