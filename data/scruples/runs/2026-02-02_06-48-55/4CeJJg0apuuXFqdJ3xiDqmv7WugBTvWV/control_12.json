      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself after she criticized his shirt. The shirt was a gift from his wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriateness. Insulting someone, even if they first insult you, can be seen as rude. The girlfriend made a comment about his shirt, which he found offensive. But responding with a curse and telling her to go fuck herself is pretty harsh. Even if the shirt was a gift, the immediate reaction might be over the top. \n\nThe key points here are the context and the reaction. The girlfriend's comment was a personal insult, but the author's response was even more confrontational. In social interactions, it's generally considered better to handle such situations with calmness rather than escalating them. The fact that the author's wife was present and shocked adds another layer. The response could have embarrassed her and ruined the dinner. \n\nThe author's best friend might have been caught off guard by the outburst, leading to the girlfriend leaving. The author might have overreacted, especially since the shirt being a gift is a personal matter, but the reaction doesn't seem proportionate. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if someone is disrespectful to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. But in this case, the girlfriend was a guest, and the author is the host. The way he handled it could be seen as unprofessional and inconsiderate. The immediate consequence was her storming off and leaving, which indicates a significant social faux pas. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's response was inappropriate and inconsiderate. He could have addressed the comment differently, perhaps with a witty remark or by explaining the significance of the shirt. His reaction likely caused more harm than necessary. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong.\n"
