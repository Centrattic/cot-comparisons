      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again. The author was at dinner with his wife and best friend to meet his friend's new girlfriend. The girlfriend immediately called his flannel shirt \"hideous,\" and he responded by telling her to go fuck herself. She left, the friend was shocked, followed her, and they both left.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if that's the case. First, the context: flannel shirts are a fashion choice that some people like. The author's wife bought him the shirt for Christmas, so it's a gift and holds some sentimental value. The girlfriend's comment was direct and possibly rude, but the author's response was even more aggressive. \n\nIn social interactions, especially when meeting someone for the first time, it's important to maintain a level of politeness. The girlfriend made a negative comment about his clothing, which could be seen as impolite, but how should one respond? The author's choice of words is very harsh and unprofessional. Even if the comment was offensive, responding with a curse and a threat is not acceptable. It's a hostile reaction that can damage relationships, even if the trigger was a rude comment.\n\nThe author is a guest in the friend's event and should respect the boundaries. His wife was present too, which might have compounded the awkwardness. The girlfriend might have felt insecure or had an off moment, but that's no excuse for the author's response. He could have handled it differently, like politely disagreeing or not reacting at all. His action led to the girlfriend leaving, which is a direct consequence of his words.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author overreacted. Telling someone to \"go fuck herself\" is inappropriate and likely to escalate tensions. Even if the girlfriend's comment was harsh, the author's response is not justified. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
