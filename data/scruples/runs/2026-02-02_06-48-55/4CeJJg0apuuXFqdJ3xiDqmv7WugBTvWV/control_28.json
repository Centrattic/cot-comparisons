      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation involves a dinner where the girlfriend criticizes his shirt, which his wife bought him. He responds with a harsh insult, leading to her leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. The girlfriend insulted him directly by calling his shirt \"hideous.\" While that's not the most respectful way to interact, especially in a social setting, the author's response was to tell her to go fuck herself. That's a very strong and offensive retort.\n\nNow, considering social norms and respect. Even if someone says something hurtful, responding with aggression usually escalates the situation. The author didn't just respond politely or walk away; he used a vulgar and hostile reply. That's likely to be seen as inappropriate, regardless of the provocation.\n\nAlso, there's the context of the relationship. He's the best friend of the guy, so his actions could have a lasting impact on that friendship. The girlfriend was meeting the friend for the first time, and the initial interaction was negative. The author's response might have been a defense of his personal choice (the shirt) and possibly his wife's gift, but the way he handled it was extreme.\n\nThe wife's reaction (shock) suggests that his response was unexpected and possibly shocking. In social situations, it's generally expected to maintain some level of decorum, even when offended. Reacting with a vulgar insult is not considered acceptable behavior in most circles.\n\nHowever, there's an element of personal right here. The author might feel that his personal choice (wearing a shirt) was attacked. But the girlfriend had no right to insult him, and the author's response was disproportionate. The key here is the proportionality of the response. A verbal insult doesn't justify another verbal insult that's equally or more severe.\n\nAlso, considering the aftermath: the girlfriend left, the friend was confused, and the situation ended poorly. The author's action directly caused the conflict, which might mean he is at fault for not handling it more maturely.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, yes, the author overreacted. Even if the girlfriend was rude, the response was not appropriate. There are better ways to handle such situations without escalating to that level. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
