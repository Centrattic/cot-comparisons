      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself. The situation is that the girlfriend insulted his shirt, which his wife bought him. He lashed out, causing the girl to leave.\n\nFirst, the context matters. The girlfriend is a new person in his best friend's life, and meeting her for the first time is a social event. The author's reaction was immediate and aggressive. Insulting someone's clothing in a first meeting is pretty harsh, but the author's response was even worse. \n\nHe says he's not a fan of flannels, but the wife bought it for Christmas, making it his favorite. The girlfriend's comment was probably meant to be a casual remark, but he took it personally. The author's reaction of telling her to \"go fuck herself\" is rude and unprofessional, especially in a social setting. \n\nThe wife's shocked reaction also indicates that the author's response was unexpected and perhaps over the top. By doing that, he probably embarrassed himself, his wife, and the situation became uncomfortable for everyone. The girlfriend leaving and the friend chasing after her shows that the interaction had serious consequences.\n\nEven if the shirt was a gift and he felt attached to it, responding with such a strong insult isn't appropriate. There are better ways to handle such situations, like ignoring the comment or making a polite joke. Reacting with aggression doesn't resolve the issue and damages relationships. \n\nSo, considering all points, the author's actions were inconsiderate and unkind. He's in the wrong here.\n"
