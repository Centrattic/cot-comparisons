      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their best friend's new girlfriend to go fuck herself after she criticized his shirt.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's best friend has a new girlfriend. They meet for dinner, the girlfriend immediately criticizes the author's shirt as hideous. He was wearing a flannel that his wife bought him for Christmas, which he now likes. He responds by telling her to go fuck herself, she storms off, the friend is shocked, follows her, and they leave. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, the key points here. The girlfriend made a direct, possibly rude comment about his clothing. The author's reaction was extremely harsh\u2014using a very offensive phrase. The shirt is his wife's gift, which adds emotional weight for him. However, responding with such aggression might be seen as over the top.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Even if someone makes a rude comment, the appropriate response isn't to tell them to go fuck themselves. That's a very strong, disrespectful reply that could escalate the situation. The author might feel that his choice of clothing was being judged, especially since it's a gift from his wife, but his reaction wasn't proportionate. \n\nAlso, the context is a first meeting. The girlfriend's comment might have been inappropriate, but the author's response was even worse. The friend's reaction (shocked look and following her to leave) suggests that the friend found the author's behavior unacceptable. \n\nPossible defenses: The shirt was a gift, so the author might feel the comment was a personal attack. Also, the girlfriend's comment was immediate and perhaps inconsiderate. However, even if the comment was rude, responding with a curse-laced reply isn't socially acceptable. The author could have handled it better, like with a polite but firm retort or ignoring it. \n\nIs there a cultural context where this is acceptable? Probably not. The phrase \"go fuck yourself\" is generally considered offensive and confrontational. The author's action likely caused the friend to lose respect, and the girlfriend to storm off. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because his reaction was disproportionate. The girlfriend's comment, while rude, doesn't justify such a harsh response. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
