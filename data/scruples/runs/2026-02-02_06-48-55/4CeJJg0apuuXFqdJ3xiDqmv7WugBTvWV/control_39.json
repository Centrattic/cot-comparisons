      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who told their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" is in the wrong. The setup is that the girlfriend insulted the author's shirt, which the author's wife bought, and then the author responded with a harsh comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriateness. Insulting someone's clothing is generally considered rude, but the context matters. The girlfriend made a comment about the shirt immediately after meeting, which could be seen as a personal attack. However, responding with \"go fuck yourself\" is a strong reaction. Even if the shirt was an issue, the response is aggressive and unprofessional, especially in a social setting with one's spouse present.\n\nThe author's wife's shock indicates that the response was unexpected and possibly excessive. The action led to the girlfriend storming off and the friend leaving, which suggests it escalated the situation. While the comment about the shirt might be a personal offense, the author's retaliation crossed a line into disrespect. Relationships, even new ones, require some level of politeness and respect. Publicly berating someone for a fashion choice is unlikely to be appropriate, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the shirt was a gift from the wife might add emotional weight to the situation, but that doesn't justify a harsh response. The author could have addressed the comment privately or ignored it, rather than reacting with hostility. Therefore, the author's actions were inconsiderate and contributed to the conflict. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
