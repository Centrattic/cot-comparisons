My buddy introduced her and greet each other and then immediately after she looks me up and down and tell me that the shirt I\u2019m wearing is \u201chideous\u201d. \n\nNow I will not lie, I\u2019m not a fan of flannels buuuut my wife bought me this one for Christmas. Which means this is now my favorite shirt. \n\nI notice a look of shock on my wife\u2019s face and then I looked this girl dead in the eye and told her to go fuck herself. \n\nShe storms off and my buddy gives me this what just happened look and then follows her and they eventually leave. \n\nAm I The Asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's best friend's new girlfriend criticized his shirt, which his wife bought for him. The author then told her to \"go fuck herself,\" leading to her leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and appropriate behavior. Insulting someone, especially a guest or a new acquaintance, is generally frowned upon. Even if the comment was rude, responding with a curse-laden retort isn't the best approach. The author's reaction was immediate and harsh. \n\nThe shirt was a gift from his wife, so he might feel defensive. However, the girlfriend's comment was out of line. But that doesn't justify the author's response. The key here is how to handle such a situation gracefully. The author could have politely disagreed or ignored the comment, but choosing to insult her directly caused the situation to escalate.\n\nThe friend might feel embarrassed or upset that his new girlfriend was treated this way. The author's action could strain both his relationship with his friend and his wife, who was present. The wife's shocked reaction suggests that she didn't expect that response either.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's response was also inappropriate. There's no scenario where telling someone to \"go fuck themselves\" is acceptable in a social setting. The author could have handled it better without resorting to such a harsh reply. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
