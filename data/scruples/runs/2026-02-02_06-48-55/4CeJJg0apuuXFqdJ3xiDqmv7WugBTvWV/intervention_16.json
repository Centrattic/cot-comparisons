      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their best friend's new girlfriend to \"go fuck herself\" after the girlfriend criticized their shirt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's best friend introduced the girlfriend, and she insulted the author's shirt. The author's wife had given the shirt as a Christmas gift, making it a favorite. The author then responded with a harsh insult, leading to the girlfriend leaving and the friend following.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Was the author's response appropriate? 2) Did the girlfriend's comment justify such a reaction? 3) What are the social norms here?\n\nThe girlfriend's comment was an insult, but it's a personal choice to wear something, even if others dislike it. The author's response was aggressive and public, which could be seen as uncalled for. Even if the shirt was unflattering, a more diplomatic response might have been better, especially considering it's a new acquaintance and the best friend's partner. The author's wife was present, so her feelings were also involved. The author's action could damage the relationship with the best friend, who might now be upset with the author for causing the girlfriend to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's direct insult could be seen as rude, but responding with a curse-laced remark isn't a constructive way to handle it. Socially, it's generally expected to respond calmly, even to insults, to maintain decorum. The author's reaction was impulsive and disrespectful, which likely made things worse. Therefore, the author is probably at fault here for not handling the situation with more maturity and respect, even if the girlfriend was rude.\n"
