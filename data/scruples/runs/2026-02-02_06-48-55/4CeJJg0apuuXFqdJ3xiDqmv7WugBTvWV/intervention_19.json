      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's best friend's girlfriend insulted his shirt, which his wife bought for Christmas, and he told her to go fuck herself. The author then is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. Insulting someone's clothing, especially when it's a gift from a spouse, is rude. The author's reaction was to respond with a harsh insult, which is also inappropriate. Even if the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, responding with profanity and aggression would likely escalate the situation and cause a scene. \n\nThe context is a dinner meeting between friends and their families. The author's actions led to the girlfriend leaving and the friend following her. This could damage the friendship and the new relationship. The key factors here are the initial insult and the author's response. While the girlfriend's comment was rude, the author's reaction was overly aggressive and not a measured response. \n\nIn such situations, a more appropriate reaction might be to address the comment calmly, perhaps with a witty remark or ignoring it, rather than an explicit insult. The author's action directly caused the conflict to escalate, leading to an uncomfortable situation. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
