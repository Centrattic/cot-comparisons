I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The parent, who we'll call the author, introduced her to Karla and now wants to start seeing her too. The daughter is upset about this, citing privacy concerns. The author argues that Karla said it's okay and that they should be treated like a surgeon seeing both of them. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but the daughter is resistant. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main point is that Karla, the therapist, is okay with it, which is a professional opinion. However, the daughter is clearly uncomfortable. The author is dismissing the daughter's feelings as irrational or territorial, which might be a red flag. Even though the author mentions they want to respect their feelings, the way they frame the daughter's objections as something to be challenged could indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nTherapeutic boundaries are important. While the therapist might think it's okay from a professional standpoint, the daughter's privacy concerns are valid. Therapy is a confidential space, and sharing the same therapist could create discomfort or breaches of confidentiality, even if the therapist is careful. The daughter is a teenager, who is already at an age where they might be sensitive about privacy. The author comparing it to a surgeon seems like an oversimplification\u2014therapy involves more trust and privacy than surgery.\n\nAlso, the author is pushing back against the daughter's refusal to do family therapy with them. The daughter might feel that having the same therapist is a step towards forced family sessions, which she's already resistant to. The author's approach might be seen as not respecting the daughter's autonomy and emotional needs. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to seek help for themselves, which is important. But they need to balance that with their daughter's feelings. The therapist agreeing to see both could be okay if done with proper boundaries, but the daughter's consent and comfort are crucial. If the daughter is uncomfortable, the author's insistence without fully respecting that could be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention to seek therapy isn't inherently wrong, dismissing the daughter's valid privacy concerns and pushing despite her discomfort might make them at fault. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not adequately respecting their daughter's feelings and boundaries, even though the therapist is okay with it.\n"
