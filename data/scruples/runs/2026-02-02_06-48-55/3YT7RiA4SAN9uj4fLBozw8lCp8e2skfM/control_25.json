I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, while the therapist, Karla, is okay with it. The parent argues that Karla has already been part of their daughter's care and that they trust her, but the daughter feels it's a breach of privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. Teenagers often value their privacy, especially when it comes to therapy. Even if the parent knows a lot, the daughter might feel uncomfortable sharing personal issues with someone her parent also sees. There's a risk that the parent might find out things the daughter didn't intend to share, which could further damage their relationship.\n\nThen, there's the therapist's role. Therapists are trained to manage multiple clients, but having a parent and child as clients could complicate things. Even if Karla says it's okay, the dynamics might be tricky. The therapist has to maintain boundaries and ensure that each client's confidentiality is respected. The daughter might feel like her privacy isn't being protected, even if the therapist is following confidentiality rules. The parent might also unintentionally influence the therapy sessions or create pressure on the daughter.\n\nThe parent mentions the daughter is \"troubled\" and that they want to introduce family therapy, but the daughter refuses. The parent is trying to bridge that gap, but maybe the daughter isn't ready. The parent's approach might come across as dismissive of the daughter's feelings, especially if they're challenging her to give reasons for her objection. The parent might not be acknowledging the daughter's valid concerns about privacy and autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent has valid reasons too. They trust the therapist and might benefit from therapy themselves. However, the key issue here is the daughter's privacy and her right to have her own therapeutic space without the presence of her parent. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's feelings are important. The parent might not be considering the daughter's emotional state and how this decision affects her trust in both the parent and the therapist.\n\nIn professional settings, having a parent and child as clients can present challenges. The therapist needs to ensure that each session is separate and that there's no overlap of information unless the client consents. The daughter might fear that her private matters will be discussed with her parent, which could violate her sense of safety in therapy. The parent's insistence on seeing the same therapist might not take into account the daughter's mental health needs, potentially causing more distress.\n\nSo, while the parent's intentions might be good, the action of sharing the therapist could be harmful to the daughter's therapy process. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's boundaries, even if they believe they're acting in the family's best interest. The correct approach might be to find separate therapists or work towards family therapy on the daughter's terms, ensuring her consent and comfort.\n"
