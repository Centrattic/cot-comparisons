I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who started the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) thread is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent, let's say the father, introduced their daughter Ashley to therapist Karla a year ago. Now Karla is in private practice and the father wants to see her too. Ashley is upset about this, feeling it's a breach of her privacy. The therapist Karla says it's fine, but the daughter is resistant. The parent argues that since the therapist agrees, and they want family therapy, it's okay. The wife also thinks the parent is not the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the parent is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions. I need to decide between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. **Privacy and Confidentiality**: The daughter is concerned about her privacy. Even though the parent might know a lot, there's the aspect of professional confidentiality. The therapist can't discuss specific details if both are clients, which could be an issue. The daughter might feel her private matters are being shared or that the therapist's objectivity could be compromised if they're treating both parent and child.\n\n2. **Therapist's Role**: The therapist approved the arrangement. However, therapists have ethical guidelines. For instance, in many jurisdictions, therapists are advised against treating family members together because it can create complex dynamics, potential conflicts of interest, and challenges in maintaining neutrality. Even if Karla says it's okay, there might be unspoken ethical considerations she isn't addressing.\n\n3. **Daughter's Feelings**: The daughter is described as troubled and a typical teenager, which might mean she's sensitive or resistant to the idea. The parent is dismissing her feelings as \"territorial behavior\" or anger. But the daughter's resistance could stem from genuine concerns about privacy and the therapy's effectiveness if the parent is involved. The parent might be invalidating her feelings, which could worsen the situation.\n\n4. **Family Therapy Premise**: The parent mentions wanting family therapy, which is different from both seeing the same individual therapist. Family therapy involves structured sessions where all parties are present and the therapist facilitates. If the parent is just seeing the same therapist separately, that's different. If they're trying to do family therapy without the daughter's consent, that's another issue.\n\n5. **Power Dynamics**: The parent has the authority and might be imposing their decision on the daughter. Even if the parent thinks it's for the best, not respecting the daughter's boundaries could erode trust. The daughter might feel pressured into a situation where she's uncomfortable, which could be harmful.\n\n6. **Professional Standards**: Therapists generally avoid dual relationships (like treating family members) to prevent conflicts. Even if Karla thinks it's okay, there might be professional guidelines against it. The parent might not be aware of these, but it's a point to consider.\n\nPutting this together: The parent's main justification is that the therapist agrees, but the daughter's privacy and comfort are important. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's feelings need to be respected. The parent might be overstepping by trying to use the same therapist, especially if the daughter is resistant. The parent is also trying to push family therapy without the daughter's agreement, which could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy. So, the parent might be in the wrong by not respecting the daughter's boundaries and privacy, even with the therapist's approval.\n"
