I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the daughter (Ashley) has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent introduced her to Karla through a group session. Now Karla is in private practice, and the parent wants to start seeing her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about the privacy breach.\n\nThe parent argues that Karla is the only therapist they trust and that it's no different than a surgeon treating multiple family members. They also mention that Ashley refuses family therapy and that they want to avoid rewarding her anger. But the daughter and wife think the parent is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Therapists are supposed to maintain boundaries. Even if the therapist is okay with it, there are potential conflicts of interest. The daughter might feel her privacy is compromised, especially if the therapist shares information, which could affect their therapeutic relationship. Also, using the same therapist for family therapy doesn't make sense because the therapist is already working with the daughter. Family therapy would require different dynamics, and the therapist might not be impartial if they're treating both parent and child. \n\nThe parent's reasoning about trust is valid, but the daughter's concerns about privacy and the therapist's professional boundaries are important. Even if Karla says it's fine, the situation might be more complex. Therapists typically don't see family members of their existing patients to avoid conflicts and maintain neutrality. If the parent starts seeing Karla, it could blur the lines between professional and personal relationships, making it harder for Karla to be an objective therapist for Ashley. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A. The author is in the wrong because they're disregarding the daughter's privacy concerns and professional boundaries, even if the therapist is okay with it. The therapist's initial inclusion of the parent in the daughter's progress doesn't necessarily mean they can also treat the parent, as that's a different level of involvement.\n"
