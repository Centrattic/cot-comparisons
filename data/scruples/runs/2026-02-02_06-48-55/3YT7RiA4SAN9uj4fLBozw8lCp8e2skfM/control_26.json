I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. So, the parent, let's call them \"Author,\" has a daughter named Ashley who's been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The Author is now considering seeing Karla too, but Ashley is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The therapist, Karla, is okay with seeing the parent as well. That's a point in the Author's favor because the therapist's professional opinion is that there's no conflict of interest. But the daughter is against it, citing privacy concerns. The Author argues that they already know a lot about Ashley's issues and that this is similar to a surgeon treating multiple family members. The Author also mentions that family therapy is a possibility, but Ashley refuses to have therapy sessions with the parent or spouse present.\n\nSo, the key points here are professional boundaries, the daughter's privacy, and the potential for family therapy. The therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's feelings of privacy and autonomy are also significant. The Author is trying to balance respecting the daughter's feelings with their own need for therapy. \n\nTherapists are trained to maintain confidentiality, but even with that, having a parent as a client could create some complexities. The daughter might feel that her privacy is compromised, even if the therapist maintains professional standards. The Author might not realize that the daughter's privacy is a legitimate concern, not just teenage territory behavior. The Author's analogy to a surgeon is a bit different because surgeons don't typically share personal information about their patients with family, whereas therapists might discuss more personal issues.\n\nAdditionally, the Author wants to use this as a way to introduce family therapy, but the daughter isn't on board. Family therapy usually requires all parties to be willing participants. If Ashley is resistant, forcing the situation by having both parent and daughter see the same therapist might not be the best approach.\n\nSo, while the therapist's approval is a factor, the daughter's right to privacy and her comfort in therapy are also important. The Author might be overstepping by not fully acknowledging the daughter's concerns. It's possible that the daughter's privacy is being respected, but the mere fact that the parent is in the same therapist's practice could cause discomfort or a sense of intrusion. The Author's insistence on proceeding without addressing the daughter's valid concerns might be seen as disregarding her autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's privacy and consent are crucial. The Author might be in the wrong by not adequately considering the daughter's feelings beyond just acknowledging them. The answer could be A, but there's a nuance here. However, given the daughter's valid privacy concerns and the potential for family therapy resistance, the Author might be in the wrong. But the therapist's professional opinion is that it's acceptable, which complicates things. However, the daughter's consent is important in the context of family dynamics. So, maybe the answer is A (the Author is in the wrong) because they are prioritizing their own needs over the daughter's privacy concerns without fully respecting her autonomy.\n"
