I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (the parent) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, and the parent thinks the therapist is okay with it.\n\nFirst, the parent initially referred the daughter to the therapist through a military hospital. The daughter liked it, then moved to individual sessions. Now the therapist works independently, and the parent wants to also see her. The daughter objects, citing privacy concerns. The parent argues that the therapist said it's okay, and that it's similar to a family having the same surgeon. The parent also mentions wanting to start family therapy since the daughter refuses to do therapy with the parent and spouse present.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the daughter's privacy, the therapist's approval, and the parent's intentions. The parent believes the therapist's approval is sufficient, but the daughter feels it invades her privacy. The parent is trying to involve the therapist more in the family's dynamics, which might be a good move, but the daughter resists that. \n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists usually have guidelines about treating family members, especially if they're in a close relationship. Even if the therapist says it's okay, there might be professional guidelines against it. Also, the daughter's feelings about privacy are important. Even if the parent knows a lot about the daughter's issues, the act of sharing the same therapist could create a conflict. The parent might not realize that the therapist-patient relationship is confidential, and the daughter may feel that the parent is overstepping by wanting to be part of that dynamic. \n\nThe parent's reasoning about a surgeon analogy isn't quite the same, because a surgeon doesn't maintain ongoing confidential communication about a patient's personal issues. The parent might not be considering how the daughter's trust in the therapist could be affected. If the daughter feels her privacy is compromised, she might not be as open with the therapist, which could hinder her treatment.\n\nAlso, the parent's approach to challenging the daughter to give reasons might not be respectful of the daughter's feelings. The daughter is a teenager who's been through a lot, so her resistance could be valid. The parent might be underestimating the daughter's need for autonomy and privacy, which is crucial in therapy.\n\nSo, even though the therapist says it's okay, the parent might be ignoring the daughter's legitimate concerns. The answer might be that the parent is in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's privacy and pushing through despite her objections.\n"
