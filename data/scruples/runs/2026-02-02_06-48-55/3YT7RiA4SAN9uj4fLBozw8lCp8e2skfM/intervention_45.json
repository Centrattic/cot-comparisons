I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter. The father's daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The dad met Karla through the military hospital, sent Ashley to a group session, and now Karla is an independent therapist. The dad wants to start seeing Karla too, and Karla says it's okay. However, Ashley is upset about it and thinks it's an invasion of her privacy.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the therapist is okay with it, the daughter is against it, and the father wants to proceed. The father argues that the therapist would know best, and he's comparing it to a surgeon treating multiple family members. But the daughter is a teenager who's been through a lot and is resistant to family therapy. The wife also thinks the father is wrong.\n\nI need to consider professional ethics here. Therapists usually avoid dual relationships where they can have conflicts of interest. In this case, treating both parent and child might create boundaries issues. Even if Karla says it's fine, the daughter's privacy is a big concern. The therapist might need to maintain objectivity and not have both parties in the same session. If the daughter feels her privacy is violated, that's a valid concern. Also, the daughter's resistance might indicate she's uncomfortable, which the father is dismissing as just teen behavior. But maybe she has legitimate issues with her privacy being breached. \n\nThe father's approach might be overstepping by not respecting her boundaries. Even though the therapist is okay, the daughter's feelings are important. The father's comparison to a surgeon isn't quite parallel since therapists deal with confidentiality and personal issues differently. Also, the father is pushing for family therapy, but the daughter refuses sessions with family present, which complicates things further. \n\nI think the father is in the wrong here because he's disregarding his daughter's concerns about privacy and treating her feelings as irrational. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's consent and comfort are crucial. The father should maybe find a different therapist for himself to respect her boundaries. So the answer is A.\n"
