I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The author, a parent, approached Karla when she worked at their military hospital and started Ashley with her. Now Karla is independent and the parent wants to see her too. Ashley is against it, thinking it's a privacy breach. The parent argues that Karla said it's okay and that the daughter's objections are irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of a therapist seeing both a parent and their child. Generally, in therapy, when two people with a personal relationship start seeing the same therapist, it can complicate things. The American Psychological Association has guidelines against multiple relationships that could impair professional judgment. But in this case, the therapist already sees Ashley and the parent is asking to join. The therapist might have a conflict of interest here.\n\nThe daughter's privacy is a big concern. Even though the parent claims they already know a lot, the therapist-patient confidentiality is crucial. If the parent is seen by the same therapist, there's a risk that information could be shared, which might make the daughter feel her privacy is invaded. The daughter is \"troubled\" and the parent wants family therapy, but the daughter refuses sessions with the parent and spouse present. So maybe the parent's approach is to bypass that by seeing the same therapist.\n\nThe parent mentions that the therapist Karla said it's okay. But maybe the therapist isn't considering the potential for boundary issues here. It's possible that Karla is not fully aware of the dynamics or is not considering the daughter's perspective. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's feelings, even if they think the daughter is being irrational. The daughter's objection about privacy is valid, and respecting that is important for her therapy progress.\n\nAlso, the parent's analogy about a surgeon is flawed. A surgeon operates on the child, but a therapist has a different role involving trust and confidentiality. The daughter might feel that by having the same therapist, the parent could gain more insight into her personal issues than they otherwise would, which isn't healthy. The parent might be trying to control the situation or not taking the daughter's boundaries seriously.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions might be good, they are not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns and there's a potential for the therapist to have a conflict of interest. This could harm the daughter's therapy. So the answer would be that the parent is in the wrong.\n"
