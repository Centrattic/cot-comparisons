I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. \n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent, the author, met Karla through the military hospital and thought she was good for the daughter. Now Karla works independently, and the author wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about privacy and territorial feelings.\n\nThe author argues that the therapist approved it, and that it's similar to a surgeon treating both. They also mention wanting family therapy, which the daughter refuses otherwise. The wife and daughter think the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Typically, therapists avoid dual relationships because they can complicate the therapeutic process. Even if Karla says it's okay, there might be potential issues. The daughter's privacy is a big concern. If the therapist is treating both, there could be conflicts of interest, like the daughter feeling her privacy is invaded, or the parent pressuring the therapist.\n\nAlso, the daughter's resistance is valid. Teens might feel their privacy is being overstepped, even if the parent thinks they know a lot already. The parent's comparison to a surgeon isn't perfect because therapy involves more personal, emotional information. Plus, family therapy isn't the same as having a shared individual therapist; it's a different dynamic.\n\nThe therapist's approval might not be enough. Professional guidelines usually advise against such dual relationships. Even if Karla thinks it's okay, it might not align with standard practices. The parent might not be considering the daughter's feelings adequately, pushing through their own needs without respecting her right to privacy.\n\nSo, while the parent's intention is good\u2014to seek trusted help and maybe promote family therapy\u2014the action could breach ethical boundaries and harm the daughter's trust. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
