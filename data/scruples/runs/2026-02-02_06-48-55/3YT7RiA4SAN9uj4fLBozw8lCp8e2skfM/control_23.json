I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter is upset about it, but the therapist thinks it's okay. The author argues that the therapist is professional and that it's similar to having the same surgeon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, and teens often value their privacy, especially in therapy. Therapy is a safe space, and having a parent involved might make her feel like her privacy is invaded. Even though the parent knows a lot already, the confidentiality aspect is important. The daughter might feel that her personal issues are being discussed with someone she's supposed to trust exclusively. \n\nThe therapist's opinion is that there's no conflict of interest. But therapists usually have a code of ethics. For example, in many professional guidelines, a therapist can't treat both a patient and a family member if it might interfere with the patient's care. The therapist might not be aware of all the potential issues, like the daughter feeling pressured or the dynamics between parent and child affecting therapy sessions. \n\nThe parent wants to use this as a step towards family therapy, but the daughter refuses any sessions with the parents present. So, pushing for the same therapist might not address the underlying issues and could create more tension. The parent might be ignoring the daughter's emotional needs here, which is a red flag. \n\nAlso, the parent is comparing it to a surgeon, but therapy is different. Surgeons operate on the body, where privacy is different from the emotional and psychological space a therapist creates. The daughter's discomfort is valid and shouldn't be dismissed as irrational. The parent is trying to rationalize the situation, but they might not be respecting the daughter's boundaries enough. \n\nSo, even though the therapist says it's okay, the ethical guidelines and the daughter's feelings suggest that it's problematic. The parent should prioritize the daughter's comfort and privacy. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
