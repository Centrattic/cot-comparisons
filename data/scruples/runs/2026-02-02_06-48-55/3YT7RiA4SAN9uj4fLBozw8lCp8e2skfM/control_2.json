I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. The daughter is a teenager who values her privacy. Therapists often emphasize confidentiality, so the daughter might feel that having her parent involved could undermine that. The parent acknowledges patient confidentiality but the daughter still feels it's an invasion. That's a valid concern because teens are at an age where they're seeking independence, and sharing personal issues with a therapist that their parent also knows could cause discomfort or reluctance to open up.\n\nThen there's the therapist's opinion. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay. But therapists have professional training to assess such situations. However, even if the therapist is comfortable, the daughter's feelings are important. The parent is dismissing the daughter's anger as irrational or territorial, which might not be the case. The daughter's resistance could stem from genuine privacy concerns rather than just being a rebellious teen.\n\nThe parent wants to use this as a way into family therapy, which is a good intention, but the daughter is already refusing to have her parents present in sessions. If the parent pushes for the same therapist, it might backfire, making the daughter less likely to engage in therapy altogether. The parent is also comparing it to a surgeon operating on both of them, which is different because surgery is a medical necessity, whereas therapy involves personal, sensitive information.\n\nThe wife and daughter think the parent is in the wrong. The parent's approach might not consider the daughter's emotional needs and could harm the therapeutic relationship. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's well-being and willingness to continue therapy should be the priority. The parent's insistence could breach trust, which is crucial in therapy.\n\nSo, the parent's actions might be well-meaning, but they're disregarding the daughter's feelings and the potential negative impact on her therapy. The correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns and might be causing more harm than good.\n"
