I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The parent, who's part of the military, met Karla through the hospital and referred their daughter to her. Now Karla works independently, and the parent wants to see her too. The therapist agrees, but the daughter is upset about it, feeling it's a privacy breach. The parent thinks it's similar to both being treated by the same surgeon and wants to start family therapy since Ashley refuses sessions with family present. The parent's spouse and daughter think the parent is wrong, but the therapist says it's okay.\n\nSo, the main points are: therapist's consent, daughter's privacy concerns, parent's perspective on family therapy. \n\nTherapists usually maintain confidentiality, so even if Karla agrees, the daughter might feel her privacy is invaded. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's boundaries, even if the therapist approves. The daughter is a teenager, which can make such situations more sensitive. The parent's analogy to a surgeon is flawed because therapy involves more confidentiality than medical procedures. Also, using family therapy as a way to get the daughter to open up might not be the best approach if she's resistant. The parent might be dismissing the daughter's valid feelings of privacy, which could strain their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the therapist's approval is a point in favor. If the therapist thinks it's okay, maybe there's a professional reason. But the daughter's emotional well-being is important too. The parent's intention is to connect through therapy, but the method might be problematic. The daughter's refusal for family therapy could indicate she's not ready, and pushing might not help. \n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong since they're trying to seek help and the therapist agrees. But ignoring the daughter's privacy concerns could be an issue. It's a balance between respecting the daughter's boundaries and seeking therapeutic support. The parent's dismissal of the daughter's anger as \"territorial behavior\" might not be justified, as the daughter's feelings are valid. \n\nMaybe the answer leans towards the parent not being in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance. The key factors are therapist's approval, the parent's intentions, and the daughter's perspective. Since the therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset, it's a tricky situation. However, the parent is acting in what they believe is a positive way (family therapy) and has professional backing. So, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they might need to address the daughter's feelings more sensitively.\n"
