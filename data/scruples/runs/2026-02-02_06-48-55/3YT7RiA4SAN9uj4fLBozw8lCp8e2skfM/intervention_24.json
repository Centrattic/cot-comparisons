I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley.\n\nFirst, the parent sent Ashley to see Karla a year ago, and now Karla works independently. The parent wants to see Karla too, and Karla says it's okay. But Ashley is upset about her privacy. The parent argues that Karla is the only therapist they trust and that it's similar to being operated on by the same surgeon. The wife and daughter think the parent is at fault, but the parent thinks Karla would know if there's an issue.\n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Typically, therapists avoid dual relationships, which include having multiple relationships with the same patient. But here, the parent and daughter are separate patients. However, there's a potential conflict of interest. If Karla is treating both, she might face challenges in maintaining confidentiality and objectivity, especially since the parent initiated the daughter's therapy. There's also the daughter's right to privacy; sharing information between parent and therapist could breach that. The parent might be undermining the daughter's autonomy by pushing to see the same therapist, especially if the daughter is resistant. Even though Karla agrees, the ethical guidelines might advise against it. The parent's argument about family therapy isn't happening, so using Karla for individual sessions might not address the issues. The parent's insistence could be seen as disregarding the daughter's feelings, which might harm their relationship. So, while the parent has valid reasons, the potential ethical issues and the daughter's privacy concerns suggest the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
