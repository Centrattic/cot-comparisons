I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author's daughter has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The author met her through the military hospital and now Dr. Karla works independently. The author wants to see her too, but Ashley is against it, citing privacy concerns. The therapist says it's okay. The author feels it's similar to sharing a surgeon. The wife and daughter think the author is wrong, but the therapist is okay with it. \n\nI should think about the daughter's perspective. Teenagers often value their privacy, especially with a therapist. Sharing a therapist might make her uncomfortable, even if the therapist says it's okay. There's also the aspect of patient confidentiality. The therapist can't share details between parent and child, which the author acknowledges. But the daughter might feel like her privacy is being invaded, even if the therapist is professional. \n\nThe author wants to use this as a way to introduce family therapy, but Ashley refuses family therapy sessions. The author is concerned about her well-being and their own. However, pushing into her therapist's space might not be the best approach. The daughter's resistance could be a sign that she needs boundaries, especially if she's been through a lot. \n\nThe therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's feelings are valid too. The author is trying to balance their concern with respecting Ashley's autonomy. However, the daughter is clearly upset, and the author is dismissing her concerns as irrational or territorial. That could be a red flag. \n\nIn family dynamics, respecting each member's boundaries is key. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's discomfort shouldn't be ignored. The author might be overstepping, thinking they know what's best, but the daughter's right to privacy in therapy is significant. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be, because they're disregarding their daughter's feelings and privacy concerns, even if they have good intentions. The answer might be A, but I need to make sure. \n\nAlternatively, the author is seeking help and the therapist agrees, so maybe it's not their fault. But the daughter's distress is real. The line here is between parental concern and the child's right to privacy. Since the daughter is an adolescent, her autonomy is important. The author's push might be seen as intrusive. So, the answer could be A.\n"
