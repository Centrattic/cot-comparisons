I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The parent and daughter have been using the same therapist, Karla, for a while. The daughter is now upset because the parent wants to continue their sessions with Karla, possibly leading to family therapy. The daughter feels it breaches her privacy, even though the therapist approves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical guidelines for therapists. Most professional ethics, like those from the APA, emphasize confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest. If a therapist is treating both a parent and child, there could be potential issues. The therapist might have dual relationships, which are generally discouraged because they can impair objectivity and harm the therapeutic relationship. Even if the therapist says it's okay, maybe they're not fully aware of all the implications. \n\nThe daughter's perspective is important. She's a teenager going through a lot, and her privacy is a significant concern. Even if the parent already knows a lot, the daughter might feel her trust is being violated. The parent's reasoning, like comparing it to a surgeon, might not address the therapeutic relationship's unique nature. \n\nThe therapist's approval might not be enough. The therapist could have a conflict of interest in their own judgment if they're treating both parties. The parent might be undermining the daughter's autonomy and trust, which is crucial for the daughter's therapy. Also, the daughter's refusal to have family therapy sessions with the parent and spouse suggests existing tension. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent wants to address family issues and has the therapist's initial approval. But the main issue is whether the therapist's agreement is sufficient. Professional guidelines usually advise against such dual relationships. Therefore, the parent might be disregarding these guidelines, even if the therapist thinks it's okay. \n\nSo, considering ethical standards and the daughter's right to privacy, the parent is likely in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
