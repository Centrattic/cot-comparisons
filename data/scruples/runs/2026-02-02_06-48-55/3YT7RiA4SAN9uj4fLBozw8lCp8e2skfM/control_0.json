I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist their daughter is seeing. The daughter is upset about this, feeling it invades her privacy. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay, but the parent's wife and daughter disagree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. Teens often value their privacy, especially when it comes to therapy. Therapy sessions are confidential, and the daughter might feel that having her parent involved, even with the same therapist, could make her less open or feel like her private issues are being shared. The parent points out that they already know a lot, but patient confidentiality is a key part of therapy, so the daughter's concern is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent has a legitimate reason too. They trust the therapist and want to be involved in their family's mental health. The parent mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy, so maybe the parent sees this as a way to initiate that. The therapist also agrees it's okay, which probably means there's a professional judgment that it's manageable.\n\nBut there's a potential conflict of interest here. Even if the therapist says it's okay, the parent should consider the daughter's feelings. The daughter's anger might stem from feeling that her privacy isn't respected. The parent might be overstepping by not backing down despite the daughter's clear discomfort. The parent's argument about the surgeon analogy might not hold because therapy is different from surgery in terms of privacy and emotional dynamics.\n\nThe parent's wife also disagrees, which suggests there's a family dynamic at play. The parent might not realize that the daughter's resistance is about more than just irrationality\u2014it could be trauma or a need for autonomy. The parent insisting on seeing the same therapist despite the daughter's objections might actually hinder the daughter's healing if she feels pressured.\n\nSo, while the therapist's approval is important, the parent needs to balance respect for the daughter's autonomy and privacy. The parent's actions could be seen as dismissing the daughter's valid concerns, which is where they might be in the wrong. The key is whether the parent is prioritizing their own desire for family therapy over the daughter's right to privacy.\n"
