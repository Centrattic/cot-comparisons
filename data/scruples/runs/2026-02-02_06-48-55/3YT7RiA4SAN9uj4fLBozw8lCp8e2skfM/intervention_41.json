I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The situation is that Ashley is seeing a therapist named Karla, and the parent (the author) wants to start seeing Karla too. The daughter is upset, thinking it's a privacy breach, but the therapist says it's okay. The parent is pushing back, comparing it to sharing a surgeon, and wants to do family therapy, but the daughter refuses sessions with parents present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Therapists have boundaries to protect patient confidentiality. Even if Karla says it's okay, there's a potential conflict of interest here. If the parent starts seeing Karla, the therapist might have to navigate confidentiality for both patients, which could be tricky. The daughter's concern about privacy is valid because sharing a therapist could lead to information being shared between the parent and child's sessions, which the daughter might not want.\n\nThe parent mentions that Karla is inclusive with Ashley's progress, but even if Karla shares some information, the parent shouldn't have access to all of it due to confidentiality. The parent's approach of challenging the daughter to give reasons for her objection might not be the best way to handle it. Teenagers, especially those with emotional issues, might feel their privacy is being invaded, leading to resistance.\n\nThe parent's analogy to a surgeon isn't the best fit. Surgeons operate on different people but don't share personal health details between patients. Therapists, however, deal with personal and sensitive information where confidentiality is crucial. So the comparison might not hold.\n\nAlso, the parent wants to push family therapy without the daughter's consent. If the daughter refuses family sessions, forcing her might not be effective and could worsen the relationship. The parent's insistence on not rewarding \"irrational\" behavior might overlook the daughter's valid feelings about privacy.\n\nWhile the therapist agrees, it's possible that Karla might not fully realize the potential complications. The parent should consider the daughter's feelings more and maybe seek another therapist to avoid conflicts. Respecting the daughter's autonomy and privacy is important, even if the parent feels they have a right to know certain things.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns and pushing for shared therapy without her consent. Even though the therapist agrees, the core issue is the daughter's right to privacy in her sessions. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
