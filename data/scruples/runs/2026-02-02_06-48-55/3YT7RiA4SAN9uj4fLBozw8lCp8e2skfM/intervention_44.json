I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a parent (the author) who wants to see the same therapist their daughter, Ashley, is seeing. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but Ashley is upset about it. The author is trying to balance respecting Ashley's feelings with not giving in to her anger or what they see as irrational behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they often start asserting their independence. Privacy is a big concern for teens, especially in therapy, which is a confidential space. The author argues that the therapist isn't against it and that they want to use this as a way to introduce family therapy since Ashley is resistant to that. But Ashley is clearly uncomfortable, feeling it's a privacy breach.\n\nThe therapist's role is to maintain confidentiality between the client and themselves. If the parent is involved in the same sessions, that dynamic changes. Even though the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's feelings are valid. The parent might not see a problem because they know a lot already, but the daughter's right to privacy in therapy is protected by confidentiality laws. The parent might be overstepping by wanting to share the same therapist, even if the therapist is okay with it, because the daughter's consent and comfort are key here.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy with the parent and spouse. Wanting to see the same therapist could be a way for the parent to bypass the daughter's resistance, which isn't addressing the underlying issues. The parent might not realize that their approach could be perceived as controlling, even if their intentions are good. The daughter's resistance to family therapy might stem from trust issues or past experiences, which the parent isn't acknowledging. \n\nThe therapist, Karla, says it's fine, but her professional opinion doesn't override the daughter's emotional response. The parent's argument about a surgeon example is a bit of a stretch because surgery is a different context. Therapy involves personal, sensitive information, and sharing the same therapist might not be analogous to a medical procedure. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions might be to help and involve themselves in the family's mental health, the daughter's privacy and consent are crucial. Overriding her feelings here, even if the therapist is okay with it, could be seen as the parent being in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
