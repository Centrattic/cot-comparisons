I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The parent met Dr. Karla through the military hospital and thought she was a good fit. The daughter liked her and started individual sessions. Now Dr. Karla works independently, and the parent wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about privacy concerns. The parent argues that they already know a lot and that confidentiality is in place. The daughter is a troubled teen, and the parent wants family therapy but the daughter refuses sessions with them present.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's privacy vs. the parent's desire for family therapy. The therapist is okay with it, but the daughter isn't. The parent is trying to push through, thinking the daughter's anger is irrational or territorial.\n\nI need to consider the ethics of dual relationships in therapy. Therapists are generally advised to avoid dual relationships (like treating multiple family members) because it can lead to conflicts of interest, boundary issues, and potential for harm. Even if the therapist says it's okay, there might be professional guidelines against it. For example, the APA's Ethical Principles mention that therapists should avoid relationships that could impair their objectivity or harm the client.\n\nThe daughter is concerned about privacy. Even if the parent claims to know a lot, the daughter might feel that her private discussions could be shared, even if legally confidential. The parent's argument that it's like having the same surgeon is a bit of a stretch because therapy involves more sensitive personal information and the dynamics are different from a medical procedure.\n\nAlso, the parent is pushing for family therapy, but the daughter refuses sessions with parents present. Forcing family therapy without the daughter's consent might not be effective and could increase resistance. The therapist's role is to maintain the daughter's best interest, so if the daughter is against it, the therapist should prioritize her needs.\n\nEven though the therapist is supportive, the parent might not be considering the daughter's perspective properly. The daughter's objections are about privacy, which is a valid concern. The parent might be overlooking the potential for the daughter to feel her privacy is invaded, even if technically confidential. The parent's approach could be seen as disregarding the daughter's autonomy and emotional needs, which is a key part of ethical therapy practices.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the parent's intentions might be good, the situation involves potential ethical issues and the daughter's rights. The parent might be in the wrong by not respecting the daughter's concerns about privacy and by possibly overstepping in their desire for family therapy without the daughter's consent.\n"
