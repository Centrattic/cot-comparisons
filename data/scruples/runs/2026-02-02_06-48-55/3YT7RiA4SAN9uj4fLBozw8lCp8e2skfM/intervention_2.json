I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the parent) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent (let's say Dad) arranged for Ashley to start with Karla and now wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about privacy and territorial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of a therapist seeing both a parent and their child. Generally, therapists are trained to avoid dual relationships to prevent conflicts of interest. If the therapist is okay with it, maybe they've considered that. But the daughter feels her privacy is being breached. Even though the parent says they respect confidentiality, the daughter's feelings about privacy are valid. Teens might feel their autonomy is being undermined.\n\nThe parent brings up the surgeon analogy, but that's not exactly the same. A surgeon treating both parent and child isn't a conflict, but a therapist dealing with emotional issues might have different dynamics. Family therapy is a possibility, but the daughter refuses. The parent is trying to bridge that gap, but the daughter's resistance could be about feeling invaded.\n\nThe therapist's role here is tricky. If Karla is comfortable, maybe she's following some ethical guidelines, but there's a risk of the daughter feeling like the parent is overstepping. The parent might be trying to support their family, but they need to respect the daughter's feelings and boundaries. The daughter's anger could be a sign that the parent is not respecting her autonomy, which is crucial for a teenager.\n\nSo, the parent's intention is good, but the method might be problematic. They need to balance their desire for support with the daughter's need for privacy. Even if the therapist is okay, the daughter's well-being is important. The parent might not be in the \"wrong\" in a strict sense if the therapist agrees, but there's a gray area. However, considering the daughter's perspective and the potential for boundary issues, the answer might be that the parent is in the wrong for not adequately respecting the daughter's boundaries despite the therapist's approval.\n"
