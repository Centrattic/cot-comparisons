I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the therapist, Karla, has already agreed to see the author after working with the daughter. She's said it's okay, so that's a professional opinion. The daughter is upset about privacy, but the parent mentions that patient confidentiality is a thing, so maybe the therapist handles each case separately. \n\nThe parent wants to build family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with them or their wife. The daughter is a teenager going through a lot, which can make her resistant. The parent is trying to connect, but the daughter feels it's a privacy invasion. \n\nThe parent is using a surgeon analogy to explain how it's okay. The wife and daughter think the parent is wrong, but the therapist doesn't. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider the daughter's right to privacy. Even though the therapist is okay with it, the daughter might feel uncomfortable. However, the parent is trying to get help, and the therapist's agreement is important. But there's a risk of conflict of interest if the therapist takes sides or if the daughter's privacy is compromised. \n\nThe key points: Parent's right to choose a therapist, daughter's privacy, therapist's approval, and the potential for family therapy. The answer hinges on whether respecting the daughter's feelings overrides the parent's choice, even with the therapist's blessing. \n\nIn many cases, a therapist might avoid seeing a patient's family member to prevent boundaries issues. But here, the therapist says it's okay. However, the daughter's consent isn't mentioned. Some therapists might require the patient's agreement. If the daughter isn't comfortable, the parent might be overstepping. \n\nSo, while the therapist agrees, the daughter's privacy and consent are crucial. The parent might not be in the wrong if the therapist is okay, but they might be ignoring the daughter's feelings. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could be B (No) because the therapist agreed, but some might argue A (Yes) because the daughter's consent isn't considered. But since the daughter is a minor, the parent might have authority. However, the daughter's feelings are valid. Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is B because the therapist is okay with it, and the parent is trying to engage in family therapy, which could be beneficial. But if the daughter's privacy is at risk, then maybe A. I'm a bit torn. But since the therapist is okay, and the parent is trying to connect, perhaps B is the answer.\n"
