I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario involves a daughter who's been seeing a therapist, and now the parent wants to start sessions with the same practitioner. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about the privacy issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, and privacy is crucial during that stage. Even if the parent thinks they know a lot already, the daughter might feel that sharing personal issues with someone who also knows her parents could make her less open. It's about trust and confidentiality. The parent mentions patient confidentiality, which is a valid point, but the daughter's perception of privacy is still a real concern. If she feels uncomfortable, she might withdraw or be dishonest in therapy, which could hinder her progress.\n\nThen there's the therapist's role. The therapist has agreed in principle, but even if it's professional, the dynamic between family members and the same therapist can be tricky. Therapists have to maintain boundaries, and having both parent and child as clients might create conflicts. The parent might unintentionally influence the sessions or the therapist could be biased. Also, the daughter's resistance could indicate that she feels her space is being invaded, which might affect the therapeutic relationship.\n\nThe parent's reasoning includes wanting to model therapy as a positive thing and possibly starting family therapy. But the daughter is already resistant to family therapy, so forcing the same therapist might not help. The parent's comparison to a surgeon is a bit off; while a surgeon treats both, a therapist deals with emotional and psychological issues where confidentiality is paramount. The parent's approach might come off as dismissive of the daughter's feelings, especially if the daughter is \"troubled\" as mentioned. The parent needs to balance their own needs with the daughter's autonomy and emotional well-being.\n\nThe wife's opinion isn't specified, but the parent mentions she and the daughter think the parent is in the wrong. The parent is trying to be understanding but also firm, which is a delicate balance. However, overriding the daughter's objection without a strong, compassionate reason could be seen as authoritarian. The daughter's \"territorial\" behavior might be a symptom of deeper issues she's dealing with, so the parent needs to address that rather than just dismissing the anger as irrational.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions might be good, the key here is respecting the daughter's autonomy and privacy. The therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's comfort and willingness to engage in therapy are equally critical. The parent might not be outright in the wrong, but they need to consider the daughter's perspective more deeply and perhaps find alternative ways to address their own need for therapy without encroaching on the daughter's space. So the answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong (B), but with a nuanced consideration that their approach could be improved.\n"
