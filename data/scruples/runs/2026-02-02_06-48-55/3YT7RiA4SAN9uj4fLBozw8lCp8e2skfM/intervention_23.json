I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing a therapist named Karla for a year. The parent (the author) approached Karla to also be their therapist, and Karla agreed. However, Ashley is upset and thinks it's a breach of privacy, even though the parent argues that there's nothing they don't already know except confidential matters. The parent also mentions that the wife and daughter think the parent is in the wrong (TA), but the therapist thinks it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical and professional boundaries in therapy. Therapists are supposed to maintain confidentiality unless there's a risk of harm. If the parent wants to see the same therapist, the therapist should assess whether this could create conflicts of interest or compromise the therapeutic relationship with the daughter. The parent mentions that Karla said it's fine, so maybe she's confident there's no conflict.\n\nHowever, the daughter feels her privacy is being invaded. Even if the parent knows a lot, the daughter's comfort is crucial in therapy. If the daughter feels the therapist is more focused on the parent or if there's a breach of confidentiality, it could affect her willingness to open up. The parent's argument that it's like being operated on by the same surgeon might not address the emotional aspect of therapy, which is more personal.\n\nAlso, the parent wants to use this as a way to start family therapy, but the daughter refuses having her parents in sessions. The parent might not realize that the daughter's resistance is significant and could lead to further resistance if forced. The therapist's role is to support the client, so if the daughter is distressed, the therapist should prioritize her needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to seek help for themselves, which is valid. If Karla has assessed it and found no conflict, maybe it's acceptable. But the daughter's feelings can't be ignored. The parent might not be considering the daughter's perspective enough, pushing despite her objections. The parent's challenge to the daughter to give a reason might come off as dismissive, not respecting her valid concerns about privacy.\n\nIn therapy ethics, the client's autonomy and comfort are key. If the daughter is upset, the therapist should probably avoid taking the parent as a client to prevent any appearance of a conflict. The parent might be overlooking the daughter's emotional needs in favor of their own. Therefore, even though the therapist thinks it's okay, the parent might be in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's boundaries and feelings.\n"
