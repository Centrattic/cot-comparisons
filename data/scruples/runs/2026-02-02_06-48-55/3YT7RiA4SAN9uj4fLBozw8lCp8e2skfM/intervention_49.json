I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent (the author) now wants to see Karla too, but the daughter is upset about it. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is concerned about privacy. The author wants to respect her feelings but also thinks the daughter is being irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical guidelines for therapists. I remember that therapists have strict boundaries to maintain confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest. If a therapist is treating both a parent and their child, it can create multiple issues. For instance, the therapist might struggle to remain impartial, and confidentiality between the daughter and the therapist could be compromised. Even if the therapist believes it's okay, professional standards might not support it.\n\nThe author mentioned that the daughter is a teenager with some troubles and that she's not open to family therapy. The parent's reasoning is that the therapist is a skilled professional and wants to use this as a step towards family therapy. But teenagers might feel that their privacy is invaded when a parent is involved with their therapist. The daughter's resistance could stem from a desire to maintain her own therapeutic space without her parent's influence.\n\nEven though the therapist Karla said it's fine, professional ethics might require her to avoid dual relationships. Dual relationships can impair the therapist's objectivity and lead to exploitation or harm. The parent's insistence despite the daughter's concerns could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and privacy. The parent might not be considering how this arrangement could affect the daughter's trust in therapy or her willingness to open up.\n\nThe daughter might feel that her parent is overstepping, especially if she's resistant to family therapy. The parent's analogy about a surgeon is flawed because in surgery, the relationship is more transactional without the same confidentiality needs as therapy. The parent's argument that they already know most things doesn't account for the importance of patient-therapist confidentiality in building a safe therapeutic environment.\n\nSo, even though the therapist is okay with it, professional standards and ethical considerations suggest that the parent's request could be problematic. The daughter's privacy and comfort in therapy are crucial, and the parent's actions might undermine that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not fully respecting their daughter's concerns and the potential ethical issues involved.\n"
