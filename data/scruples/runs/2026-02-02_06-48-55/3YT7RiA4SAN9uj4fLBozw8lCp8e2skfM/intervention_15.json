I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a parent (the author) who has been helping their daughter, Ashley, connect with a therapist named Karla. Now the parent wants to become a client of Karla as well, but Ashley is upset about it. The parent feels that since Karla is a trusted therapist and she's okay with it, they're not in the wrong, but the daughter and wife disagree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries in a therapeutic relationship. Therapists have professional guidelines to avoid dual relationships that could compromise their objectivity or the client's trust. In this case, if the therapist sees both the parent and the daughter, there could be potential conflicts. For example, if the daughter shares something in therapy that the parent also discusses, the therapist might have to navigate confidentiality issues. Even if the therapist initially says it's okay, maintaining that professional boundary could become tricky as the dynamics between parent and child play out in therapy.\n\nThe daughter is a teenager, which can be a time of heightened sensitivity around privacy. Even if the parent knows a lot about her life, the daughter might feel that having the same therapist as her parent would violate her trust. The parent mentions that the daughter can't give a specific reason, but the daughter's anger might be rooted in feeling that her privacy is being invaded. It's possible that the daughter isn't just being territorial but is genuinely uncomfortable with the idea of her therapist also knowing her parent's personal issues.\n\nThe parent's argument about a surgeon analogy might not fully apply here. A surgeon treats physical issues, and the relationship is different from a therapist who deals with emotional and psychological matters. The parent's reasoning about family therapy might also be a stretch because the daughter refuses family therapy sessions, so using the same therapist might not serve that purpose effectively. The therapist's agreement might not account for the long-term implications or the daughter's feelings, which are valid even if they seem irrational to the parent.\n\nFrom a professional ethics standpoint, many therapy associations advise against dual relationships. The therapist might not see an immediate issue, but there could be unanticipated complications. The parent's decision could lead to the daughter feeling pressured or uncomfortable, potentially affecting her therapy progress. The parent's desire to maintain control or avoid giving in to what they perceive as the daughter's anger might override the daughter's need for privacy and autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's concerns about privacy, even if they have good intentions. The therapist's initial approval doesn't necessarily mean it's the right decision long-term. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the parent isn't fully respecting the daughter's boundaries and the potential ethical issues involved.\n"
