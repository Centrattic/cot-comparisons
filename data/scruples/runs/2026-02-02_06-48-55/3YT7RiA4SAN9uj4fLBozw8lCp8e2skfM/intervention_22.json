I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but Ashley is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author initially referred their daughter to Karla when she worked at the on-base hospital. Now Karla is independent, and the author wants to see her too. The main issue is Ashley's privacy concerns. The author argues that they already know most things except for confidential details, and that Karla says it's fine. The author also mentions that Ashley refuses family therapy and that they want to model healthy behavior by seeing the same therapist.\n\nFrom a confidentiality standpoint, therapists are bound by strict rules to protect patient information. Even if the author is a parent, the therapist must maintain that boundary. However, the therapist might have a way to manage both cases without mixing information, as they are different clients. The author's desire to do family therapy is understandable, but Ashley's refusal suggests she's not ready for that. The author's comparison to a surgeon isn't perfect because therapists handle sensitive, personal information differently than surgeons do.\n\nThe daughter's anger could stem from feeling that her privacy is being invaded. Even if the author isn't accessing confidential info, the perception might still be that their relationship with the therapist is being overshadowed by their parent. The author might be dismissing Ashley's feelings as \"irrational\" or \"territorial,\" which could be invalidating her valid concerns about privacy and autonomy. \n\nTherapists often encourage family involvement when appropriate, but if the daughter is resistant, pushing the issue could harm the therapeutic relationship for her. The author's reasoning that Karla would know best might not account for how the daughter feels. While the therapist's approval is important, the child's emotional response is also significant. The author might need to consider that their child's reaction is legitimate and that forcing the issue could backfire, especially if Ashley is already struggling with her own mental health.\n\nSo, balancing the parent's intentions to support the family and the child's need for privacy, the author might be overstepping by not respecting Ashley's boundaries. Even if Karla is okay with it, the daughter's feelings shouldn't be ignored. The answer could hinge on whether respecting the child's autonomy is more important than the parent's desire for shared therapy.\n"
