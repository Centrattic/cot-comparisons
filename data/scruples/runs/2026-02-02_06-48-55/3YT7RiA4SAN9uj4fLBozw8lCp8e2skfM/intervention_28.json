I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The therapist, Karla, works independently now and the author wants to see her as well. The daughter is upset about it, thinking it breaches her privacy. The author argues that the therapist said it's okay and that it's similar to having the same surgeon. The wife and daughter think the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists have strict confidentiality rules. If a therapist is treating both a parent and a child, that could create a dual relationship, which is generally discouraged in therapy. The American Psychological Association, for example, has guidelines against multiple relationships that could impair professional judgment or increase the risk of harm. Even if the therapist says it's okay, there might be underlying issues.\n\nThe daughter's concern about privacy is valid. Even if the parent knows a lot, there's stuff protected by confidentiality. The parent might feel they need to know, but the daughter's right to privacy is important. The parent's argument about it being like a surgeon isn't directly relevant; therapy involves more personal information and relational dynamics that surgery doesn't. \n\nThe parent wants to use this as a way into family therapy, but the daughter refuses sessions with parents. Forcing the issue might make her more resistant. The therapist's approval is mentioned, but maybe the therapist isn't considering all the implications. If Karla is the therapist for both, maintaining objectivity and avoiding conflicts of interest could be challenging. The parent's approach might undermine the daughter's trust in therapy.\n\nSo, the parent's desire to see the same therapist, despite the daughter's objections, could be crossing ethical lines. The daughter's privacy and comfort are significant factors here. Even if the parent's intentions are good, the situation might be ethically problematic. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
