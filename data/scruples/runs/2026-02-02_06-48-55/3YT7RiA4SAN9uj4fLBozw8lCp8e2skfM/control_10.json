I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the parent (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The main points are:\n\n1. The daughter has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent initially suggested her because she worked at the on-base hospital and later when Karla went independent, the daughter continued with her.\n2. The parent now wants to see Karla too. Karla says it's okay and that there's no conflict of interest.\n3. The daughter objects, citing privacy concerns. The parent dismisses her concerns, thinking they're irrational or territorial, and compares it to a surgeon treating the whole family.\n4. The parent feels Karla's approval is sufficient and wants to use this as a way to start family therapy since the daughter refuses to do it otherwise.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the daughter's privacy concerns versus the parent's desire to have a therapist they trust. The therapist has given the go-ahead, but the daughter is upset. The parent is pushing back, saying that the daughter's objections are unfounded.\n\nFirst, from a professional standpoint, therapists are supposed to avoid conflicts of interest. The American Psychological Association has guidelines about multiple relationships, which can impair objectivity or exploit the person. If the therapist is treating both parent and child, that's a dual relationship, which is generally discouraged unless the therapist has the training and safeguards in place. The parent mentions that Karla said it's okay, but it's not clear if Karla has specific training in family therapy or if she's aware of the potential dynamics here.\n\nThe daughter's privacy is a big issue. Even though the parent might know a lot already, the daughter's trust in therapy relies on confidentiality. If the parent is part of the sessions, the daughter might feel less comfortable sharing, which could hinder her progress. The parent's argument that they can't find another trusted therapist is understandable, but it's not a reason to override the daughter's feelings.\n\nThe parent's comparison to a surgeon treating the whole family isn't quite the same. Surgeons don't typically share the same personal issues as their patients, and therapy involves more emotional and relational dynamics that could complicate things. The daughter's resistance might be more about feeling her privacy is invaded rather than being irrational.\n\nAdditionally, the parent wants to use this as a step toward family therapy, but the daughter already refuses to have sessions with the parent and spouse present. Forcing the parent to be under the same therapist might not help; it could make the daughter more resistant, damaging the therapeutic relationship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the therapist's approval might not be sufficient. The therapist might not realize the potential for conflict in a parent-child dynamic. Even if Karla is okay with it, the parent should consider the daughter's perspective and the potential long-term effects on their relationship and the daughter's therapy.\n\nSo, while the parent's intentions are good, the action of using the same therapist despite the daughter's objections could be seen as disregarding her autonomy and privacy. The answer would likely be that the parent is in the wrong (A) because they're not respecting the daughter's boundaries and the professional standards regarding dual relationships.\n"
