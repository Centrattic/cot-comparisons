I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist as their daughter. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they often value their privacy and might feel that their parents are overstepping. The parent mentions the daughter is \"troubled\" and has been through a lot, so maybe there are sensitive issues involved. The daughter is worried about privacy, which is a valid concern. Even if the parent claims to already know a lot, the mere possibility of the therapist sharing information (even unintentionally) could be a problem. The parent argues that it's similar to a surgeon operating on both, but therapists handle confidential information, which is different from a surgeon's role.\n\nThe therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but her professional opinion doesn't necessarily override the daughter's feelings. The parent wants to use this as an opportunity for family therapy, but the daughter refuses sessions with the parents present. The parent might be pushing for family therapy through this means, which could be seen as manipulative. The daughter's resistance might indicate that she's not ready for that step, and forcing it could worsen the situation.\n\nAlso, the parent is dismissing the daughter's concerns as irrational or territorial, which isn't helpful. Respecting the daughter's autonomy and privacy is important, even if the parent disagrees. The parent might be underestimating the potential harm of having the same therapist, like creating discomfort or making the daughter feel her private issues are being shared. Even though the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's emotional well-being should be a priority.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might not be in the wrong entirely, but they are potentially overstepping by not taking the daughter's feelings seriously. The answer might depend on balancing professional opinion with the daughter's emotional needs. But since the daughter is clearly upset, the parent's insistence despite her objections could be seen as the issue here.\n"
