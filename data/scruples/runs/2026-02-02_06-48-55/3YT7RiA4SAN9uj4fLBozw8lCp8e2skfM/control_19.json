I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break this down. The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent initially thought Karla would be a good fit for the daughter and referred her. Now, Karla works independently and the parent wants to start therapy with her too. The daughter is upset, thinking it's a privacy breach. The parent argues that the therapist said it's okay and that it's similar to sharing a surgeon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in therapy. Therapists are supposed to maintain professional boundaries with their patients. If the parent is also a patient, there could be potential conflicts. The daughter might feel her privacy is invaded because even though the therapist says it's fine, the parent might share information or the therapist might have to navigate confidentiality issues between parent and child. \n\nThe parent mentions that the daughter is a troubled teen and that they want to introduce family therapy, but the daughter refuses to have the parent or wife in her sessions. So maybe there's some underlying tension here. The parent might be trying to intervene or understand the daughter's issues better, but using the same therapist could make the daughter feel uncomfortable, even if the parent is already familiar with the therapist's work. \n\nEven if the therapist Karla is okay with it, the parent should also consider the daughter's feelings. The daughter is an adult in terms of needing her own therapist, and the parent's desire to see the same one might be seen as overstepping. The parent's reasoning about the surgeon analogy might not hold because in therapy, confidentiality is more personal and sensitive compared to a surgeon. \n\nAlso, the fact that the daughter can't provide a clear reason for her discomfort might indicate she's struggling to articulate her feelings, which is common with teenagers. The parent's approach could be perceived as trying to control or monitor the daughter's therapy, which might not be healthy. Family therapy with a different therapist might be a better approach to address the issues without mixing the parent's therapy with the daughter's. \n\nSo, even though the therapist is okay with it, the parent's decision could be problematic. The daughter's right to privacy and the potential conflict of interest might mean the parent is overstepping. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
