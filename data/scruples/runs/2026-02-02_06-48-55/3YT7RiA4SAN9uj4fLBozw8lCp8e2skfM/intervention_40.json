I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a parent (the author) who wants to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley, who is already a patient. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but the daughter is upset, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The author argues that the therapist is trustworthy and that there's no real issue beyond patient confidentiality, which they acknowledge. The daughter is a troubled teen and resists family therapy. The author wants to respect the daughter's feelings but also not reward what they see as territorial behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider professional ethics. Therapists usually have guidelines against seeing family members of their existing clients to avoid conflicts of interest and protect privacy. Even if Karla is okay with it, the American Psychological Association (APA) ethics code, for example, has strict rules about dual relationships. The therapist could be in a position where they might need to share information about the daughter to help the parent, or vice versa, which violates confidentiality.\n\nThen, from the daughter's perspective, she feels her privacy is being invaded. Even if the parent knows a lot already, therapy is a safe space for the daughter to discuss sensitive issues. If the parent is also a client, the daughter might feel less comfortable opening up, fearing that information could be shared or that the therapist might take sides. This could hinder the therapeutic process.\n\nThe parent's reasoning about family therapy is a good point, but the daughter refuses, so pushing to see the same therapist might not address the underlying issues. The parent is dismissing the daughter's concerns as irrational or territorial, which could be valid, but it's also possible that the daughter's feelings are legitimate and need to be validated.\n\nThe therapist's approval might be based on their own assessment, but professional guidelines are there for a reason. Even if Karla is okay, the potential for conflict and ethical violations could outweigh the benefits. The parent might not be considering the long-term impact on their relationship with their daughter and the effectiveness of her therapy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the therapist is okay with it, the parent's actions could breach the daughter's confidentiality and trust. The parent isn't respecting the daughter's autonomy and privacy to the extent that the daughter is entitled to in a therapeutic setting. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
