I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break this down. The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent, the author, met Karla through their military base hospital and sent Ashley to her. Now that Karla works independently, the author wants to start seeing her too. Ashley is upset about this, but Karla says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter might feel her privacy is being invaded. Even though the parent says they already know a lot, the daughter could feel that having the same therapist blurs boundaries. Therapists usually maintain confidentiality, but the daughter might not trust that Karla will keep her sessions separate. \n\nThe parent argues that it's like seeing the same surgeon, but therapy is different because it's more personal and relies on trust. The therapist might be okay with it, but the daughter's feelings are valid. The parent also mentions the daughter is \"troubled\" and refuses family therapy, so maybe they're trying to push for family sessions through this approach. However, forcing the daughter could cause more resistance. \n\nI should check if there are professional guidelines on therapists treating family members. I recall that it's generally discouraged because it can create conflicts of interest and compromise confidentiality. Even if Karla is okay with it, if the daughter is uncomfortable, it might not be ethical. The parent's intention might be to connect, but the daughter's privacy and comfort are important. \n\nSo, the parent might not be in the wrong per se, but they should respect the daughter's feelings more. The key points are the daughter's privacy concerns and the potential for blurred boundaries. The therapist's approval is there, but the daughter's consent is missing. The parent could be overstepping without considering the daughter's perspective. Therefore, the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they're disregarding the daughter's autonomy and privacy despite her objections.\n"
