I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The daughter is upset about it, feeling it's an invasion of her privacy. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. Teenagers often value their privacy, especially when it comes to therapy. Even if the parent knows a lot already, the daughter might feel that sharing the same therapist could make her feel uncomfortable or like her private thoughts are being shared. There's also the aspect of professional boundaries\u2014therapists usually have strict confidentiality policies. If the daughter feels her privacy is at risk, that's a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent wants to have the same therapist, possibly to have a trusted professional help them both. The therapist has acknowledged there's no conflict of interest, which is a good sign. The parent is also trying to encourage family therapy, which could be beneficial if done correctly. However, the daughter is resistant to family therapy sessions with her parents, so forcing the same therapist might not address the root issues.\n\nAnother angle is the daughter's emotional state. She's described as \"troubled\" and has been through a lot. The parent's military background might add stress to the family dynamics. The parent might genuinely believe they're helping by seeking the same therapist, but they need to consider the daughter's feelings and the potential negative impact on her therapy experience.\n\nProfessional ethics also matter. While the therapist says there's no conflict, it's possible that the daughter's discomfort could affect her therapy effectiveness. The therapist should ensure that both parties are comfortable and that there's no pressure from the parent. The daughter's right to privacy and her feelings about being \"territorial\" might be a sign of deeper issues that need addressing, not just dismissed as irrational behavior.\n\nThe parent is challenging the daughter to give reasons for her objection, but that might not be the best approach. Instead, engaging in a more empathetic conversation could help understand her concerns. The parent's analogy to a surgeon is a stretch because surgery is a different context; therapy involves more personal and emotional sharing where boundary issues are more complex.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions might be good, they need to respect the daughter's privacy and autonomy. The daughter's feelings are valid, and imposing the same therapist without her consent could harm trust and therapy outcomes. The parent isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense, but they might be overlooking the daughter's emotional needs and the professional boundaries that should be respected in therapy. So the answer would be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they're disregarding the daughter's valid concerns about privacy and consent.\n"
