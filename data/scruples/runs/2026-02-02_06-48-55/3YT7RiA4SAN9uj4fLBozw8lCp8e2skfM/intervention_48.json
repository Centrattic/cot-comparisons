I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter. The father, Ashley's parent, introduced her to the therapist, Karla, and now wants to become a patient too. The daughter is against it, citing privacy concerns. The therapist says there's no conflict, and the wife also thinks the father is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when privacy and autonomy are especially important. Even though the father knows a lot about her situation, the fact that the therapist is handling confidential information is key. The daughter's concern isn't just about the father knowing her day-to-day; it's about sensitive issues that might be discussed in therapy. The father might not realize the depth of privacy issues involved here.\n\nThe therapist's role is to maintain confidentiality between the client and the therapist. If the daughter feels that having her parent involved in the same therapist's practice breaches that trust, it could damage the therapeutic relationship. The father's argument about a skilled surgeon analogy might not hold because therapy isn't the same as surgery. In surgery, the surgeon isn't privy to personal details the same way a therapist is. The daughter's discomfort is valid, even if the therapist is okay with it. The therapist's professional opinion is important, but the daughter's consent and comfort matter in the therapeutic process.\n\nAlso, the father's intent to use this as an introduction to family therapy is a red flag. If the daughter is resistant to family therapy now, adding the parent into her current therapy might not be the right approach. It could be seen as pushing her boundaries rather than respecting her wishes. The father's dismissal of her anger as \"irrational or territorial behavior\" shows a lack of empathy. Teenagers often struggle with asserting their autonomy, and the father might be undermining that by pressing forward despite her objections.\n\nThe therapist's approval is a point in the father's favor, but the therapist's primary responsibility is to the client's well-being. If the daughter feels her privacy is compromised, the therapist should prioritize that. The fact that the daughter has been through a lot suggests that her needs for a safe, confidential space are critical. The father's military background and personal experiences don't equate to understanding the daughter's specific needs in this scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father's intention to seek help from a trusted therapist is understandable, the daughter's right to privacy and her feelings about the situation are paramount. The father overstepping by not respecting her boundaries and insisting on joining her therapy could indeed be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
