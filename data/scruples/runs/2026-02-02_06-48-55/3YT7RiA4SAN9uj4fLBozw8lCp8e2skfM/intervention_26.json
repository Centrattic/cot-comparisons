I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the daughter Ashley has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author, who's a parent, also wants to see Karla. Karla agrees, but Ashley is upset about it. The parent thinks it's similar to having the same surgeon and sees it as a way to start family therapy, but Ashley refuses family therapy sessions with her parents present.\n\nThe parent is trying to balance respecting Ashley's feelings but not giving in to what they see as her anger or territorial behavior. They mention that Karla, being the therapist, says it's fine. The parent is in the military, which adds context about their own stress and experiences.\n\nNow, the key points here: boundaries in therapy, confidentiality, and the daughter's emotional response. Therapists have strict confidentiality rules, and even though the parent knows some things, the daughter might feel her privacy is invaded. The daughter is a troubled teen, which could mean she's more sensitive about privacy. The therapist's approval is there, but the parent might be overlooking the daughter's emotional well-being by pushing this. \n\nThe parent's argument about the surgeon analogy might not hold because surgeons don't discuss patients' private matters with other family members, preserving confidentiality. Also, the daughter's refusal to have family therapy with parents suggests she needs more space, which the parent is ignoring by insisting on the same therapist. \n\nTherapeutic boundaries are important. Even if the therapist agrees, the daughter's discomfort is valid. The parent might be disregarding her feelings, which could worsen the daughter's trust issues. The parent's intention might be good, but the approach could be crossing a line. So, considering the daughter's emotional state and the importance of privacy, the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
