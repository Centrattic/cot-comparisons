I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author, the parent, now wants to see Karla too. Karla says it's okay, but Ashley is upset about it. The parent thinks they're not in the wrong, while the daughter and spouse think they are.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Therapy often involves confidentiality, so even if the parent is allowed to see the same therapist, there's a boundary issue. The daughter might feel her privacy is being invaded. The parent argues that they already know a lot and that it's like having the same surgeon. But therapy isn't surgery; it's more personal. The therapist's role is to maintain confidentiality, which is crucial for the patient's trust.\n\nThe therapist says it's okay, but the parent isn't considering the daughter's feelings. The daughter is a teenager, which can be a time of heightened sensitivity about privacy. The parent is dismissing her concerns as irrational or territorial, which might not be fair. The parent's desire to have family therapy is good, but forcing the daughter to accept seeing the same therapist against her will could be problematic. Even if Karla is comfortable, the daughter's consent is important here. The parent might not be respecting the daughter's autonomy and feelings of privacy. So, maybe the parent is in the wrong (A), but I need to check if there are professional ethics involved. Some ethics codes might prohibit a therapist from seeing a minor's parent if it could compromise the minor's therapy. But the parent is an adult, so maybe that's not the case. However, the daughter's privacy is still a key factor. The parent is prioritizing their own needs without considering the daughter's emotional state. So the answer might be A.\n"
