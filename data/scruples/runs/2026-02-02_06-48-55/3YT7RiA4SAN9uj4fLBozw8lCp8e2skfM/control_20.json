I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent, the author, thinks Karla is good and wants to see her too. But Ashley is against it, feeling it's an invasion of her privacy. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical guidelines for therapists. There are rules about confidentiality and boundaries. If a therapist is treating both a parent and child, there can be potential conflicts. The American Psychological Association (APA) has ethical standards that might cover this. For example, dual relationships can create conflicts of interest and may lead to exploitation or harm. Therapists are usually advised to avoid having multiple relationships with clients and their family members unless it's necessary and properly managed.\n\nIn the scenario, Karla, the therapist, says it's okay for the parent to see her too. But the daughter is uncomfortable. Even if the therapist thinks it's fine, the daughter's feelings about privacy are important. The daughter might feel that her private discussions with the therapist could be shared with her parent, even if confidentiality is maintained. The parent argues that they already know a lot and that it's like having the same surgeon. However, the context of a therapist is different because of confidentiality laws, but the perception of the patient matters.\n\nAlso, if the parent's main motivation is to get the daughter to do family therapy, that could complicate things. The daughter is already resistant to having family sessions. The parent might be using their own therapy as a way to push for that, which could be seen as manipulative. The daughter's privacy is a significant concern here, and even if the therapist is okay with it, the parent might not be considering the daughter's emotional well-being in terms of her trust in therapy.\n\nAnother angle: the parent is a military person, which adds a layer of authority. If the daughter feels pressured by the parent's decision, that could create a power dynamic that affects her willingness to engage in therapy. The therapist might have a conflict of interest if they need to manage both the parent's and child's needs, which could compromise the therapeutic relationship for both.\n\nSo, considering ethical guidelines, the potential for conflict of interest, and the daughter's privacy concerns, the answer might be that the parent is in the wrong because they're disregarding the daughter's feelings about privacy, which are valid. Even if the therapist says it's okay, the parent's actions could undermine the daughter's trust and the therapeutic process. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
