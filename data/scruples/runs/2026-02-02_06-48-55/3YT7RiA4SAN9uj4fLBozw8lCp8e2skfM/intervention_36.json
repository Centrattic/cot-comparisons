I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The father sent her to a group session with Karla when she was working at the base hospital. He later sent her to individual sessions. Now, Karla is independent and the father wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about it. The father thinks it's similar to having the same surgeon, arguing that it's not a problem if the therapist approves. The daughter feels it's a privacy breach, and the wife is on her side. The father also mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy with him and his wife present, so he sees this as a way to start family therapy.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's feelings about privacy and the therapist's approval. The father is in a military setting, so maybe there's some added pressure or different dynamics. The daughter is a teenager dealing with personal issues, which can make privacy a big deal. The therapist's okay with it, but the daughter isn't. The father is pushing back, saying that the therapist's professional opinion matters more. \n\nI need to consider therapeutic boundaries. Even if the therapist is okay with seeing both parent and child, the daughter's discomfort is valid. Therapy is a confidential space, and having a parent involved can make a teenager feel like their privacy is invaded. The father might not realize that the daughter's resistance is about her need for a safe, confidential space to discuss sensitive issues without parental oversight. \n\nAlso, the daughter's reaction could stem from feeling that the therapy is not her own anymore, which is common in teens. The father's argument about family therapy is valid, but maybe there's a different approach. The therapist might need to facilitate a discussion to address the daughter's concerns and see if both parties can agree on a way forward. However, the father is dismissing the daughter's reasons as territorial behavior, which could be a problem. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, therapists typically maintain boundaries between family members to prevent conflicts of interest. If the therapist is okay with both seeing her, but the daughter isn't, the father should respect that unless there's a compelling reason. The father's stance might be infringing on the daughter's autonomy. The fact that the daughter has been through a lot makes her need for a confidential space even more critical. \n\nSo, while the therapist's approval is a point in favor, the daughter's well-being and comfort should be prioritized. The father might not be \"wrong\" in wanting to seek therapy, but he's disregarding his daughter's feelings and the potential impact on her therapy. There's a balance between seeking help as a parent and respecting the child's therapeutic boundaries. The answer here might lean towards the father being in the wrong because he's not adequately considering his daughter's perspective and the importance of her confidentiality and comfort in therapy.\n"
