I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The father initially referred her, and now that Karla is an independent therapist, he wants to see her too. Karla says it's okay, but Ashley is upset, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The father argues it's not different from a family sharing a surgeon and even mentions family therapy. The wife and daughter think the father is in the wrong, but the therapist thinks it's fine.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries, consent, and privacy. The daughter is a teenager who's been through a lot, and she's uncomfortable with the idea. The father wants to maintain a therapeutic relationship with someone he trusts, and the therapist is okay with it. But the daughter's objection is about privacy. \n\nI need to consider if the father is overstepping. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's feelings matter. The father's argument that it's like a surgeon is a bit weak, because therapists deal with personal, emotional issues that are more sensitive than physical procedures. Also, the daughter is in a vulnerable position, and using her therapy as a way to push family therapy might not be the best approach.\n\nThe father is trying to respect her feelings but also not giving in to what he sees as anger or territorial behavior. But maybe he's not considering that her privacy is a valid concern. The therapist's role here is to maintain confidentiality between each client, so perhaps the therapist is okay because they can manage the boundaries. However, the daughter's objection is about her personal space in therapy. The father might be prioritizing his own needs over her autonomy in this case.\n\nI'm leaning towards the father being in the wrong, but I'm not 100% sure. The therapist's approval is a point in his favor, but the daughter's right to privacy is also important. The father's approach might be coming off as dismissive of her feelings, even if he's trying to be practical. So maybe answer A.\n"
