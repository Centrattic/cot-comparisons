I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Ashley, the daughter, is opposed to it, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The parent, however, has already discussed it with the therapist who said it's okay. The daughter is a troubled teenager, and the parent wants to use this as a step towards family therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is 18 or older? The scenario doesn't specify, but since she's in therapy independently, maybe she's an adult. However, the parent might still be involved in her care. The daughter's resistance could be about privacy and autonomy. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's feelings matter. The parent is trying to balance respect for her feelings with their own need for support, especially given their military background and the daughter's troubled history.\n\nTherapists usually maintain confidentiality, so the parent's argument that they already know a lot isn't valid in terms of confidentiality. The daughter might feel that having the same therapist could create a conflict in the therapeutic relationship, or that the therapist's attention is divided. The parent's comparison to a surgeon is a bit simplistic; therapy is different because it's more about trust and personal sharing. \n\nThe parent wants to do family therapy, but the daughter refuses. The therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's consent is also crucial. Even if the therapist is comfortable, the daughter's discomfort shouldn't be ignored. The parent is acting on their own wishes without fully considering the daughter's perspective, which might be seen as dismissive of her needs. \n\nThe parent is trying to use this as a way to engage in family therapy, but the daughter's refusal to have the parent or spouse present suggests she's not ready. Pushing against her resistance could backfire. While the parent has good intentions, they might not be respecting the daughter's autonomy and her right to her own therapeutic space. \n\nIn professional ethics, therapists might avoid dual relationships where it could impair objectivity. However, the therapist has already given consent, so maybe it's okay. But the daughter's feelings are valid. The parent might be in the right in terms of seeking support, but the approach could be problematic. It's a balance between their needs and the daughter's. The answer hinges on whether respecting the daughter's privacy and autonomy takes precedence over the parent's desire for shared therapy. Given that, the parent might be in the wrong for not adequately respecting the daughter's boundaries.\n"
