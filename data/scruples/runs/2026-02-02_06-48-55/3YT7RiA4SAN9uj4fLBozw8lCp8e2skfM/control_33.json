I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The key points here are that the parent (the author) wants to see the same therapist as their daughter, who is already seeing her. The therapist, Karla, doesn't see a conflict of interest and is okay with it. However, the daughter, Ashley, is upset about it, thinking it's a breach of privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical guidelines for therapists. In many places, therapists aren't supposed to have dual relationships with their clients, which could include relationships with family members. If the therapist is treating both the parent and the child, that could create a conflict of interest. Even if Karla says it's okay, there might be ethical issues she's not considering. The therapist might need to maintain professional boundaries to avoid any potential harm or bias in their treatment. \n\nThen there's the daughter's perspective. She might feel her privacy is being invaded because sharing information with a therapist is supposed to be confidential. The parent might argue they already know a lot, but patient confidentiality is a key part of therapy. The daughter's refusal to have family therapy sessions suggests she doesn't want her parent involved in her therapy process. The parent wants to use this as a way to do family therapy, but the daughter isn't on board.\n\nThe parent's reasoning includes comparing it to a surgeon treating multiple family members, but therapy isn't the same as surgery. The therapeutic relationship is more about trust and confidentiality. The therapist might be putting themselves in a position where they have to navigate confidentiality between two family members, which could lead to complications. \n\nAlso, the daughter's anger and the parent's dismissal of it as \"territorial behavior\" might be problematic. The parent should respect the daughter's feelings, especially since she's been through a lot. The daughter's privacy is a valid concern, and the parent might be overstepping by not acknowledging her boundaries. \n\nThe therapist's approval might not be sufficient if they're not fully aware of the potential dual relationship issues. Ethical guidelines often advise against such situations to prevent conflicts. The parent's insistence despite the daughter's objections could harm their relationship and the daughter's trust in the therapeutic process.\n\nIn summary, the parent might be in the wrong by not respecting the daughter's privacy and potentially breaching ethical therapy standards. The therapist's agreement doesn't invalidate the daughter's concerns. The answer is likely AITA, so the correct response would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
