I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The situation is that Ashley is uncomfortable with this, but the therapist, Karla, thinks it's fine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of a therapist seeing both a parent and their child. In therapy, confidentiality is a big deal. If the therapist is seeing both, there might be potential conflicts. Even though Karla says it's okay, maybe there are standard professional guidelines that advise against dual relationships? I remember that in therapy, dual relationships can create ethical issues because the therapist might have to navigate confidentiality boundaries carefully. For example, if the parent and child have issues between them, the therapist might be in a tough spot if they have to keep secrets from one party to protect the other.\n\nThen there's Ashley's perspective. She's a teenager who's already troubled and has privacy concerns. Even if the parent thinks they know a lot, the daughter might feel violated or that her private matters are being shared. The parent dismisses her concerns as irrational or territorial, but teens often have valid reasons for feeling that way, even if they can't articulate them well. The parent's analogy of a surgeon treating both is a bit simplistic because surgeons don't have the same confidentiality rules as therapists. Surgeons might discuss medical details, but therapists deal with sensitive personal information.\n\nThe parent wants to use this as a way into family therapy, but Ashley refuses sessions with family present. Insisting on seeing the same therapist might not address the underlying issues and could strain the parent-daughter relationship further. The wife is also against it, which adds another layer of family tension.\n\nSo, while the therapist's approval is there, the ethical guidelines might caution against it. The parent's dismissal of the daughter's feelings could be seen as not respecting her autonomy and privacy. Even if the parent has good intentions, the potential for harm exists. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're disregarding their daughter's feelings and possibly violating ethical therapy practices.\n"
