I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent introduced her to Karla through a group session. Now Karla works independently and both the parent and daughter are considering seeing her. The parent checked with Karla, who said it's okay. The parent wants to use this as a way to start family therapy since the daughter refuses to have sessions with the parent and wife present.\n\nThe daughter is upset about privacy. The parent argues that they already know a lot and that patient confidentiality is a thing. They also compare it to a surgeon treating multiple family members. The daughter is a troubled teen, and the parent is trying to address family issues through therapy.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and the daughter's feelings. While the therapist says it's okay, the parent is disregarding the daughter's concerns. Even if the parent has good intentions, forcing the issue might make the daughter feel her privacy isn't respected. The daughter's resistance to family therapy suggests she's uncomfortable, which the parent is trying to bypass by using the same therapist. This could create a power dynamic where the parent isn't respecting the daughter's autonomy. The parent might be overstepping by not taking the daughter's feelings seriously and pushing their own agenda, even if the therapist approves. So, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
