I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. So, the parent, Ashley, has a therapist named Karla. The parent introduced Karla to their daughter, and now Karla is the daughter's therapist. Now the parent wants to become a client of Karla too. The daughter is upset about it, saying it's a breach of privacy, but the parent argues that Karla is a trusted therapist and that it's similar to having a surgeon operate on both of them. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Therapists have ethical guidelines. The American Psychological Association (APA) has guidelines about dual relationships, which can include having a therapeutic relationship with a patient's family member. However, if the therapist determines that it's manageable and doesn't compromise the therapy, it might be acceptable. The therapist here, Karla, said it's fine, so maybe she's aware of the guidelines and thinks it's okay.\n\nBut then there's the daughter's perspective. She feels her privacy is being invaded. Even if the parent knows some things already, the daughter might feel uncomfortable knowing the therapist shares information or that the parent is also being counseled by the same person. There's also the potential for boundary issues. If the parent and daughter are both seeing the same therapist, the therapist might have to navigate multiple roles, which could be complex. The parent wants to do family therapy, but the daughter refuses, so maybe this is a way to get around that.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that Karla is the only therapist they trust and that the daughter's reasons are irrational. But the daughter's concern about privacy is valid. Even if the parent argues confidentiality, the daughter might feel that the therapist is now part of both their lives, which could blur the therapeutic boundaries. The parent also mentions challenging the daughter to give reasons against it, but maybe the daughter's reasons are about emotional comfort and trust rather than logical arguments.\n\nI should also consider the military aspect mentioned\u2014maybe the family has faced unique stressors, leading the parent to seek a trusted therapist. However, the daughter's reaction could stem from her own experiences and need for autonomy. The parent's approach might be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter is a teenager seeking independence. The parent might not be respecting the daughter's autonomy by pushing this, even if the therapist approves.\n\nIn summary, while the therapist agrees, the daughter's privacy and emotional needs are significant. The parent might be prioritizing their own desire for a shared therapist over the daughter's comfort, which could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. However, the therapist's approval complicates things. But generally, respecting the patient's (daughter's) feelings about privacy is crucial. So the parent might be in the wrong here.\n"
