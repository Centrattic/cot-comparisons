I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley.\n\nFirst, the therapist, Karla, is already seeing Ashley. The author approached Karla and she agreed it's okay for them to be her patient too. That's a good point because the therapist is the professional here, and she's not against it. The daughter, Ashley, is upset about privacy, but the parent argues that they already know a lot and that patient confidentiality is a thing. The parent also mentions that Ashley isn't giving a solid reason for her objection besides privacy, which is valid. The parent wants to use this as a way to start family therapy since Ashley won't have sessions with the parent or spouse present.\n\nNow, considering the daughter's perspective: teenagers can be very protective of their privacy, especially if they're going through a hard time. Even if the parent knows a lot, the fact that they're sharing a therapist might make Ashley feel like her trust is being compromised. Therapists are supposed to create a safe space, and if Ashley feels her privacy is at risk, that could hinder her progress. The therapist's role here is crucial because they need to maintain boundaries for both patients. If the parent is seen as overstepping, it could damage the therapeutic relationship for Ashley. However, the therapist does think it's okay, which suggests there's a professional judgment here. \n\nBut wait, even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's feelings are valid. The parent is dismissing Ashley's concerns by saying she can't give a good reason, but maybe the reason is just that she's uncomfortable. The parent is also trying to push for family therapy, which could be a good idea, but the approach might come off as forcing the issue, which isn't helpful. The parent might not be considering Ashley's emotional state and the importance of her feeling safe in therapy. \n\nSo, while the therapist's approval is important, the parent needs to balance their own needs with respecting Ashley's privacy and emotional well-being. Overstepping could lead to Ashley feeling that her therapy is not a private space, which is a big deal. The parent's argument about the surgeon analogy might not hold because therapy is different from surgery in terms of privacy and trust dynamics. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent might not be in the wrong entirely because they're seeking help and the therapist approved, but they might be ignoring Ashley's valid privacy concerns. So the answer could be a bit nuanced, but since the options are A or B, and the parent is pushing despite the daughter's discomfort, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) for not respecting Ashley's feelings enough.\n"
