I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The parent, Ashley's parent, started the daughter with therapist Karla, and now wants to see her too. The daughter is upset, thinking it invades her privacy. The parent argues that Karla is the only therapist they trust and that the therapist says it's okay.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, which can be a tough age with a lot of emotional changes. She might feel her privacy is being invaded, even if the parent is well-meaning. The parent mentions the therapist isn't opposed, but the daughter is. The parent is pushing back, saying they don't want to reward what they see as irrational behavior or territorialism. But is the daughter's reaction actually irrational? Privacy is important in therapy, especially for teens who might feel vulnerable. If the therapist is handling both, there could be potential conflicts in sessions or the daughter feeling monitored.\n\nThe parent also wants to avoid giving in to the daughter's anger. But maybe the daughter's feelings are valid. The parent is using an analogy to a surgeon, but therapy is different. It's more about personal emotions and trust. If the daughter isn't comfortable, the parent might need to respect that. Also, the parent mentions the daughter refuses family therapy, so bringing in the same therapist doesn't solve that. Maybe the parent should find another therapist for themselves to protect the daughter's privacy, even if Karla is willing. The therapist's professional opinion is one thing, but the daughter's comfort is another. The parent might not be in the wrong entirely, but maybe they should prioritize the daughter's feelings here. So, the answer might be A, but I need to be careful. The parent is trying to be supportive, but the daughter's right to privacy is a key point. So maybe the parent is in the wrong for not respecting her feelings enough.\n"
