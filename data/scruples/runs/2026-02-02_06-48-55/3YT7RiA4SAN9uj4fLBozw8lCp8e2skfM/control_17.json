I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter. From the story, the daughter (Ashley) has been seeing Karla for a year, and the father now wants to see her too. He mentions that Karla is the only therapist he trusts, and she's agreed to see him. However, the daughter is upset about this, feeling it's a breach of privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. Teenagers, especially those in therapy, might feel their privacy is invaded if their parent starts seeing the same therapist. Even if the father knows some aspects of her life, there's the aspect of confidentiality. The therapist-patient relationship is supposed to be confidential, and sharing the therapist with a family member could make the daughter feel uncomfortable. The father argues that it's similar to having the same surgeon, but therapy is different because it's more personal and relies on trust and confidentiality.\n\nThen there's the therapist's viewpoint. Karla has agreed to see the father, which suggests she's professionally okay with it. However, therapists have ethical guidelines to follow. The American Psychological Association has standards about conflicts of interest. If the therapist is seeing both parent and child, there could be potential issues with dual relationships, which might create bias or affect the therapy dynamics. The father should check if Karla's agreement is in line with these ethical standards.\n\nThe father also wants to use this as a way into family therapy, but the daughter refuses. If Karla is okay with it, maybe there's a way to approach family therapy without making the daughter feel pressured. The daughter's resistance might mean that the father's approach isn't the right one right now, even if the therapist is okay with it.\n\nThe daughter's reaction is important. She's a troubled teen, and her anger might be justified if she feels her privacy is being invaded. The father might be dismissing her feelings by calling it irrational or territorial behavior, but that could be undermining her legitimate concerns about confidentiality and autonomy.\n\nIn summary, while the therapist is on board, the daughter's right to privacy and the potential ethical issues need to be considered. The father's decision could be seen as disregarding his daughter's boundaries, which might place him in the wrong. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
