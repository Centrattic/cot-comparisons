I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The parent argues that they already know a lot about their daughter's issues and that the therapist is the only one they trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, and even if she's troubled, her feelings about privacy are valid. Therapy is a safe space, and sharing with a parent might make her uncomfortable. The parent mentions that the daughter can't give a reason beyond privacy, but the parent dismisses that. The daughter might feel her autonomy is being invaded.\n\nThen there's the therapist's role. Karla says it's okay, but the parent is now a client too. Could this create a conflict of interest? Even if the therapist thinks it's fine, there might be professional boundaries at stake. The therapist needs to maintain objectivity and ensure both clients' confidentiality and comfort. If the daughter feels uncomfortable, the therapist might have a harder time building trust with her. Also, if the parent and daughter attend sessions separately, the therapist has to manage both relationships without mixing them, which could be complex.\n\nThe parent wants family therapy but the daughter refuses. Maybe the daughter's resistance is a sign of deeper issues that need addressing, but forcing family therapy by having the same therapist might not help. The parent is using a comparison to a surgeon, but therapy isn't the same as surgery. Privacy and trust are more critical in therapy. The parent's approach might undermine the daughter's trust in the therapist.\n\nThe parent might be right in wanting support from a trusted therapist, but not at the expense of the daughter's comfort. The therapist's approval doesn't negate the daughter's feelings. The parent should respect her privacy and perhaps seek another therapist. It's possible the parent isn't wrong entirely, but the way they're handling the situation could be problematic. They might need to find a balance between their needs and their daughter's boundaries.\n"
