I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, thinking it's a breach of privacy. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The parent feels the daughter's objection is irrational or territorial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She might feel that her private sessions are being invaded. Even if the parent claims to already know a lot, the therapist-patient relationship is supposed to be confidential. The parent is trying to access the same therapist, which could create a conflict of interest. The daughter's resistance could be valid because she might fear that her private issues aren't truly private anymore. Teens often struggle with autonomy and boundaries, so her reaction might stem from a desire for independence.\n\nThe therapist's role is to maintain confidentiality. If the therapist starts seeing the parent, there's a risk that the daughter's information might be indirectly shared, even if unintentionally. The therapist might not be able to fully protect the daughter's privacy if the parent and daughter are both clients. The therapist's approval might be based on their own assessment, but family dynamics can complicate that. The parent assumes the therapist knows best, but the therapist's perspective might not account for the daughter's emotional response.\n\nThe parent mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy, which is a different approach. By pushing to see the same therapist, the parent might be trying to force a situation that the daughter isn't ready for. The daughter's anger could be a valid reaction to feeling her privacy is threatened. The parent's argument about a skilled surgeon is an analogy, but therapy isn't the same as surgery. The emotional and psychological aspects here require different considerations.\n\nAlso, the parent's justification that they already know a lot doesn't negate the daughter's right to privacy. The parent's military experience might influence their approach to authority and decision-making, but the daughter's needs in therapy should be the priority. The parent's desire to not reward \"territorial behavior\" might be overlooking the daughter's legitimate concerns about privacy and autonomy.\n\nSo, even though the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's feelings and the potential breach of confidentiality suggest that the parent's actions could be problematic. The parent might not be respecting the daughter's boundaries, which is a key aspect of healthy relationships. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
