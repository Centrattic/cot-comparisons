I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but Ashley is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the daughter is a teenager who's been through a lot and is seeing a therapist for help. The parent wants to see the same therapist, maybe to model behavior or get support for their own mental health. The therapist isn't against it, which is a point in the parent's favor. But the daughter feels her privacy is being invaded. \n\nTeenagers often value their independence and privacy, especially when dealing with personal issues. Even though the parent might know a lot about her life, the daughter's therapy sessions are confidential. The parent's argument about it being like a surgeon treating both of them is a bit of a stretch. Therapy isn't the same as surgery; confidentiality is a key part of the therapeutic relationship. The daughter might feel that having her parent as a client of the same therapist could compromise the trust she has with the therapist. \n\nThe parent mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy, so maybe they think this is a way to start. But forcing the parent to see the same therapist might not be the right approach. The daughter's feelings of being \"territorial\" or angry shouldn't be ignored. The parent is dismissing her concerns by challenging her to give reasons, but that might not validate her feelings properly. \n\nIn professional ethics, therapists usually avoid dual relationships where they have more than one role with a client. However, in this case, the therapist is seeing two separate clients. If the therapist is comfortable and there's no conflict of interest, maybe it's okay. But the daughter's distress is a red flag. The parent needs to consider the daughter's mental health and whether this could exacerbate her issues. \n\nSo, the parent's intent is good, but they might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's boundaries. The daughter's privacy is important, even if the parent knows a lot. The answer might hinge on whether the parent is respecting the daughter's autonomy versus their own needs. The therapist's approval doesn't negate the daughter's feelings, which are valid. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong here.\n"
