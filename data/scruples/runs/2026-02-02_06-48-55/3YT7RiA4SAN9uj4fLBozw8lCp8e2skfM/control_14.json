I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the father) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as his daughter.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter has been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The father met Karla through the on-base hospital, thought she was good for his daughter, and she's now working independently. The daughter is upset because he wants to see Karla too. The father thinks the therapist said it's okay, and he wants to do family therapy since the daughter refuses to have sessions with family present. The wife and daughter think he's in the wrong (TA), but he thinks he's not (NTA).\n\nSo, what are the key points here? Confidentiality is a big one. Therapists have professional boundaries, and having multiple family members in the same therapist's practice could complicate confidentiality. The daughter feels her privacy is breached. But the therapist says it's okay. The father argues that it's similar to seeing the same surgeon, implying the same skilled provider is okay. However, therapy is different from surgery because of the confidentiality aspect.\n\nThe daughter is resistant to family therapy. Maybe the father is pushing this to get closer or to address family issues, but the daughter is in a vulnerable state. The therapist's approval is mentioned, but maybe the therapist didn't consider all dynamics. For example, the therapist might not realize how the daughter feels or the potential for conflict.\n\nAnother angle: The daughter is a teenager, which is a time of seeking independence. She might feel that her private issues are being invaded. Even if the father isn't seeing her for the same reasons, having the same therapist could make her feel like her privacy is violated. The father might not fully grasp her perspective, thinking he's just getting help, not realizing the emotional impact on her.\n\nThe father's wife agrees with the daughter, suggesting that the family's opinion is divided. The father might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's feelings. Even if the therapist allows it, it's possible that the daughter's discomfort is valid, and the father should listen more to her concerns rather than challenging her to give reasons. The mention of \"territorial behavior\" might be dismissive of her actual valid reasons.\n\nBut the father's intention is to seek help and maybe improve family dynamics. However, forcing the same therapist could backfire if the daughter feels her privacy is invaded. Therapists also have ethical guidelines; if the daughter objects, the therapist might need to assess if continuing with both could be a conflict. Even if the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's consent might be a factor.\n\nIn conclusion, while the father's intentions might be good, respecting the daughter's privacy and her feelings is crucial. The therapist's approval might not override the daughter's valid privacy concerns. The father might be in the wrong if he's not adequately addressing her feelings and pushing forward despite her objections.\n"
