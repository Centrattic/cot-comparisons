I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author (the parent) introduced her to the therapist, initially through a group session. Now that Karla is independent, the parent wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about it, citing privacy concerns. The parent argues that the therapist would manage confidentiality and that it's similar to a surgeon treating multiple family members. The parent also wants to use this as a step toward family therapy, which the daughter refuses.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the parent's intent to seek their own therapy with the same provider, the daughter's privacy concerns, and the therapist's approval. \n\nThe parent is looking for validation from the community (the AITA platform) but the user (me) is supposed to decide if they're in the wrong. \n\nTherapists have ethical guidelines. In many jurisdictions, therapists can see multiple family members if there's no conflict of interest and it's handled with proper boundaries. The therapist in this case has already agreed, which suggests she's comfortable managing it. However, the daughter's feelings are important here. Even if the therapist thinks it's okay, if the daughter is distressed, the parent needs to consider that. \n\nThe parent mentions the daughter is a \"troubled\" teen and wants to use this as a step toward family therapy, which the daughter refuses. The parent is trying to push through this by saying they don't want to reward the daughter's anger. But maybe the daughter's resistance is valid because of privacy. The parent might be underestimating the daughter's need for confidentiality, even if they know some things already. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent has their own reasons to seek therapy, which is a personal right. However, the parent should also respect the daughter's boundaries unless there's a compelling reason to override them. The therapist's approval is part of it, but the parent's actions affect the daughter's trust. If the daughter feels her privacy is invaded, it could damage their relationship and her willingness to engage in therapy.\n\nIn therapy ethics, maintaining client confidentiality is key. If the therapist is handling both, she must ensure that information isn't shared without consent. The parent might trust that, but the daughter doesn't. The parent is dismissing the daughter's concerns as irrational or territorial, which could be a mistake. Teenagers might push back against parental decisions for various reasons, including a desire for autonomy.\n\nSo, while the parent's intention to seek therapy isn't wrong, the way they're handling the daughter's resistance and the potential breach of privacy might be. The parent isn't considering the daughter's perspective adequately. The daughter's privacy is a valid concern, and the parent's dismissal of her feelings could be harmful. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the parent should prioritize the daughter's comfort and trust in the therapeutic relationship.\n\nTherefore, the parent might be in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's boundaries despite the therapist's approval. It's a balance between personal rights and respecting others' privacy, especially in a therapeutic setting.\n"
