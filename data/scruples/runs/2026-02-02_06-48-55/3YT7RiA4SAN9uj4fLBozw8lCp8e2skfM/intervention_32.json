I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter is upset about this, but the therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The author is a military parent, and the daughter, Ashley, started seeing Karla through a military hospital program. Now Karla works independently, and the author wants to be her patient too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in therapy. Therapists usually have rules about treating family members of existing clients. That's because there can be conflicts of interest, confidentiality issues, and potential for boundary violations. Even if Karla says it's okay, the ethical guidelines for therapists, like those from the APA, typically advise against it. So maybe the therapist isn't acting appropriately, but the author might not know that.\n\nThen there's the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, which is a time of forming independence, and she's already troubled. She might feel her privacy is invaded, even if the parent knows a lot already. The parent mentions patient confidentiality, which is a key part of therapy. If the therapist shares information between the parent and the daughter, that could breach the daughter's trust. The parent might not realize that even if the therapist agrees, the daughter's comfort is crucial for effective therapy.\n\nThe parent wants to do family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with the parents present. However, forcing the daughter under the guise of family therapy could backfire. The daughter's resistance might stem from feeling her autonomy is threatened. The parent's argument about a surgeon is a stretch\u2014there's a difference between a medical procedure and therapy sessions where personal issues are discussed.\n\nAlso, the parent is challenging the daughter to give a reason why this is wrong, which might be dismissing the daughter's legitimate concerns. The daughter's anger could be about losing control over her personal space. The parent's approach might be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter isn't in a place where shared therapy is beneficial.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to seek help, which is commendable. But the method\u2014using the same therapist\u2014might not be the best. The therapist's approval doesn't override the ethical boundaries. The parent should consider finding another therapist for themselves to respect the daughter's privacy and maintain the integrity of both therapeutic relationships.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent might be in the wrong because they're disregarding the daughter's privacy concerns and possibly violating therapy ethics by sharing the same therapist. Even if the therapist agrees, the parent's action could undermine the daughter's therapy and her trust.\n"
