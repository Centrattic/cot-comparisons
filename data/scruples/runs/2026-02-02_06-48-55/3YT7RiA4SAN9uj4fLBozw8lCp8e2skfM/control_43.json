I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The parent provided a detailed account of the situation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent introduced Karla to Ashley when Karla worked at the military hospital. Now Karla has her own practice. The parent wants to see Karla too, and Karla is okay with it. However, Ashley is against it, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that there's no real issue except for what's confidential, and they even compare it to a surgeon treating both. The parent wants to start family therapy since Ashley refuses to do sessions with them. The wife and daughter think the parent is in the wrong, but the therapist says it's fine.\n\nSo, the main points are: the therapist approves, but the daughter is upset about privacy. The parent is trying to balance respecting Ashley's feelings and addressing her resistance. The parent's reasoning is that they can't access confidential info, and they think it's a good step for family therapy. The daughter is a troubled teen, which might make her more sensitive about privacy.\n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Normally, therapists might avoid treating close family members of existing clients to prevent conflicts of interest, even if the client approves. However, Karla has assessed the situation and agreed it's okay. But the daughter's objection is valid because she might feel her privacy is being invaded. The parent is pushing through the daughter's objections, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The parent might not be considering that the daughter's anger could be a legitimate reaction to feeling her autonomy is being undermined. The parent's comparison to a surgeon might not hold because therapy often involves sensitive personal issues, not just medical procedures. Also, family therapy requires all parties' consent, and if the daughter is resistant, forcing it might not be effective. The parent's approach could be seen as overstepping, especially if they are prioritizing their own needs over the daughter's boundaries. So, while the therapist is okay with it, the parent's insistence without addressing the daughter's concerns properly might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA being the parent.\n"
