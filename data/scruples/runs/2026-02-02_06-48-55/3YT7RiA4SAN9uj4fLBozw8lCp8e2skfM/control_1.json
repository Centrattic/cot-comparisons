I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me start by going through the details provided.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The author introduced her to the therapist when she worked at the on-base hospital. The daughter liked the group sessions and transitioned to one-on-one. Now Dr. Karla works independently, and the author wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about privacy. The author thinks it's similar to a surgeon treating multiple family members and wants to try family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with the parents.\n\nHmm. The daughter is a teenager, which can be a time of heightened sensitivity about privacy. Even though the author knows a lot about her life, the daughter might feel that having the same therapist could lead to shared information or a loss of confidentiality. The therapist's role is to maintain boundaries, and while Dr. Karla has approved it, maybe the daughter's discomfort is valid. The author is pushing back, seeing it as irrational, but maybe the daughter has legitimate concerns about being in a power dynamic where her parent is also a client. \n\nAlso, family therapy could be a different setting than both seeing the same therapist individually. If the daughter is resistant to family therapy, then having the parent see the same individual therapist might not be the best approach. The author might be dismissing the daughter's feelings as just teenage behavior, but it's possible the daughter's privacy is a real issue here.\n\nProfessional guidelines usually discourage dual relationships where a therapist has two clients in the same family to avoid conflicts of interest. Even if Dr. Karla thinks it's okay, there might be ethical considerations. The daughter's privacy is protected by confidentiality laws, and even though the author knows some things, the daughter might fear that shared information could be indirectly discussed. \n\nThe author's reasoning about a surgeon is a bit of a comparison, but medical and therapeutic relationships have different dynamics. Surgeons don't typically share detailed personal information about their patients' mental health in the same way. \n\nSo, considering the daughter's feelings and the potential ethical issues, the author might not be in the wrong, but their approach could be problematic. They need to respect the daughter's privacy concerns and maybe seek another therapist for themselves. The therapist's approval is one factor, but the daughter's comfort is crucial for her ongoing therapy. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they're not adequately respecting the daughter's privacy concerns despite the therapist's approval.\n"
