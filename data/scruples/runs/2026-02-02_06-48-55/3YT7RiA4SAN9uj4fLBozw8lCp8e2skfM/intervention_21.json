I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter objects, thinking it's a privacy issue, but the therapist says it's okay. The author feels like they're justified because the therapist is professional and the therapist hasn't seen any problems with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager who's already going through some issues. She might feel that her privacy is being invaded if her parent is also seeing the same therapist. Even if the therapist is professional, the daughter could feel uncomfortable knowing her parent is involved in her therapy sessions. Therapy is a confidential space, and sharing the same therapist might make her less likely to open up, especially since she's \"troubled\" and might need to discuss sensitive topics.\n\nThe author mentions that the therapist said there's no conflict of interest, but the daughter's feelings are valid. The author argues that the therapist is a skilled professional, comparing it to a surgeon treating both family members, but that's a different context. Surgeons don't typically share patients in the same way therapists do, especially when it comes to psychological and emotional issues where confidentiality is crucial.\n\nThe daughter's objection is about privacy, which is a legitimate concern. Even if the parent is already aware of some issues, the patient-therapist confidentiality is a key part of therapy's effectiveness. If the daughter feels her privacy is compromised, she might not trust the therapist as much, which could affect her therapy outcomes.\n\nThe author also wants to use this as a way to start family therapy, but the daughter refuses that already. Forcing the issue might lead to more resistance. The daughter's anger might not just be about the therapist but about a lack of control or autonomy. The parent's approach might be seen as dismissive of her feelings, treating her anger as irrational when it's actually a reasonable response to privacy concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is trying to be involved and support their daughter, which is understandable. But the method of using the same therapist might not be the best approach. The therapist's approval is important, but the daughter's comfort and willingness to engage in therapy are equally important. If the daughter feels coerced or that her privacy is invaded, it could backfire.\n\nSo, while the parent's intentions are good, the action of using the same therapist without considering the daughter's valid privacy concerns might be in the wrong. The parent should respect the daughter's feelings and perhaps seek a different therapist for themselves to preserve the daughter's trust and the effectiveness of her therapy.\n"
