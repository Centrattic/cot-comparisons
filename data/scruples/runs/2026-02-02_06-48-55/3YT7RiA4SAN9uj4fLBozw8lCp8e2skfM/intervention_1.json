I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a daughter, Ashley, who's been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent, the author, is now interested in seeing Karla too, but Ashley is against it, citing privacy concerns. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent wants to have the same therapist as their child, which could be seen as a way to understand each other better or to have family therapy. But the daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they often value independence and privacy. The parent mentions that the daughter is troubled and has been through a lot, so maybe the daughter feels vulnerable and doesn't want her parent to know everything from her therapy sessions.\n\nThe parent argues that the therapist said it's okay and that there's a professional opinion backing it. However, the daughter is clearly uncomfortable. The parent also compares it to being operated on by the same surgeon, implying that having the same therapist is just as logical. But that analogy might not hold because therapy is more personal and involves emotional issues that surgery doesn't. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, boundaries are important in therapy. Even though the parent is allowed to see the same therapist, the daughter's feelings of privacy and autonomy are significant. The parent might be overstepping by pushing this, especially if the daughter is resistant. The parent's motivation to not reward irrational behavior or anger could be valid, but forcing the issue might damage the daughter's trust.\n\nAlso, the daughter's refusal to have family therapy with the parent and wife present suggests that she might not be ready for that level of openness. The parent's desire to use this as a way into family therapy might not be the right approach if the daughter is not on board. \n\nOn the other hand, the therapist's approval is a point in favor. But the therapist's perspective is professional, and the daughter's emotional response is personal. The parent might not be in the wrong if they believe it's the right step, but they need to respect the daughter's boundaries more. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent's actions might be seen as disregarding the daughter's privacy and autonomy, even if they have good intentions. The daughter's right to privacy in therapy is important, and pushing against her wishes could be the parent's mistake. Therefore, the answer would be A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
