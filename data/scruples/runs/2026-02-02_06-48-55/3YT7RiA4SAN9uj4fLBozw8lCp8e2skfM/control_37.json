I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist that their daughter is seeing. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but the daughter is upset, thinking it's a breach of privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Therapists usually have boundaries about treating multiple people from the same family to avoid conflicts of interest. But in this case, the therapist has already agreed, so maybe she's comfortable. However, the daughter's feelings are important too. She's a teenager who's been through a lot, and she's worried about privacy. The parent is pushing back, saying they want family therapy but the daughter refuses sessions with the parents present. \n\nThe parent argues that the therapist's approval is enough, but the daughter's discomfort is valid. Even though the therapist says it's okay, maybe the parent isn't respecting the daughter's emotional needs. The daughter's argument about privacy is valid because therapy is confidential. The parent might be overstepping by wanting to share the same therapist, especially since the daughter is resistant. The parent mentions the surgeon analogy, but therapy isn't the same as surgery; confidentiality and the therapeutic relationship are different. \n\nThe daughter's anger could be a reaction to feeling that her privacy is violated. Even if the parent isn't legally wrong, they might be emotionally neglecting the daughter's feelings. The therapist might not have considered the daughter's perspective when agreeing. So, even if the therapist is okay with it, the parent's action could be seen as disregarding the daughter's autonomy and privacy. \n\nThe parent wants to use the therapist as a bridge to family therapy, but the daughter isn't ready for that. Insisting might be pushing too hard. The daughter's refusal to have family therapy sessions suggests she doesn't feel safe or comfortable. The parent might not be respecting that boundary, which could be harmful. \n\nIn conclusion, while the therapist's approval is there, the parent's actions could be seen as ignoring the daughter's valid concerns about privacy and emotional safety. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong.\n"
