I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author introduced her to Karla through a military hospital connection and now Karla is independent. The author wants to see Karla too, but Ashley is upset, thinking it's a privacy breach. The author argues that Karla agreed it's okay and sees no issue, and the author wants to do family therapy since Ashley refuses to have sessions with them present.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are privacy, consent, and professional boundaries. The daughter is a teenager, which complicates things because she's in a vulnerable stage. Even though the author might have good intentions, sharing the same therapist could make Ashley feel her privacy is invaded. Teenagers often value their privacy, especially in therapy settings where they discuss personal issues. Even if the author is allowed to see Karla, the daughter's comfort is important. Karla agreeing doesn't necessarily mean it's the best for Ashley. The author might be overlooking Ashley's feelings for their own needs. Also, family therapy is a good idea, but doing it with the same therapist might not be the right approach. The author's argument about the surgeon analogy might not hold because therapy is different from surgery. The daughter's resistance is valid, and the author pushing despite that could be seen as dismissive. So, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting Ashley's privacy and feelings.\n"
