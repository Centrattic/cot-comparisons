I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The daughter has been seeing a therapist named Karla for a year. The parent, who I'll call the author, used to work with Karla through the military hospital and recommended her to their daughter. The daughter liked Karla and started seeing her one-on-one. Now, Karla is an independent therapist with a good reputation. The author wants to see Karla too, and Karla is okay with it. However, the daughter is upset, thinking it breaches her privacy. The author argues that they already know a lot and that patient confidentiality applies. They also want to use this as a way to introduce family therapy since the daughter resists sessions with family present.\n\nThe daughter's concerns about privacy are a key point. Even though the author knows a lot, the daughter feels it's a violation. Privacy in therapy is crucial because it's a safe space. If the daughter feels her privacy is at risk, that could undermine her trust in the therapist. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but the daughter's opposition is significant. \n\nThe author is trying to balance respecting the daughter's feelings with their own need for therapy. They mention the daughter is \"troubled\" and has been through a lot, so the parent's intention might be to get help for the family. But the daughter's resistance could be due to feeling that her private issues are being shared. The comparison to a surgeon isn't perfect because therapy involves more personal and emotional sharing, which is different from a medical procedure. \n\nThe therapist's endorsement is a point in favor, but the therapist might not fully grasp the daughter's emotional response. Also, the daughter's refusal to have family in therapy suggests she might not be ready for that dynamic. The parent might be overlooking the daughter's emotional needs here. \n\nIn professional ethics, therapists often avoid multiple relationships, but since the therapist consents, it's not a conflict on her end. However, the daughter's well-being is a priority. If the daughter feels her privacy is invaded, that could harm her therapeutic progress. The parent might not realize the depth of the daughter's feelings about privacy. \n\nSo, the parent's intention isn't malicious, but they might be dismissing the daughter's concerns as irrational. The answer hinges on whether respecting the daughter's privacy outweighs the parent's desire for shared therapy. Since the daughter is adamant and the parent is pushing despite her concerns, the parent might be in the wrong here. The answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because the daughter's privacy and feelings are central, and the parent isn't adequately addressing her valid concerns.\n"
