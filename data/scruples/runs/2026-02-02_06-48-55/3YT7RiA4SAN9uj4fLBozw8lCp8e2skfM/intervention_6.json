I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario is that the daughter (Ashley) has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year, and the parent now wants to join her. The therapist agrees, but the daughter is upset about privacy concerns. The parent thinks it's similar to having the same surgeon, and wants to introduce family therapy since Ashley refuses to have sessions with the parent or spouse present. The parent's spouse and daughter think they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical and professional guidelines for therapists. Usually, having multiple clients within the same family can create conflicts. The American Psychological Association has guidelines that mention potential boundary issues. The therapist might have a conflict of interest if they're treating both the parent and child, especially if there's a power dynamic. Even if the therapist says it's okay, there could be a breach of confidentiality between parent and child. \n\nThe daughter's privacy is a big factor. The parent argues they already know most things, but patient confidentiality is a key part of therapy. If the parent is also a client, the therapist has to maintain confidentiality with both, which could be tricky. The parent dismisses the daughter's concerns as \"territorial,\" but the daughter might feel that her private feelings could be shared with the parent, which is a legitimate fear. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's emotional well-being is important. Also, the therapist's agreement doesn't necessarily mean it's the right thing if it harms the daughter's trust or therapy progress.\n\nFamily therapy could be a different approach. The parent mentions Ashley refuses family therapy, so maybe the therapist should facilitate that instead of having both in individual sessions. The parent's analogy to a surgeon is flawed because therapy involves more personal and emotional issues, not just physical procedures. The surgeon analogy doesn't account for the psychological impact of sharing a therapist.\n\nThe parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's boundaries, even if they think they're doing it for the daughter's good. The daughter's \"territorial\" behavior might be a valid reaction to protect her privacy. The parent's insistence could lead to further conflict or make the daughter withhold information in therapy. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent is likely overstepping by not acknowledging the daughter's valid privacy concerns and pushing their own agenda. Even though the therapist is okay with it, the parent's actions could still be inappropriate. So the answer is A.\n"
