I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, but the therapist says it's okay. The parent argues that they want to respect their daughter's feelings but also not give in to what they see as irrational behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The therapist has already agreed that there's no conflict of interest, which is important. Therapists are supposed to maintain boundaries and confidentiality, so if Karla is comfortable with it, that's a positive sign. However, the daughter is clearly uncomfortable. Even if the parent thinks the daughter is being territorial or irrational, the daughter's feelings about privacy are valid. Therapy is a personal process, and sharing the same therapist might make her feel her privacy is invaded, even if the parent isn't getting all the details. \n\nThe parent mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy with them present, so maybe the parent is trying to use this as a way to get family therapy. But if the therapist is okay with it, maybe that's a way to approach it. However, the key issue here is the daughter's consent and comfort. Even if the parent has the therapist's okay, the daughter's right to her own therapy experience is important. The parent might be overlooking the daughter's emotional needs here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the therapist should not be treating two people who have a close relationship unless there's a clear understanding and boundaries. But since the therapist has already agreed, it's within their professional judgment. However, the daughter's objection is about her own privacy and therapy process. The parent is pushing through despite the daughter's objections, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nThe parent says they want to respect her feelings but also not reward irrational behavior. But is the daughter's reaction irrational? It's possible that she's feeling her privacy is being invaded, which is a legitimate concern. The parent should consider that even if they don't see a problem, the daughter does. There's also the aspect of autonomy in therapy; the daughter has the right to her own therapeutic relationship without interference from a parent. \n\nSo, while the parent isn't necessarily doing something illegal or ethically wrong from the therapist's perspective, they might be disregarding their daughter's emotional well-being by not respecting her concerns. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because they are not fully respecting their daughter's perspective, even if the therapist is okay with it.\n"
