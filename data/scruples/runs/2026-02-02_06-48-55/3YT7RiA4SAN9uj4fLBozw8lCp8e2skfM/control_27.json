I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The author, the parent, met Dr. Karla through the on-base hospital and referred Ashley to her. Now that Dr. Karla works independently, the parent wants to see her too. They've discussed it with Dr. Karla, who said it's fine. However, Ashley is upset, thinking it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that since Dr. Karla is experienced and they want family therapy, it's a good step. The wife and daughter think the parent is at fault (AITA), but the parent feels the therapist's approval is valid.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the therapist is okay with seeing both, the daughter is against it, and the parent wants to proceed. The daughter's concern is about privacy, which is a valid ethical consideration. The therapist would need to maintain confidentiality between parent and child, which could be challenging. However, the therapist might have boundaries in place to handle this, like separate sessions or clear rules about information sharing. \n\nBut from a professional ethics standpoint, many therapists avoid treating family members of existing clients to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure impartiality. Even if the therapist is okay, there's a risk of blurred boundaries. The daughter's discomfort is significant; she might feel her privacy is invaded, which could affect her therapy. The parent's intention to use this as a step toward family therapy is good, but if the daughter is resistant, forcing the issue might backfire. \n\nThe parent is trying to address their own mental health and promote family therapy, which is commendable, but they need to respect the daughter's autonomy and privacy. The daughter is \"troubled\" and a teenager, so her emotional needs are crucial here. The therapist's approval is noted, but maybe they didn't consider the daughter's perspective fully. The parent should prioritize the daughter's feelings and perhaps explore other therapists for themselves. Alternatively, involving the therapist in a family session first to address concerns might help, but the daughter's resistance is clear. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are good, they might be overstepping by not fully respecting the daughter's privacy concerns. The therapist's approval doesn't negate the daughter's right to have her privacy respected. So the answer might be A (the parent is in the wrong) because they're ignoring the daughter's valid concerns about privacy, even if the therapist is okay with it.\n"
