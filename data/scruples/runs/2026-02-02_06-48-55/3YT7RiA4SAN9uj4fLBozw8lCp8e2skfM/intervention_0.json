I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, thinking it invades her privacy. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it.\n\nFirst, the parent initiated this by sending their daughter to Karla for therapy a year ago. The daughter liked it and continued. Now the parent wants to see the same therapist. The parent argues that Karla is the only one they trust and that it's no different than a surgeon operating on multiple family members. They also mention wanting to try family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with the parent or spouse present.\n\nThe daughter's main issue is privacy, which is a valid concern. Patient confidentiality is a key part of therapy, but the parent feels they already know a lot and that the daughter's objections are irrational. The parent also mentions challenging the daughter to give a good reason, but the daughter can't come up with one. However, the daughter is described as a troubled teen, which might make her more sensitive about privacy.\n\nThe therapist says it's okay, but the parent is overriding the daughter's feelings. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's comfort is important. Therapy is about trust and a safe space, so if the daughter feels her privacy is violated, that could harm her progress. The parent might not realize how much the daughter values confidentiality, even if the parent knows a lot already.\n\nThe parent is also trying to push family therapy by having the same therapist. The daughter's refusal to have the parent or spouse present might be a red flag that they need to respect her boundaries. The parent might be dismissing the daughter's emotional response as \"territorial\" or irrational, which isn't helpful. The daughter's anger could be a valid expression of her need for autonomy and privacy.\n\nIn professional settings, therapists usually avoid dual relationships to prevent conflicts of interest. While the therapist here says it's okay, the daughter's distress is significant. The parent's insistence could undermine the trust between the daughter and therapist. Even if the parent has good intentions, forcing the issue might cause more harm than good. The daughter might feel her voice isn't heard, leading to resentment or withdrawal from therapy.\n\nSo, considering the daughter's privacy concerns, the potential harm to the therapeutic relationship, and the parent's dismissal of her feelings, it seems the parent is acting in their own interests without fully respecting the daughter's autonomy. Therefore, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
