I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent (the author) wants to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The therapist, Karla, agrees there's no conflict of interest. The daughter is upset about it, citing privacy concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is a teenager, and the parent wants to start seeing the same therapist. The therapist thinks it's okay. The daughter is resistant, maybe due to typical teenage issues or feeling that her privacy is being invaded. The parent argues that it's similar to a surgeon treating both, and they're considering family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with the family present.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, therapists usually have guidelines about seeing multiple family members. If Karla, the therapist, approves, then there's no professional conflict. However, the daughter's feelings about privacy are valid. Teenagers often value their privacy, and seeing the same therapist as a parent could make them feel their confidential issues are being shared. Even if the parent isn't involved in the daughter's sessions, the daughter might still feel uncomfortable knowing their parent is a client of the same therapist.\n\nThe parent's motivation is to seek therapy from someone they trust, but the daughter's discomfort shouldn't be dismissed. The parent mentions challenging the daughter to give reasons against it, but if the daughter is in therapy, her concerns might be rooted in deeper issues, like fear of the parent knowing too much or a power struggle. The parent wants to use this as a step towards family therapy, which the daughter resists. It's possible that even the therapist, Karla, might not realize the full impact on the daughter's trust if the parent is also a client.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting therapy, especially if it's approved by the therapist. But they might be overlooking the daughter's emotional needs. The answer depends on balancing professional approval with the daughter's feelings. Since the therapist is okay with it and the parent is trying to address their own needs, the parent isn't the asshole, but they should handle the situation with sensitivity. The key here is that the therapist is on board, which mitigates professional concerns, so the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
