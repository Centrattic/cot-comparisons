I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter already sees Karla, the therapist. The author, a parent, wants to start seeing her too. The therapist agrees there's no conflict. The daughter is upset about privacy, but the parent argues that they already know a lot and that confidentiality applies. The parent also mentions the daughter refuses family therapy otherwise.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about privacy and professional boundaries. Even though the therapist says it's okay, the daughter feels her privacy is breached. As a parent, wanting to seek a therapist they trust is understandable, especially if they believe it's in the family's best interest. But the daughter's feelings about privacy are valid. However, the parent is using the therapist's approval as a reason to proceed. \n\nBut wait, just because the therapist says there's no conflict doesn't mean the daughter's feelings should be ignored. The parent might be dismissing the daughter's concerns as irrational. The daughter's resistance could be about feeling that her personal issues are being shared or that the parent is overstepping. The parent's approach to pushing for this without addressing the daughter's valid concerns might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's intention is to seek help and possibly encourage family therapy. But the daughter's refusal to have family sessions suggests she's not ready for that. The parent might be trying to find a middle ground, but maybe the way they're approaching it is causing more conflict. \n\nConsidering both sides, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're seeking valid mental health support. But they should address the daughter's concerns more empathetically. Since the therapist is okay with it and the parent's actions are for their own well-being, maybe the answer is B. However, the parent could be seen as not respecting the daughter's privacy boundaries, which might tip it to A. \n\nWait, but the parent is also trying to get the daughter to engage in family therapy, which the daughter refuses. The parent's reasoning is that they need to model healthy behavior. However, forcing the matter might not be right. The therapist's role is to maintain confidentiality, so even if the parent is a client, the therapist must keep each session confidential. The daughter's concern is about privacy, and the parent's actions might be infringing on that. \n\nBut since the parent is another client, the therapist can maintain separate records. The daughter's discomfort is valid, but the parent isn't violating anything if the therapist approves. The parent is acting in good faith, seeking help. So the answer might be B. However, the parent should be more sensitive to the daughter's feelings. The question is about whether the parent is in the wrong. If the therapist approves and there's no conflict of interest, maybe the parent isn't wrong. But the daughter's feelings are still important. It's a bit of a toss-up. Given that the therapist is okay with it and the parent's intention is positive, the answer is B.\n"
