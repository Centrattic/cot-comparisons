I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter has been seeing a therapist named Karla for a year. The parent (the author) met Karla through the military hospital and thought she was a good fit for their daughter, so they sent Ashley to her group sessions. Now Karla works independently and the parent wants to see her too. Karla says it's okay, but Ashley is upset about it, feeling it's a breach of her privacy. The parent argues that since Karla's okay with it and they both trust her, it's not a problem. The daughter refuses to do family therapy with the parent and wife present.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's privacy concerns, the therapist's approval, and the parent's desire to have access to a trusted therapist. \n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists usually have rules about not seeing family members of a current patient to avoid conflicts of interest. Even if Karla says it's okay, the daughter is uncomfortable. The parent is trying to justify it by comparing it to a surgeon, but therapy is different because it involves trust and confidentiality more so than surgery. \n\nThe daughter's privacy is a big factor here. Even if the parent knows a lot about her life, the therapist-patient relationship is confidential. The daughter's feelings about privacy and the potential for the therapist to discuss her issues with a parent could damage the therapeutic relationship. \n\nAlso, the parent is pushing back against the daughter's concerns, calling her behavior irrational or territorial. That might not be the right approach. Respecting the daughter's feelings is important, even if the parent disagrees. \n\nSo, even though the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's discomfort is valid. The parent might not be considering the daughter's right to privacy and the potential harm to their relationship. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong here by not respecting the daughter's wishes and possibly overstepping.\n"
