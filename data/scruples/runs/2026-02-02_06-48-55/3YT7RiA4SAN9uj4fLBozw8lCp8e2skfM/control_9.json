I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong here. The situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist as their daughter, who is a teenager. The daughter is upset about it, and the parent got the therapist's approval. The daughter feels it's a breach of privacy, but the parent argues that the therapist is okay with it and that they might benefit from family therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they often value their independence and privacy more. The parent might not realize how much the daughter's privacy is important. Even though the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's feelings are still valid. The parent is pushing back, saying that the therapist approves and that it's like having a surgeon operate on both. But that analogy isn't quite the same because therapists deal with sensitive personal issues, not just medical procedures.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of patient confidentiality. The therapist would have to maintain confidentiality for both the parent and the daughter if they're both clients. But in family therapy, the approach is different. The parent wants to use this as an opportunity for family sessions, but the daughter is against it. The daughter is \"troubled,\" so this could add stress if she's forced into family therapy.\n\nI should also think about the daughter's perspective. Even if the parent thinks they know a lot already, the daughter might feel vulnerable sharing personal issues in front of the parent. The parent's insistence could make the daughter feel that her privacy isn't respected, which might hinder her progress in therapy. The parent is challenging the daughter to give a reason why it's a problem, but maybe the daughter just feels uncomfortable without a clear explanation, which is common in teens.\n\nThe parent is trying to balance respecting the daughter's feelings while not giving in to what they see as irrational behavior. However, the daughter's resistance might be a way of asserting her autonomy. The parent's decision to proceed without the daughter's consent could be seen as dismissive of her feelings, even if the therapist is okay with it.\n\nIn terms of ethics, therapists usually avoid dual relationships to prevent conflicts of interest. If the therapist is treating both parent and child, it could complicate the therapeutic relationship. The therapist might have to manage boundaries carefully. While the therapist here says it's fine, it's important to consider if that's the case in practice. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the parent's actions might not be inherently wrong, but they're not considering the daughter's feelings adequately. The daughter's right to privacy and comfort in therapy is significant. The parent's approach could be seen as overstepping, especially if the daughter's therapy is meant to be a safe space. Even if the therapist approves, the daughter's objection is valid and should be respected. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong here.\n"
