I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent (the author) met Karla through work, sent Ashley to her, and now Karla is independent. The parent wants to see her too, and Karla agreed there's no conflict. But Ashley is upset about it, feeling it's a privacy breach. The parent argues that they already know a lot and that it's like a surgeon seeing both family members. The wife and daughter think the parent is wrong (TA), but the parent thinks Karla's approval matters.\n\nI need to consider boundaries and privacy. Therapists usually maintain confidentiality, so even if the parent knows some things, seeing the same therapist could make Ashley feel her private matters are being shared. The parent's main point is that Karla said it's okay, but the dynamic might still affect Ashley's comfort. Family therapy could be a better approach if they want to discuss things together. The parent wants to avoid rewarding Ashley's anger but needs to balance respecting her feelings. The key here is that the daughter is a teenager, which can make them more sensitive about privacy. Even if the therapist approves, the parent should consider the daughter's emotional needs. The answer might hinge on whether respecting the daughter's privacy is more important than the parent's desire to have the same therapist. The parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, but needs to be cautious. However, the daughter's feelings are valid, so maybe the parent is overstepping. Hmm, but the therapist said it's okay. Still, the daughter's consent isn't considered here. The parent is pushing despite her objections. So, maybe the answer is A, the parent is in the wrong because they're disregarding the daughter's privacy concerns even without a valid reason beyond their own convenience.\n"
