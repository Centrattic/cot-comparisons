I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (a parent) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is against it, citing privacy concerns, while the therapist approves. The parent feels they have a valid reason and the therapist's okay.\n\nFirst, consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager who already goes to therapy, and sharing the same therapist might make her uncomfortable. Privacy is a big deal in therapy, and she might fear that her personal issues become known to her parent. The parent acknowledges patient confidentiality but the daughter still feels it's a breach. That's subjective, but the daughter's feelings are valid.\n\nThen there's the therapist's role. Karla has agreed, but she might not have considered the daughter's emotional response just yet. Therapists should be cautious about dual relationships. If the parent and daughter both see the same therapist, it could complicate sessions. The parent might inadvertently share information, even unintentionally, which could affect the daughter's trust. Plus, the therapist's ability to remain neutral could be compromised if there's a family dynamic involved.\n\nThe parent's intention is to get help and possibly start family therapy, which the daughter currently refuses. The parent is trying to model behavior by seeking therapy themselves. However, pushing through despite the daughter's objections might undermine her autonomy. The daughter's resistance could be a sign of needing her own space, which is important for her development.\n\nThe parent mentions the daughter is \"troubled,\" so maybe there's more going on. But even so, respecting boundaries is crucial. The parent might be overestimating the therapist's ability to handle both relationships without issues. The therapist might not have considered all potential conflicts, like if the parent and daughter have different therapeutic needs or if the daughter feels pressured to open up in front of her parent.\n\nAlso, the parent is comparing it to a surgeon operating on both, but that's different. Surgeons work on the body, and the relationship is more transactional. Therapy involves deep personal issues, so the dynamics are different. The daughter might feel her inner thoughts are being exposed to her parent, which is a privacy concern not present in a surgical setting.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are good, the daughter's feelings about privacy and autonomy should be respected. The therapist's approval doesn't override the daughter's emotional needs. The parent might not be wrong in seeking therapy, but choosing the same provider as the daughter could be problematic. So the answer is A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
