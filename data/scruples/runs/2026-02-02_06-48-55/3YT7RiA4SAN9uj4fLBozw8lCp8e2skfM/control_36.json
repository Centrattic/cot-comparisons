I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario involves Ashley, the daughter, who has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent, the author of the question, met Karla through their military base's hospital and recommended her to Ashley. Now that Karla works independently, the parent wants to see her too, but Ashley is against it, citing privacy concerns. The parent thinks Karla is trustworthy and that it's no different than a surgeon treating multiple family members. The therapist says it's fine, but the daughter is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical boundaries here. Therapists are supposed to maintain boundaries to protect patient confidentiality and avoid conflicts of interest. If Karla is seeing both parent and child, there's a potential for crossed boundaries. Even if the therapist thinks it's okay, the daughter feels her privacy is breached. \n\nThe daughter is a teenager, which is a time when privacy and autonomy are important. Even if the parent knows a lot about her life, the perception of privacy violation is significant. The parent might be trying to facilitate family therapy, but the daughter refuses. The therapist's role in this situation should be to maintain confidentiality for both parties. \n\nHowever, the parent's intention is to seek help and possibly start family therapy. But the daughter's refusal needs to be respected. The parent might not be in the wrong if they're seeking therapy independently, but the way they're approaching it could be problematic. The key issue is whether the therapist is overstepping by taking on both family members, which can lead to complex dynamics. \n\nThe parent might not realize that even if the therapist approves, the daughter's feelings of privacy being violated are valid. The parent's analogy to a surgeon is flawed because therapists deal with sensitive, personal issues that surgeons don't. The parent's persistence in challenging the daughter to give reasons for her objection could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intent isn't malicious, the action of seeing the same therapist as their daughter, despite the daughter's objections, could be considered in the wrong because it disregards her right to privacy and the therapist's potential conflict of interest. So the answer would be A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
