I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author of this story is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, but the therapist is okay with it. The parent wants to get help from the same therapist, maybe leading to family therapy since the daughter refuses to have sessions with them present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, which can be a time of heightened sensitivity around privacy. The parent mentions that the daughter thinks it's a breach of privacy. Even if the parent knows a lot already, the daughter might feel that her private issues are being shared, even if they aren't. The parent acknowledges patient confidentiality, but the daughter might still feel uncomfortable. Teenagers can be very territorial about their personal space and relationships, especially if they're already troubled, as mentioned here.\n\nThen there's the therapist's role. The therapist has agreed it's okay, but the parent is the one initiating the request. Therapists have ethical guidelines about boundaries. If the therapist is okay with seeing both, that's part of the professional judgment. But there could be issues if the daughter feels her privacy is invaded. The parent might not realize the emotional impact on the daughter. Also, the parent is pushing to move towards family therapy, but the daughter resists that. If the daughter isn't ready, forcing the issue could create more tension.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that the therapist is trusted and the same skilled surgeon analogy. But a therapist isn't a surgeon, and the nature of therapy involves more personal and confidential information. The parent might be underestimating the daughter's need for autonomy and privacy. Even if the parent has a valid reason to seek therapy, the daughter's feelings should be taken seriously. The parent is challenging the daughter to give reasons against it, but maybe the daughter isn't articulate enough to explain her feelings beyond privacy. The parent might be dismissing her valid concerns as irrational or territorial behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent has their own needs for therapy and the therapist is willing to accommodate. The therapist's professional opinion is that it's okay, so maybe there's no conflict of interest. However, the daughter's comfort is important for effective therapy. If the daughter feels her privacy is compromised, she might not open up as much, which could affect her treatment. The parent's insistence could also create a power dynamic where the daughter feels her feelings aren't respected, leading to more resistance.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the therapist should ensure that both clients feel comfortable. If the daughter is uncomfortable, the therapist might need to handle the situation carefully, maybe by setting clear boundaries or not continuing with both. However, the parent is the one seeking the arrangement, not the therapist. The parent's actions might not be unethical, but they could be inconsiderate of the daughter's feelings. The parent's motivation is to seek help, which is understandable, but the method could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the parent might not be in the wrong in terms of their intention, but they might be inconsiderate of the daughter's emotional needs. However, since the daughter is an adult (if they're using \"she\" and the parent refers to her as a \"troubled\" teen, maybe she's a minor), the parent's ability to choose their own therapist might be more limited if the daughter is a minor. Wait, but the parent is an adult seeking therapy, so the daughter's age could be a factor. If the daughter is a minor, the parent might have more authority, but the daughter's feelings are still important. If the daughter is an adult, then the parent's choice is their own, but the daughter's comfort is still a consideration.\n\nThe parent might be in the wrong if they're disregarding the daughter's valid concerns. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's consent and comfort are crucial. The parent is challenging the daughter to provide a reason, but the daughter's feelings are valid even if she can't articulate them well. The parent might be prioritizing their own need for therapy without fully considering the daughter's perspective, which could damage their relationship and the daughter's willingness to engage in therapy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the parent might be in the wrong (A) because they are not respecting the daughter's feelings about privacy and autonomy, even if the therapist approves. The parent's approach could harm the daughter's therapy and their relationship.\n"
