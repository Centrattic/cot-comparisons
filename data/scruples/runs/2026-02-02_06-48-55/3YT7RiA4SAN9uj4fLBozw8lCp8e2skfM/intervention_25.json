I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves the author's daughter, Ashley, who's been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author now wants to see Karla too, but Ashley is upset about it. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter feels it's a privacy breach. The author argues that since Karla is trusted and the therapy is separate, it's not an issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when privacy and independence are important. Even if the author is right that the therapist approves and there's no conflict, the daughter's feelings matter. The author mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy but wants this setup, maybe seeing the therapist as a private space. By sharing the therapist, the daughter might feel that space is invaded. \n\nThe author is trying to be inclusive and possibly push for family therapy, but using the same therapist might not be the best approach. The daughter might feel that her private sessions are now part of her family's domain, which could lead to more resistance. Also, the therapist's role in maintaining boundaries is crucial. Even if Karla says it's okay, the daughter's consent isn't considered here. The daughter's privacy concerns are valid, especially given patient confidentiality. The author might not realize that sharing a therapist could make the daughter reluctant to open up, fearing that information might be shared with parents, even if confidentiality isn't breached. \n\nThe author's comparison to a surgeon is flawed. Surgeons operate on a physical body, but therapy deals with personal, emotional issues where privacy is paramount. The daughter's reaction is a sign that she needs her own safe space. The author might be dismissing her feelings as irrational, but that could be a sign of not respecting her autonomy. The wife's opinion isn't specified, but both wife and daughter think the author is wrong. The author's desire to have family therapy is understandable, but the approach here might be counterproductive. Instead of using the same therapist, maybe finding a different family therapist would be better. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not considering the daughter's emotional needs and privacy, which is crucial in a therapeutic relationship. Even though the therapist approves, the daughter's consent and comfort are essential. The author's actions might undermine the daughter's trust in therapy. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
