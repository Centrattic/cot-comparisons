I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a daughter named Ashley who's been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. The father wants to start seeing Karla too, but Ashley is upset about it. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter feels it's a breach of privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father has a history of referring his daughter to Karla, and now he wants to be a patient himself. The daughter is resistant, possibly feeling that her privacy is compromised. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it. The father thinks it's similar to having the same surgeon, but that's not exactly the same scenario. Therapists deal with emotional and personal issues, which are more sensitive when family is involved.\n\nBoundaries in therapy are crucial. Even if the therapist agrees, having a parent and child see the same therapist could lead to complications. The daughter might feel uncomfortable if her father knows more about her therapy or if the therapist has to navigate both roles. It might blur professional boundaries and affect the therapeutic relationship for both the daughter and the father.\n\nThe daughter's resistance is about privacy. Even though the father argues that he already knows a lot, patient confidentiality is a key aspect. The therapist might not share all details, but having the parent involved could make the daughter hold back in sessions, thinking the parent might find out. That could hinder her progress.\n\nAlso, the father wants to use this as an introduction to family therapy, but the daughter refuses. Maybe there's an underlying issue here that needs addressing through different means. The father might be trying to force a solution that's not working, risking further conflict with his daughter.\n\nThe therapist's role is to maintain confidentiality and provide effective treatment. If the therapist is okay with both, maybe they have strategies in place. But typically, it's not standard practice to have parent and child see the same therapist unless it's part of structured family therapy, which isn't the case here. The father's approach could be seen as overstepping, not respecting his daughter's autonomy and privacy.\n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. If both parents and the daughter are against it, the father might be acting unilaterally, which could strain family dynamics. The daughter's behavior is described as \"troubled,\" so her resistance might be more than just being a teenager; it could be a valid concern about her mental space.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the therapist agrees, the father's decision to seek the same therapist as his daughter without her consent and despite her objections might not be respectful of her privacy and autonomy. The potential for conflict and the impact on therapy effectiveness are significant. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
