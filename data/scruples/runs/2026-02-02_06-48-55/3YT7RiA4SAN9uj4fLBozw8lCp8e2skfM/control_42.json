I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the parent, let's call him John for clarity, has a daughter named Ashley who's been seeing a therapist, Karla, for a year. He initially recommended her to Ashley because he thought she was good. Now Karla works independently, and John wants to see her too. He checked with Karla, who said it's okay. But Ashley is upset, feeling it's an invasion of her privacy.\n\nThe parent argues that Karla's okay with it and that he wants to involve the therapist in family therapy since Ashley refuses sessions with him or his wife present. The parent also mentions that Ashley is a troubled teen and that he's been through a lot with his military tours. He feels it's similar to a surgeon operating on both parent and child, implying it's about shared trust in a professional.\n\nThe daughter's main issue is privacy. Even though the parent acknowledges confidentiality, she's still uncomfortable. The parent is trying to balance respecting her feelings without giving in to what he sees as her anger or territorial behavior.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, therapists usually avoid dual relationships (like treating both family members) because it can create conflicts of interest and privacy issues. But Karla is okay with it. However, the daughter's consent is another factor. Even if the therapist approves, the client's comfort is important. The daughter might feel her privacy is compromised, even if she knows confidentiality exists. \n\nThe parent is pushing for family therapy, which could be beneficial, but the fact that Ashley refuses sessions with family present might mean she's not ready. The parent's intention is good, but the daughter's feelings need to be considered. Forcing this might undermine her trust in therapy or the parent.\n\nSo, while the parent has a valid reason and the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's feelings about privacy and her resistance to family involvement might mean the parent isn't considering her perspective enough. The parent should prioritize Ashley's comfort and maybe find another therapist for himself, rather than persisting in a way that might damage their relationship or her therapy.\n"
