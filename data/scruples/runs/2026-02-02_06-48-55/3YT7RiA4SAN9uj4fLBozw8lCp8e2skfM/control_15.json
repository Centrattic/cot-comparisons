I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter is uncomfortable with this arrangement, but the therapist, Karla, says it's okay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical guidelines for therapists. Therapists are supposed to maintain boundaries and confidentiality. If the therapist is seeing both the parent and the child, there could be potential conflicts. The daughter feels her privacy is being invaded, and the parent is pushing back, saying that they already know a lot and that confidentiality applies. But the daughter is a teenager, which is a time when privacy is especially important.\n\nThe therapist's involvement is crucial here. If Karla, the therapist, has assessed the situation and deemed it appropriate, that might help, but therapists are trained to recognize boundaries. However, even if the therapist thinks it's okay, there's a risk of dual relationships, which can impair the therapist's objectivity. Ethically, a therapist should avoid situations where they have multiple roles with a family, unless they're prepared to manage all the potential issues.\n\nThe daughter's resistance is significant. She's not just being a typical teenager; she's described as troubled. Her feelings of privacy being breached could exacerbate her issues. The parent wants to use this as a way into family therapy, but the daughter refuses family sessions already. Pushing this might backfire, making her more resistant to future therapy.\n\nThe parent's argument about a surgeon is a bit weak because medical professionals handle confidentiality differently. The analogy doesn't hold up when considering the nature of therapy and trust. Also, the parent's wife is on the side of the daughter, suggesting the parent is overstepping.\n\nSo, while the therapist says it's okay, the ethical considerations in therapy usually prioritize the client's comfort and confidentiality. The daughter's discomfort is valid, and even if the therapist is okay, proceeding without addressing the daughter's concerns might harm the therapeutic relationship. The parent might be disregarding the daughter's autonomy here, which is a key part of therapy ethics. Therefore, the answer would be AITA for the parent.\n"
