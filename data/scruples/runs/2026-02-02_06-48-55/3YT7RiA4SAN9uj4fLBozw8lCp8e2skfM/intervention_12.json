I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter, Ashley. The situation involves family dynamics, privacy concerns, and professional boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author sent their daughter to the therapist, Karla, a year ago, and now they want to see her too. The therapist says it's fine, but the daughter is upset about privacy. The author feels like it's similar to a surgeon treating multiple family members and doesn't see a problem, but the daughter is upset. The author wants to do family therapy but the daughter refuses.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's privacy, the therapist's approval, the family's dynamics, and whether the author is overstepping. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when privacy and independence are important. Even though the author knows a lot about her life, the daughter might feel that sharing her personal issues with the therapist is sacred, and having her parent involved could violate that trust. The therapist's opinion is that it's okay, but the daughter is clearly upset. \n\nThe author is trying to balance respecting their daughter's feelings while not giving in to what they see as irrational behavior. They also mention wanting to introduce family therapy, which the daughter refuses. But family therapy usually requires mutual consent. If the daughter doesn't agree, forcing it might not be effective. \n\nThe author's argument is that they trust Karla and think it's a good idea, but the daughter's privacy is a significant concern. The therapist's role is to maintain confidentiality between the patient and the therapist. If the author starts seeing the same therapist, there might be situations where information could get shared or where the daughter feels her privacy is invaded. Even if the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's feelings are valid. The author might be underestimating how important the daughter's privacy is in this context. \n\nAlso, the author's comparison to a surgeon treating both family members isn't quite the same. Surgeons have a different kind of relationship with their patients, and the nature of therapy is more about personal, confidential issues. The daughter's anger might be about feeling that her private thoughts are being shared or that her autonomy is being disregarded. \n\nIn family therapy, the consent of all parties involved is crucial. Since the daughter is resistant, the author pushing forward might be disregarding her autonomy. The author might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the daughter's boundaries, even if they believe they're doing it for the right reasons. The therapist's approval doesn't override the daughter's right to privacy and her own decision-making about her therapy.\n"
