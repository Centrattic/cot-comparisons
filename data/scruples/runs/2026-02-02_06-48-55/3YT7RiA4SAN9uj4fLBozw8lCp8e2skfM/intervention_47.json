I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, thinking it's a privacy breach. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The author feels the daughter is being irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. Teens often value their privacy, especially in therapy. The daughter might feel that sharing a therapist with her parent could make her uncomfortable, or that the parent is overstepping. Even if the parent knows a lot already, therapy is a safe space where a teen can discuss things they wouldn't want their parents to know. The parent's desire to see the same therapist might undermine that trust.\n\nThen there's the therapist's perspective. While Karla says it's fine, I wonder if that's in her best interest. Therapists are supposed to maintain boundaries to avoid conflicts of interest. If the same therapist is treating multiple family members, there could be issues with confidentiality, dual relationships, or potential bias. Even if Karla is okay with it, maybe professional ethics guidelines advise against it. The parent might not be considering the therapeutic relationship from the daughter's point of view.\n\nThe parent is comparing it to a surgeon treating both, but that's different. A surgeon's job isn't about personal confidences and emotional issues the same way therapy is. The daughter's resistance isn't just about privacy; it could stem from needing her own separate space for healing. The parent wants family therapy, but the daughter refuses, so maybe this is a way to push boundaries.\n\nThe wife and daughter think the author is \"taking the AITA\" (Assume the Author Is the Target), but the author doesn't see it that way. However, respecting the daughter's feelings is important. Even if the therapist says it's okay, the parent should weigh the daughter's comfort. Forcing the same therapist might harm the daughter's willingness to continue therapy.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong by not fully respecting the daughter's privacy concerns and her need for a separate therapeutic relationship. Even if the therapist is fine, the daughter's comfort and trust are crucial. The parent should consider alternative ways to address their own mental health without infringing on the daughter's space.\n"
