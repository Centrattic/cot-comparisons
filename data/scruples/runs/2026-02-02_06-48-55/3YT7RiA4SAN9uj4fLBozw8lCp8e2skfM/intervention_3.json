I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter (Ashley) is already seeing therapist Karla, who the parent introduced her to. Now the parent wants to see Karla too, but the daughter is upset about it, claiming it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that Karla said it's fine and that the daughter's concerns are irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in therapy. It's important to respect patient confidentiality. Even though the parent might know a lot about their daughter's issues, the therapist-patient relationship is confidential. If the daughter feels her privacy is being invaded, that's a valid concern. The parent might not realize how intrusive this can feel, even if the therapist approves. Therapy is a safe space, and having a family member involved could make the daughter uncomfortable sharing openly.\n\nThen there's the professional opinion. The therapist said it's fine, but the daughter is upset. The parent is dismissing the daughter's feelings as irrational or territorial. That's a red flag. The daughter has been through a lot, so her emotional response should be taken seriously. The parent is trying to equate it to a surgeon, but that's not the same as therapy where trust and confidentiality are crucial.\n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy, so they think this is a way to get around that. But approaching it without the daughter's consent might not be the best approach. Instead of forcing the issue, maybe the parent should talk to Karla about how to address the daughter's concerns or suggest a different therapist for themselves to avoid conflict.\n\nThe parent's main justification is that Karla approved it. However, the therapist's approval doesn't negate the daughter's feelings. The parent should prioritize the daughter's comfort and trust in her therapy. If the daughter is resistant, pushing ahead could harm the therapeutic relationship and the parent-child relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intention might be to seek help and be close as a family, respecting the daughter's boundaries is more important. The parent is dismissing her valid concerns, which could lead to further issues. So, the answer is A, the parent is in the wrong.\n"
