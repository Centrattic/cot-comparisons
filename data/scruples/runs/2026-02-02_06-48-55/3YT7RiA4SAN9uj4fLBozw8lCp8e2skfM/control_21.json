I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a parent whose daughter is seeing a therapist named Karla. The author wants to start seeing the same therapist. The daughter is against it, citing privacy concerns. The therapist says it's okay. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong\" (AITA) for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the daughter's perspective is important here. Teenagers often value their privacy, especially when it comes to therapy. Therapy is a confidential space, and if the daughter feels that the parent seeing the same therapist might interfere with that, it's a valid concern. The parent argues that since the therapist has consented and there's no conflict of interest, it's acceptable. However, the therapist's role is to maintain boundaries between family members to protect each individual's confidentiality and therapeutic relationship.\n\nI should consider professional ethics here. Therapists typically avoid treating both a patient and their family members to prevent potential conflicts of interest, breaches of confidentiality, and complications in the therapeutic relationship. Even if the therapist in this case says it's okay, there might be underlying issues. For example, the daughter might feel pressured or that her privacy is being invaded. The parent might also face challenges in maintaining an objective therapeutic relationship if both are part of the same family dynamics.\n\nThe daughter's resistance could be due to feeling territorial or not wanting to share her private thoughts with someone else (the parent) who is now part of the therapist's circle. Even if the parent knows a lot already, the therapeutic setting is different. The daughter might fear that the therapist could inadvertently share information or that the parent might influence the therapy sessions.\n\nThe parent's reasoning about family therapy is a good point, but the daughter is refusing sessions with family present. The parent wants to use this as an introduction to family therapy, but the daughter's refusal might indicate she's not ready for that. Forcing the issue could damage the daughter's trust in both the therapist and the parent.\n\nThe parent's military background and the daughter's troubled history might add complexity. The parent might feel they need someone they trust to handle their issues, but the daughter's needs and boundaries should also be respected. The therapist's approval is part of the equation, but professional guidelines might advise against it. Even if the therapist is okay, it's possible they might not have considered all the long-term implications.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are understandable, the daughter's privacy and boundaries are significant factors. The parent might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist, but they might be overlooking the daughter's valid concerns about privacy and the potential complications in the therapeutic relationships. The answer hinges on balancing the parent's needs with the daughter's right to confidentiality and comfort in therapy.\n"
