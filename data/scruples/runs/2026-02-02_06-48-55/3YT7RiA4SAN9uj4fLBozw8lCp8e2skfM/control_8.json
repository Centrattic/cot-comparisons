I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the parent is at fault (AITA) for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is uncomfortable with this, citing privacy concerns. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay and there's no conflict. The parent argues that it's similar to a surgeon treating multiple family members and that the daughter's resistance is just anger or territorial behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and professional boundaries here. Therapists usually have to avoid conflicts of interest. Even if the parent and daughter both see the same therapist, there could be issues with confidentiality, dual relationships, and potential biases. For example, if the parent and daughter are both clients, the therapist might struggle to maintain objectivity in either session. They might also be influenced by what the parent shares about the daughter, which could affect how they approach the daughter's treatment.\n\nThe daughter's privacy is a key concern. Even though the parent claims they know a lot already, the therapist is supposed to keep patient information confidential. If the therapist were to see both, there might be a breach of that confidentiality, either intentionally or unintentionally. The daughter's discomfort is valid here because sharing personal issues with a therapist who also treats a close family member can feel violating.\n\nHowever, the therapist in this case says it's okay. But therapists are trained to recognize potential conflicts, so if Karla is okay with it, maybe she's considered it and found no issues. But maybe the parent isn't aware of all the implications. The parent might be overlooking the daughter's valid feelings of needing her own private space, even if the therapist is okay with it.\n\nThe parent's reasoning that it's like a surgeon treating both is a bit of a stretch. Surgeons can handle multiple family members because the relationship is more clinical and doesn't involve the same level of personal, emotional disclosure as therapy. Therapy requires a deeper trust and confidentiality, so the comparison might not hold.\n\nThe daughter's resistance isn't just anger; it could be a legitimate desire for autonomy and privacy. Rewarding or punishing the daughter for this might not be the right approach. The parent might be dismissing her valid concerns by labeling them as \"irrational\" or \"territorial.\" The parent's intention for family therapy is good, but the approach of using the same therapist might complicate things instead of helping.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions are to seek trusted help and possibly encourage family therapy, the situation raises ethical issues about confidentiality and the daughter's right to privacy. The therapist's approval might not account for all the dynamics, especially the daughter's perspective. So, the parent might be in the wrong for not fully considering the daughter's valid concerns and the potential professional pitfalls, even if the therapist is okay with it.\n"
