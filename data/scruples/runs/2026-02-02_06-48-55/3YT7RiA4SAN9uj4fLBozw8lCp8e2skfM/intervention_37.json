I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation involves a military family where the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The parent (the author) approached Karla about also being her therapist, and Karla agreed. However, Ashley is upset about it, citing privacy concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical guidelines for therapists. The American Psychological Association (APA) has ethical standards regarding dual relationships. Dual relationships occur when a therapist is involved with a patient in two different capacities, like also being their parent. This can create conflicts of interest and potential boundary issues. The APA generally advises against dual relationships because they can compromise the therapist's objectivity and the patient's trust.\n\nIn this case, the therapist is treating both the parent and the daughter. Even if Karla is open to it, the daughter feels her privacy is breached. The parent argues that they already know a lot and that patient confidentiality applies. However, the daughter's resistance might be valid if she perceives a loss of confidentiality or feels uncomfortable. The therapist's approval doesn't negate the potential ethical issues here. Karla might have a conflict of interest by treating family members, as it could affect her ability to remain neutral in sessions with each individual.\n\nThe parent's reasoning about family therapy is a valid point, but the daughter refuses family therapy, so using the same therapist might not be the solution. The parent might be dismissing the daughter's feelings as unreasonable, which could undermine the daughter's trust in therapy. The parent's comparison to a surgeon is flawed because therapists deal with confidentiality and emotional dynamics differently.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns and possibly violating ethical boundaries. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to confirm if dual relationships between therapist and family members are ethically prohibited.\n"
