I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the author introduced their daughter to the therapist, who is now independent. The therapist is okay with seeing the author too, but the daughter is upset about it, citing privacy issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Therapists typically have boundaries about treating family members of their existing patients. Even if the therapist says it's okay, there might be some conflicts. For example, if the therapist discusses the daughter with the parent, that could breach confidentiality. The daughter might feel her privacy is violated, which is a valid concern for a teenager. The parent might not realize the sensitivity around sharing personal therapy details, even if it's about their own child.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that they trust the therapist and want to start family therapy since the daughter refuses sessions with the parents. But the daughter is already \"troubled,\" so adding tension over shared therapy could worsen the situation. The parent is dismissing the daughter's concerns as irrational or territorial, which might not be fair. The daughter's privacy is important, and the parent pushing despite her objections could be seen as not respecting her autonomy.\n\nThe therapist's approval is mentioned, but maybe the therapist didn't consider all potential conflicts. Therapists should avoid dual relationships that could impair their objectivity or the client's well-being. Even if the therapist thinks it's okay, there might be underlying issues they haven't addressed. The parent's argument about a surgeon is a bit weak because surgery doesn't involve the same level of personal, emotional disclosure as therapy.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? They might be overstepping by not adequately respecting their daughter's privacy concerns. The daughter's feelings are valid, and the parent's insistence could harm the therapeutic relationship or the daughter's trust. Even if the therapist agrees, the parent's approach might not be considerate of the daughter's emotional needs. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
