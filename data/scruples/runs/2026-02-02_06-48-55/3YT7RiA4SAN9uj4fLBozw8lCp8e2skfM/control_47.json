I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist their daughter is seeing. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but the daughter is not, citing privacy concerns. The parent argues that the therapist said it's fine and that it's like having the same surgeon, so they're not in the wrong. The wife and daughter think the parent is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The parent's reasoning is that the therapist is professional, has approved it, and that the parent wants to be involved in their daughter's mental health, maybe even start family therapy. The daughter is a teenager who might be sensitive about privacy. The key points here are privacy, professional boundaries, and the daughter's comfort.\n\nThe daughter is 18 or older? The story doesn't specify, but since she's in therapy and a typical teenager, maybe in high school. If she's a minor, the parent might have more authority, but the daughter's feelings are still important. However, if she's an adult, the parent can't just decide for her. But the story doesn't clarify that. \n\nThe therapist is okay with it, which is a plus. Therapists are trained to handle such situations and would consider potential conflicts. But even if the therapist is okay, the daughter's discomfort is a valid concern. Privacy in therapy is crucial for building trust. If the daughter feels her privacy is compromised, she might be less open with the therapist, which could hinder her progress. \n\nThe parent is pushing despite the daughter's objections. They mention challenging her to give a reason and not backing down, which could be seen as dismissing her feelings. The parent wants to enforce family therapy, but the daughter already refuses sessions with family present. This could be a power struggle where the parent is prioritizing their own needs or the therapist's approval over the daughter's comfort.\n\nThe parent's analogy of a surgeon is a bit forced. It's not the same because a surgeon's work is more about physical health and doesn't involve the same level of personal disclosure and confidentiality. Therapy is more about personal issues, so the overlap could be problematic.\n\nThe wife and daughter's perspective is that the parent is overstepping. Even if the therapist is okay, the daughter's emotional well-being is important. The parent might be ignoring the daughter's autonomy and the potential negative impact on the therapeutic relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong, given the therapist's approval, but they are possibly overstepping by not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns and emotional needs. The daughter's feelings are valid, and the parent's insistence could harm the daughter's therapy. So the parent might be in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's autonomy and privacy, even if the therapist is okay with it."
