I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the context: The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The author, the parent, met Karla through the military hospital and recommended her to Ashley. Now Karla works independently and the author wants to see her too. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset about privacy. The parent thinks the daughter's concerns are irrational and wants to do family therapy since Ashley refuses sessions with family present. The wife and daughter think the parent is in the wrong, but the therapist is okay with it.\n\nI need to determine if the parent is wrong here. From a professional standpoint, therapists often have boundaries about treating multiple family members to maintain objectivity and protect confidentiality. But in this case, the therapist Karla said it's fine. However, the daughter is uncomfortable, which is a red flag. Even if the therapist approves, the daughter's feelings about privacy are valid. Sharing a therapist can create conflicts, especially if the daughter feels her privacy is invaded. The parent's insistence might undermine the daughter's trust in therapy, which is crucial. Also, using the analogy of a surgeon treating multiple family members isn't quite the same because therapy involves more personal and sensitive information. The parent's desire for family therapy is understandable, but the daughter's refusal to have family present needs respect. Pushing against her resistance could be seen as dismissive of her needs. So, while the therapist's approval is a point in the parent's favor, the daughter's privacy concerns and the potential for conflict suggest the parent might be overstepping. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
