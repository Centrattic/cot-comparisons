I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter.\n\nFirst, the daughter (Ashley) has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The author introduced her to the therapist, and now they both want to see her. The therapist agrees, but the daughter is upset about privacy. The author argues that since they already know a lot about each other's issues, there's no harm, but the daughter feels it's a privacy breach. The wife also thinks the author is wrong, but the therapist is okay with it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter's privacy concerns, the therapist's professional opinion, and the author's reasoning. The author mentions that the therapist said it's fine, but the daughter is a teen dealing with a lot, and the parent wants to use this as a step toward family therapy. However, the daughter is resistant to family sessions. The author is pushing back against the daughter's anger, calling it irrational or territorial.\n\nNow, considering ethical boundaries in therapy, sharing a therapist between parent and child can be problematic. Even if the therapist agrees, the daughter might feel her privacy is invaded. Therapists usually maintain confidentiality, but the parent knows more from shared information. The daughter's resistance is valid because she might not want her personal issues discussed with her parent. The parent might not realize the emotional impact on the daughter. Also, even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's well-being is important. The parent's approach could be seen as disregarding the daughter's feelings, especially since the daughter is in a vulnerable state. The parent's analogy to a surgeon is flawed because therapy involves more personal and emotional content. The answer hinges on respecting the daughter's autonomy and privacy. So, the author might be in the wrong for not fully respecting the daughter's concerns.\n"
