I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist as their daughter. The therapist, Karla, is okay with it, but the daughter is upset about it. The parent thinks it's similar to having the same surgeon, just a professional. The daughter's argument is about privacy, but the parent argues that there's not much they don't already know, except for confidential stuff. The parent also wants to introduce family therapy since the daughter refuses to have sessions with parents present.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The therapist was initially recommended by the parent and the daughter started seeing her. Now the parent wants to join. The therapist said it's okay, but the daughter is against it. So, even though the therapist is okay, the daughter's feelings are important. The parent is trying to balance their own needs and their daughter's privacy.\n\nThe daughter is a teenager, which can be a time of wanting independence and privacy. Even if the parent is trying to be respectful, the daughter's discomfort could be valid. The parent mentions that the daughter is \"troubled,\" so maybe there are deeper issues here. The parent might not be considering the emotional impact on the daughter. \n\nThe parent is using an analogy to a surgeon, but therapists handle sensitive personal information, and the dynamic is different. The daughter might feel that her private struggles are being shared or that the parent is overstepping. The parent also mentions that they want to do family therapy, which the daughter refuses. Maybe the daughter feels that the parent is forcing their hand, leading to resistance.\n\nThe therapist's role here is important. If the therapist is okay with both clients, maybe there's a conflict of interest even if the therapist isn't aware. For example, the therapist might have to navigate boundaries between two family members in the same practice. There's also the risk of the daughter feeling that her confidentiality is compromised, even if the therapist isn't sharing information. The parent's insistence might be seen as dismissive of the daughter's feelings, which could harm their relationship.\n\nThe parent is trying to respect the daughter's feelings but also not wanting to give in to anger or territorial behavior. However, the daughter's resistance might be a valid expression of her need for autonomy. The parent might be underestimating the importance of the daughter's privacy and the potential harm in not respecting her wishes. \n\nIn terms of the parent's reasoning, they say they want to do family therapy, but the daughter refuses. Maybe the parent is pushing too hard, and the daughter is reacting to that pressure. The argument that the therapist is okay with it doesn't necessarily mean it's the right choice for the family dynamics. The daughter's distress is a sign that there's an issue here that needs to be addressed, perhaps through a different approach.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might be in the wrong by not fully respecting the daughter's privacy and emotional needs, even if the therapist is okay with it. The parent's desire to seek the same therapist for family therapy might be well-intentioned, but it could be causing harm by not acknowledging the daughter's boundaries. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a different angle.\n"
