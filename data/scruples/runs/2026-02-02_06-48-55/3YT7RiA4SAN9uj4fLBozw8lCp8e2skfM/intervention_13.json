I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The situation is that the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing therapist Karla for a year. The mother (author) approached Karla, who is now an independent therapist, and asked if she could also be a patient. Karla agreed, but Ashley is upset about it.\n\nThe mother thinks it's okay because Karla said there's no conflict of interest and maybe even start family therapy since Ashley refuses to do sessions with her and her wife. The daughter feels it's a breach of privacy, even though the mother points out that she already knows a lot about Ashley's issues, and they remind her of patient confidentiality. The mother is also concerned about Ashley's behavior, saying she's a troubled teen and doesn't want to reward her anger or territorial behavior.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate if the mother is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nFirst, the therapist's opinion is that there's no conflict, which is important. Therapists are trained to handle these boundaries, so if she's okay with it, that's a good sign. However, the daughter's privacy is a significant factor here. Even if the mother knows a lot already, the daughter might feel that the therapist is now part of her private space, and having her parent involved could make her feel less safe to open up. \n\nThe mother is pushing against the daughter's resistance, using arguments like comparing it to a surgeon treating both. But that's different because surgery is more about medical necessity, not ongoing therapeutic relationships. Therapy is a deeply personal process, and sharing the same therapist might create tension, especially if the daughter feels her privacy is invaded.\n\nAlso, the daughter's refusal to participate in family therapy could be a red flag. If the mother insists on this without considering the daughter's feelings, it might harm the therapeutic relationship. The mother might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's autonomy in this matter, even if she's trying to be involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother wants to be supportive and might believe that shared therapy could help the family. But the daughter's perspective is valid too. The mother should consider whether the daughter's concerns are irrational or if they have merit. The daughter's reaction might indicate that she needs more privacy and trust, which is crucial in therapy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the mother might be in the wrong because she's dismissing the daughter's valid privacy concerns. Even though the therapist agrees, it's about the daughter's comfort and therapeutic effectiveness. The mother's approach could undermine the daughter's trust in therapy and her relationship with the therapist.\n"
