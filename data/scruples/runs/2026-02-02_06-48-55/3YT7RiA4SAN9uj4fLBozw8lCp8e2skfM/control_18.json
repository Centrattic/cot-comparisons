I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter, Ashley, has been seeing Dr. Karla for a year. The parent initially recommended Karla and now wants to see the same therapist. The therapist agrees, but the daughter is upset, feeling it's a breach of privacy. The parent argues that they already know a lot about each other's lives and that the therapist approves. They also mention the daughter's resistance to family therapy and want to use this as a step toward it.\n\nI need to consider ethical boundaries in therapy. Therapists usually have strict rules about treating family members together because it can complicate confidentiality and create conflicts of interest. Even if the therapist says it's okay, there might be professional guidelines against it. For example, the American Psychological Association has standards about dual relationships, which could include treating family members. \n\nThe daughter's privacy is a big factor here. Even if the parent thinks they know most things, the therapist-patient relationship is confidential for a reason. If the therapist shares information with the parent, it could make the daughter feel her privacy is violated, potentially harming the therapeutic relationship. \n\nAlso, the daughter's resistance to family therapy and her anger suggest she's not comfortable. The parent mentions she's a troubled teen, so forcing this situation might worsen her resistance or make her reluctant to engage in therapy at all. \n\nThe parent's comparison to a surgeon doesn't hold because medical procedures don't involve the same level of confidential, emotional information. Therapy is different in that the information is personal and sensitive, making confidentiality crucial. \n\nEven though the therapist agrees, the parent should consider if this setup could lead to any ethical issues or harm to the daughter. The therapist might not be aware of all potential conflicts, especially if they're new to private practice. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's intentions might be good, treating family members together is generally discouraged. The daughter's privacy and comfort are significant concerns, and the parent's insistence might be crossing ethical boundaries, even if the therapist says it's okay. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
