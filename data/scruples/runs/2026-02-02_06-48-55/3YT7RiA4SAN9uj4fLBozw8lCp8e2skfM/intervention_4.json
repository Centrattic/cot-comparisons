I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about the privacy breach, the therapist says it's okay, and the parent feels it's reasonable.\n\nFirst, the daughter's perspective is important. She's a teenager, likely going through a lot, and privacy is a big issue during adolescence. Even if the parent knows a lot already, the daughter might feel violated by sharing a therapist. The parent mentions patient confidentiality, but the daughter still resists, which could indicate she's not comfortable with the dynamic. \n\nThe therapist, Karla, says it's okay, but maybe the parent isn't considering the daughter's emotional state here. The daughter's resistance might not just be about privacy; it could be about needing independence, especially if she's troubled. The parent's argument about a surgeon is a bit of a stretch\u2014surgeons don't share personal sessions like therapists do. Family therapy could be a better approach if the daughter is open to it, but the parent is bypassing that by wanting to see the same therapist directly. \n\nThe parent's intention to use this as a way into family therapy is a good point, but maybe the approach is flawed. The daughter's anger and the wife's disapproval suggest there's tension here. The parent might be pushing too hard, not respecting the daughter's boundaries for their own sake. \n\nIn therapy settings, shared therapists can create conflicts, even if the therapist is okay with it. The daughter might feel that her privacy isn't being respected, which could harm her therapeutic progress. The parent's argument that they should be seen as a surgeon example doesn't hold because therapy involves more personal information and trust. \n\nSo, even though the therapist approves, the parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's feelings. The right approach might be to find a different therapist for themselves or explore family therapy first. The parent's actions could be seen as dismissive of the daughter's emotional needs, which might be the root of the problem. Therefore, the parent is likely in the wrong here.\n"
