I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is upset about it, thinks it's a privacy breach. The therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The parent feels it's similar to having the same surgeon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Therapists usually have boundaries to maintain confidentiality. If the therapist is comfortable with both, maybe it's okay. But the daughter's feelings are valid. Privacy is a big deal, especially for teens. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's feelings, even if the therapist approves. The daughter's refusal to do family therapy suggests she's not ready for that. The parent is dismissing her anger as irrational or territorial, which isn't helpful. Also, the parent is using the surgeon analogy, but therapy is different because it involves personal, confidential information. Even though the therapist says it's fine, the daughter's emotional response should be taken seriously. The parent might need to step back and respect her boundaries for the sake of her mental health. So, the answer might be A, the parent is in the wrong because they're not respecting the daughter's privacy concerns despite the therapist's approval.\n"
