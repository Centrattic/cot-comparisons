I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The scenario is that the daughter is uncomfortable with this arrangement, but the therapist, Karla, says it's okay. The parents think the author is in the right, but the daughter is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She feels her privacy is being breached. Even though the father knows a lot, there's patient confidentiality to consider. The therapist might share some information, but the daughter might feel her private issues are being discussed with her parent. That could make her feel uncomfortable or not trust the therapist as much, which isn't helpful for her therapy.\n\nThen, the therapist's stance is important. Karla says it's fine, but the daughter is against it. The therapist might not realize the impact on the daughter's feelings. The father is arguing it's like a surgeon example, but therapy is different because it's more personal and involves emotional issues. The daughter might feel the therapist is now taking sides or that family dynamics are complicating her therapy.\n\nThe father wants to use this as a way to introduce family therapy, but the daughter refuses. Maybe she's not ready for that. Insisting could lead to resistance. The daughter is a teenager, which is a time when they often seek independence and privacy. The father's approach might be seen as overstepping, even if his intentions are good.\n\nOn the other hand, the father has valid reasons too. He trusts Karla and might benefit from therapy, especially given his military experience. But the key issue here is the daughter's consent and comfort. The therapist's approval doesn't override the daughter's feelings. The father needs to respect her boundaries to maintain her trust and cooperation in her own therapy.\n\nThe daughter's anger could be a sign that she's feeling her space is invaded. Even if the father doesn't see a problem, respecting her wishes is crucial for her well-being. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because pushing against the daughter's objections could harm their relationship and her therapy progress.\n"
