I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. The daughter is unhappy about it, arguing it's a privacy breach, but the therapist says it's okay. The author thinks the therapist's approval makes it fine and also sees it as a way to start family therapy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's a teenager, which is a time when privacy is important. Even if the parent knows a lot about her life, the fact that the therapist is now handling both could make her feel her private issues are being shared. The parent mentions the daughter is \"troubled\" and that they want to introduce family therapy, but the daughter refuses sessions with family present. This might mean the daughter is not ready for that step, and forcing the parent to see the same therapist could be seen as a way to bypass her comfort zone.\n\nThe therapist, Karla, says it's okay. But therapists usually have boundaries to avoid conflicts of interest. Even if the therapist is okay, there might be ethical considerations. For example, the therapist might be in a position where they have to manage both the parent's and the daughter's needs, which could complicate the therapeutic relationship for both. The daughter's privacy is a key issue here. Even though the parent claims not to know everything, the daughter feels it's an invasion. The parent's argument about a surgeon is a bit weak because a surgeon's role is different from a therapist's, where confidentiality and individual sessions are crucial.\n\nThe parent might be trying to bond or help, but not respecting the daughter's boundaries could do more harm. The daughter's anger might be a sign that she needs her space. The parent's insistence could be seen as dismissing her feelings as \"irrational,\" which isn't healthy. Even if the therapist says it's okay, the daughter's comfort and consent are important. The parent's approach could undermine the daughter's trust in both the therapist and the parent.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might be in the wrong because they're disregarding the daughter's privacy concerns and pushing their own agenda without fully respecting her boundaries. Family therapy should be a mutual agreement, not forced. The therapist's approval doesn't override the daughter's feelings in this case. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
