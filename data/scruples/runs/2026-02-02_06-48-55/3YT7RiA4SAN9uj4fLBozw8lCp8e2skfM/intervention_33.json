I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist their daughter is seeing. The daughter objects, thinking it's a privacy breach. The therapist says it's okay, but the daughter is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The parent introduced the daughter to the therapist initially, and now the parent wants to become a client too. The daughter feels her privacy is invaded, even though the therapist says there's no conflict. The parent is pushing back, saying they want to respect the daughter's feelings but also not give in to her anger. The parent mentions that the daughter refuses family therapy sessions with them present, so they see this as a way to start family therapy.\n\nThe parent's argument is that the therapist has approved it, and that it's not different from being treated by the same surgeon. The daughter's concern is about privacy, which is a valid point. However, the parent is dismissing her feelings as irrational or territorial, which might not be the best approach. \n\nI should consider both sides. The parent is trying to address their own mental health needs, which is important. But the daughter's privacy and comfort are also significant. Even if the therapist says there's no conflict, the daughter's emotional reaction shouldn't be ignored. The parent is in a position of authority (as a parent), so their decision could impact the daughter's willingness to engage in therapy. \n\nAlso, the parent is using a comparison to a surgeon, which might not be the best analogy. Surgeons don't typically share the same patient's medical details with family unless it's necessary. In therapy, confidentiality is a key component. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the daughter's objection is about trust and control over her own treatment. \n\nThe parent might be overstepping by not fully respecting the daughter's boundaries. Even if they have good intentions, the daughter's feelings are valid. The parent should consider alternative solutions, like family therapy with separate sessions, or finding a different therapist for themselves. Insisting on the same therapist could damage the therapeutic relationship for the daughter, making her less likely to open up. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent might be in the wrong here because they're not adequately respecting the daughter's privacy and emotional needs. The therapist's approval is part of it, but the daughter's feelings are more about personal boundaries. The parent's approach could be seen as dismissive of her valid concerns, which is why the answer might be A (in the wrong).\n"
