I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the parent wants to see the same therapist as their daughter. The therapist, Karla, agrees it's okay. But the daughter is upset because she thinks it's a breach of privacy. The parent mentions the daughter is a typical teenager and has been through a lot, and they want to use this as an introduction to family therapy since the daughter refuses to have sessions with the parent and wife present.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the daughter's perspective. She's probably feeling that her privacy is being invaded. Even though the parent argues that they already know a lot and that patient confidentiality protects some things, the daughter might feel uncomfortable knowing her parent is also seeing the same therapist. There could be emotional reasons she's resistant, like fear of judgment, feeling like she can't open up as much, or maybe even feeling that the therapist is now partially \"hers\" and the parent is taking over. \n\nThen, the parent's argument is that Karla, the therapist, is okay with it. But just because the therapist says it's fine doesn't mean it's the best for the daughter. Therapists might have professional boundaries they're trained to maintain, but they might not always see the personal dynamics between family members. The parent is pushing back against the daughter's anger, seeing it as irrational or territorial, but teenagers often act out in ways that seem irrational, and their feelings are valid even if not logical. \n\nThe parent also wants to use this as a step towards family therapy. However, if the daughter is resistant, forcing the issue might not be helpful. Family therapy should ideally be a mutual agreement, not something imposed. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting the daughter's current boundaries, even if they have good intentions. \n\nAnother angle is the potential conflict of interest. Even though the therapist says it's okay, having the parent and child both under the same therapist might create complications. The therapist might find it hard to maintain impartiality or the daughter might feel pressured to share things that are difficult. The parent's military background and experience might lead them to take a more authoritative approach, which could clash with the daughter's need for autonomy.\n\nI should also consider professional guidelines. Therapists usually avoid dual relationships where they have ties to both family members to prevent boundary issues. If Karla agreed, maybe she's aware of these guidelines and thinks she can handle it, but the daughter's well-being is the main concern here. The parent might be prioritizing their own needs or their vision of family therapy without considering the daughter's emotional state.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent is trying to involve the therapist in a way that the daughter feels is an invasion of privacy. Even if the therapist is okay with it, the parent might not be respecting the daughter's boundaries, which are important in therapeutic relationships. The parent's actions could be seen as TA because they're not adequately addressing the daughter's valid concerns and instead dismissing them as anger or irrationality.\n"
