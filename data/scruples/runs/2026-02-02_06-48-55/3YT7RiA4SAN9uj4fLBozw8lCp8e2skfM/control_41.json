I met her therapist (Karla) back when she used to work through our on-base hospital (we're military) though she wasn't my therapist my daughter needed one and I thought she'd be perfect. So I sent her to one of her teen group counseling sessions and she really liked it and eventually started seeing her one on one.\n\nNow Karla works independently and her new office is beautiful. She can also see all sorts of patients now and she's probably the only therapist I trust and she's been very inclusive with me in my daughter's progress so I asked her if there would be any conflict of interest in her seeing me too and she said no and that she'd be totally fine with seeing me too.\n\nMy daughter however is not fine with it. She thinks it'd be a breach of her privacy. I kind of get it but there's not much I don't already know (aside from stuff that falls under patient confidentiality which I reminded her is a thing) but other than that she can't really give me a reason even though I've challenged her to give me one several times to do so. She is a typical teenaged girl in some ways but rather troubled to boot so while I want to respect her feelings I also don't want to give into her anger or reward irrational or territorial behavior. She has been through a lot and so have I over my tours and I told her it's no different from us being operated on by the same skilled surgeon to which she has nothing to say. In fact i feel like this would be a good introduction to family therapy as right now my daughter refuses to do a therapy session with me and/or my wife present.\n\nMy wife and obviously my daughter think I'm TA but I feel like Karla would know if there was something wrong with it in her professional opinion and she thinks it's fine.\n\ntl;dr My daughter is angry because I want t see the same therapist she does, therapist is fine with it.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to see the same therapist as their daughter. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter, Ashley, has been seeing a therapist named Karla for a year. The author (the parent) met Karla through the military hospital and later sent Ashley to her group sessions. Now Karla works independently, and the author wants to see her too. The daughter is upset about this, feeling it's a privacy breach. The therapist says it's okay, and the parent thinks family therapy might help since Ashley refuses sessions with the parent or spouse present.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that they want to use the therapist they trust, and since the therapist approved, maybe it's fine. They also compare it to having the same surgeon, implying it's a skilled professional who can help both. However, the daughter is uncomfortable, which the parent acknowledges but challenges as irrational.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: \n\n1. **Confidentiality**: Therapists are bound by confidentiality laws. If the parent and daughter both see Karla, how does that affect each person's confidentiality? The daughter might feel that her private issues are being discussed with someone who also knows the parent, which could make her less open in therapy. Even if the therapist is professional, the daughter's comfort is crucial for effective therapy.\n\n2. **Therapist's Boundaries**: The therapist might say it's okay, but ethical guidelines (like those from the APA) often caution against multiple relationships to avoid conflicts. The therapist might not have a conflict, but the situation could create tension if boundaries aren't carefully managed.\n\n3. **Daughter's Feelings**: The parent dismisses the daughter's privacy concerns as \"irrational\" or \"territorial.\" However, adolescents often struggle with seeking independence and might see their parent seeing the same therapist as an intrusion. The daughter's refusal to participate in family therapy might be a sign that she's not ready for that dynamic, which the parent is trying to force.\n\n4. **Parent's Intentions**: The parent wants to use a trusted therapist and possibly start family therapy. However, pushing through despite the daughter's objections might undermine the daughter's autonomy. The parent should consider whether the daughter's resistance is valid and needs to be respected, even if the parent doesn't fully understand it.\n\n5. **Professional Judgment**: The therapist's approval is important, but it's also about whether the arrangement is in both the parent's and daughter's best interests. If the daughter is not in therapy with the parent present, maybe individual family therapy sessions (with the parent and spouse) could be a middle ground, instead of seeing the same therapist.\n\nConsidering all this, while the parent has valid reasons, the daughter's privacy and consent are significant. The parent might not be entirely wrong, but the way they're dismissing the daughter's feelings as irrational could be problematic. The therapist's approval is a point in their favor, but the potential for conflict of interest and the daughter's emotional well-being need to be weighed. So, the parent's action isn't necessarily wrong, but the approach and respect for the daughter's boundaries might be lacking. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the therapist is okay with it and the parent is acting in good faith, maybe not. But if the daughter's concerns are valid and the parent isn't respecting them, then they might be. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the therapist approved and the parent has legitimate reasons, but there's a need to consider the daughter's feelings more carefully.\n"
