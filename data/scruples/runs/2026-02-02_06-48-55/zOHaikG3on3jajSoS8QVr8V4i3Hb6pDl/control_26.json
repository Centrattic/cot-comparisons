So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the two main points. The first one is about smokers. The author doesn't want them to hold the baby even if they've washed their hands because they smoke a pack a day. They mention that the smokers are near the baby's bouncer by the front door, so maybe the smoke is lingering on their clothes or in the house. The author is told they're a \"bitch\" for not allowing this. \n\nSecond, the author refuses to let people near the baby if they haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Some people argue that the updated vaccine isn't necessary, so they don't get it. \n\nI should consider the health and safety of the baby. For smoking, secondhand smoke is a known hazard for infants. Even if someone washes their hands and showers, the smoke can stick to their clothing and hair, exposing the baby to it. Health organizations like the AAP recommend avoiding secondhand smoke around babies. So the author's stance here might be justified for the baby's well-being.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, the Tdap vaccine is typically recommended for adults to protect against pertussis, which is very dangerous for infants. The updated vaccine is important because immunity can wane over time. The author is probably following medical advice to protect their vulnerable baby. People who haven't updated their vaccines might be at risk of carrying the bacteria, even if they were vaccinated as children. \n\nNow, the other people in the scenario are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is hurtful, but the author's concerns are based on protecting their child from preventable health risks. The author is taking precautions that align with pediatric guidelines. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a health perspective, both decisions seem reasonable. Socially, it might cause tension, but the primary responsibility of a parent is to protect their child. So the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on health and safety, even if others are offended.\n"
