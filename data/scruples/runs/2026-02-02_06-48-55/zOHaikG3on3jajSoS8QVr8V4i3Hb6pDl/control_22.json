So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the parent) is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The two main reasons given are avoiding smokers and requiring the Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The parent is concerned about secondhand smoke and the smell. Even if the people wash their hands and shower, the parent is worried about the smell lingering on their clothes or in the environment. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants, right? The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations do recommend keeping infants away from secondhand smoke. So from a health perspective, the parent has a valid reason. But the people in question are calling the parent a \"bitch,\" which seems judgmental and maybe dismissive of the health concerns. So maybe the parent isn't in the wrong here.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine. The parent requires the updated vaccine. Whooping Cough is a serious illness for infants, who can't be vaccinated until they're a few months old. Being around unvaccinated people could pose a risk. The people say they don't need the updated vaccine, but the parent is being cautious. Again, from a health standpoint, this is a common precaution. The CDC recommends the Tdap vaccine for adults who haven't had it, especially those around infants. So the parent's stance here is supported by medical advice.\n\nThe parent is also taking active steps to avoid these people in their home. The question is whether this exclusion is unreasonable. Health precautions for a newborn are often taken seriously, especially when it comes to preventing infections and exposure to harmful substances. The parent's actions are protective measures based on medical guidelines. The fact that others are upset and call them names suggests a lack of understanding or empathy, not that the parent is wrong.\n\nSo putting this together, the parent is taking reasonable steps to protect their child's health. The people in question might not be malicious, but their actions (smoking, not getting vaccinated) do pose risks. The parent isn't being inconsiderate; they're prioritizing their baby's safety. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
