So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are refusing smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. \n\nFirst, regarding the smokers: The author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke. Even if they've washed their hands or showered, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and skin. Secondhand smoke is a known health risk, especially for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding secondhand smoke exposure for babies. So from a health perspective, the author's stance makes sense.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine. The author requires the updated vaccine. Whooping Cough can be deadly for infants, and the vaccine is crucial. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, they might not be protected, increasing the risk of spreading the disease. The CDC emphasizes vaccination for anyone in close contact with infants. \n\nThe author is protecting their child from preventable risks. The people they're excluding are making arguments that don't address the actual health concerns\u2014like washing hands or showering not removing smoke residue, and not understanding the necessity of the updated vaccine. \n\nThe author's actions are about their child's safety, which is a parent's responsibility. The judgment from others (\"you're a bitch\") seems unfair because they're not considering the health risks. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they're making reasonable decisions for their baby's well-being.\n"
