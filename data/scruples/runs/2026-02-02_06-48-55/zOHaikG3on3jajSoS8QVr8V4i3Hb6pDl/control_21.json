So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are the smoker issue and the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold their baby. They explain that even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell of smoke can linger, and they also smoke near the baby's bouncer. The smokers argue that they've washed their hands and shower daily, so the author is being a \"bitch.\" The author avoids these people.\n\nThen there's the vaccination part. The author requires the updated whooping cough vaccine, but some people haven't gotten it, saying they don't need the update. The author doesn't let them near the baby.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. So, from a health and safety perspective, secondhand smoke is harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics definitely advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. So the author has a valid reason there. The smokers might not realize how dangerous it is, or they might be defensive about their habits. The author's stance is about protecting their baby's health, which is a parent's right.\n\nRegarding the vaccine, whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants, especially under six months. Even if someone had the vaccine before, the protection wanes over time. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults, especially those around infants. So the author is taking a precaution to protect their baby, which is a common practice. The people not updating their vaccine might not be aware of the recommendations or choose to ignore them, but the author has the right to set boundaries to keep their baby safe.\n\nThe author is facing criticism from others, but their decisions are based on medical advice. It's their responsibility to prioritize their child's well-being. People might take it personally, but the author isn't obligated to let others hold their baby if they're concerned about health risks. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
