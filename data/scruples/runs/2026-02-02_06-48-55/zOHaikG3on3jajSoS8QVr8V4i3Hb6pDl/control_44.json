So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author has set boundaries but others are calling them a \"bitch\" for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author doesn't want smokers around the baby because of secondhand smoke and the smell. I know that secondhand smoke is a serious health risk for infants, increasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and other issues. Even if someone washes their hands or showers, the smoke in the environment could still affect the baby if they're near the door where the baby's bouncer is. So that part seems like a valid health concern.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis) is dangerous for infants, especially under six months. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in close contact with babies. If people haven't updated their vaccine, they could be at risk of carrying the bacteria, even if they had it before. The author is being cautious to protect the baby from a preventable disease. Again, this seems like a reasonable precaution.\n\nThe other people are criticizing the author for being difficult. But from a health and safety perspective, protecting a newborn is a priority. The author is setting boundaries to avoid exposing the baby to risks. It's not just about the author's preferences but actual health risks. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for their stance, and others should respect those boundaries rather than judge them. The answer should be B (No).\n"
