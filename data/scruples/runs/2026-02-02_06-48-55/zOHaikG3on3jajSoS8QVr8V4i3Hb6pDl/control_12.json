So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter due to smoking and lack of whooping cough vaccination.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke, which is a legitimate health risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, strongly advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can lead to serious health issues like respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and more. So, not allowing smokers to hold the baby seems reasonable from a medical standpoint.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccination. Whooping cough can be life-threatening for infants, especially those under six months old. The updated vaccine is important because immunity can wane over time. Even if someone had the vaccine in the past, without the updated one, they might still be susceptible to the disease and could pass it to the baby. So, requiring the updated vaccine is a common precaution among parents with young children.\n\nThe author mentions that others are calling them a \"bitch\" for these restrictions. However, the author's decisions are based on protecting their child's health, not personal dislike. It's important to distinguish between health protocols and social judgments. The people in question might not realize the severity of the risks involved, or they might be defensive about their habits.\n\nAnother angle is the social aspect. The author is going out of their way to avoid these people, which could strain relationships. However, prioritizing the baby's well-being over social interactions is understandable. It's the parent's responsibility to create a safe environment for their child, even if it means setting boundaries that others find uncomfortable.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some communities, such restrictions might be seen as overly cautious, but in terms of medical advice, they are justified. The key here is that the author is acting in their child's best interest based on medical recommendations, not on personal bias or discrimination.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are based on valid health concerns. They have provided clear reasons for their decisions, which are supported by medical guidelines. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for setting these boundaries to protect their infant.\n"
