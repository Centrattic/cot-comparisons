So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author has two main reasons: they don't want smokers to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke and the smell, and they don't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby. The people in question are upset, calling the author a \"bitch,\" and argue that they wash their hands and shower, and that the vaccine isn't necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other health organizations warn that even trace amounts of smoke can be harmful. Residual smoke particles can linger on clothing and skin, so just washing hands might not eliminate the risk. The author's concern here is valid.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine, the AAP recommends that all adults and teens in close contact with infants get the Tdap vaccine. Whooping Cough can be deadly for newborns. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccine, the author has a right to be cautious. The argument that the vaccine isn't necessary might stem from misinformation, but the author is prioritizing the baby's safety.\n\nNow, the criticism from others: calling the author a \"bitch\" and dismissing their concerns. The author is setting boundaries based on legitimate health risks. It's understandable that the author is avoiding these people to protect their child. The people's reaction might be based on not understanding the medical reasons or feeling slighted, but the author's actions are in the baby's best interest.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is making decisions to protect their child from preventable health risks. The people in question aren't respecting those boundaries, but the author isn't at fault for setting them. It's their right as a parent to prioritize their child's health. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
