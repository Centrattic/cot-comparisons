So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The author is a new parent who doesn't want certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are that some people smoke and haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Smoke exposure is harmful to infants. Even if someone washes their hands or showers, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and skin. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for respiratory issues in babies, so the author's concern is valid. It's not just about their own hygiene but the actual health risks involved. \n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants, especially those under six months. The bacteria can be spread even by asymptomatic carriers. The author is requiring the updated vaccine, which is a common precaution taken by parents to protect their babies. If some people refuse to get the updated vaccine, the author's decision to keep them away is a protective measure.\n\nNow, the others are calling the author a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries. That's a bit harsh. The author has the right to set limits to protect their child. People might not agree, but it's their choice as a parent. The fact that the author is going out of their way to avoid these people in their homes is about creating a safe environment for the baby. \n\nAre there any other factors? Maybe the social aspect. The author might be limiting their social interactions, but the health of the baby is a priority. The people in question might feel excluded, but the author's stance is about health, not personal dislike. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They are making responsible decisions based on medical advice and their child's well-being. The people who criticize the author are not respecting the parent's choices. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
