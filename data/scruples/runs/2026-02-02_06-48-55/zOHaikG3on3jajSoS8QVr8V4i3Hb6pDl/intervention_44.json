So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the article is in the wrong. The situation is about a new parent who doesn't want smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author explains their reasons: not wanting the baby to smell smoke or be exposed to secondhand smoke, and protecting from whooping cough. Other people are criticizing them as a \"bitch\" even though the author is taking precautions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, linked to SIDS, respiratory issues, etc. The CDC and other health organizations recommend avoiding any exposure. So the author's stance on smokers seems reasonable. As for the whooping cough vaccine, pertussis is serious for infants, and the Tdap vaccine is recommended for anyone in close contact with a baby. Those who haven't updated their vaccine might pose a risk. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making choices that affect social interactions. They're avoiding people, which might be seen as excluding friends or family. But the health of the baby is a primary concern. The people in question are smokers and unvaccinated individuals, and they're dismissing the author's concerns despite the health advice. The author isn't being mean for no reason; they have valid, health-based reasons. \n\nThe people criticizing the author might be prioritizing their own habits over the baby's well-being. The author's actions are protective, not malicious. So the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. For example, are the smokers washing their hands enough? The author says they smoke a pack a day and near the front door where the baby's bouncer is. Even washing hands might not eliminate the smell or all toxins. So the author's precautions are justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
