So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for advice on whether they're at fault for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main issues are smoking and lack of the updated whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby. They mentioned that even if the smokers wash their hands, they still want to avoid the smell of smoke on the baby. Also, the smokers are near the front door where the baby's bouncer is. The author is also strict about whooping cough vaccines. Some people they know haven't had the updated one, even though they have other vaccines. They're told that the updated vaccine isn't necessary, but the author still won't allow those people near the baby.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. From a health perspective, secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises against exposing children to secondhand smoke because it can lead to respiratory issues, SIDS, and other problems. So, the author's concern there is valid. Even if the smokers are clean, the residual smoke in their hair, clothing, and environment is a risk. So maybe that part is reasonable.\n\nRegarding the whooping cough vaccine, the pertussis vaccine (DTaP or Tdap) is recommended for adults, especially those who will be around infants. Whooping cough can be deadly for babies. The AAP and CDC recommend that people in close contact with infants should get a Tdap shot if they haven't already. If some people haven't updated their vaccine, the author is right to be cautious. Pertussis is highly contagious and severe in infants.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child, which is a parent's right. However, the friends or family members are upset, calling the author a \"bitch.\" That's where the conflict arises. The author is being firm about their rules, which might be seen as excluding people, but they have legitimate health reasons.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I don't think so. They're acting in their child's best interest based on medical advice. The people they're excluding might not understand the risks or are dismissive, but the author has the right to prioritize their baby's safety. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
