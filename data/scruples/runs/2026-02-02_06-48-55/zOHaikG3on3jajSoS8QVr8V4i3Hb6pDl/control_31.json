So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are that some people smoke a pack a day and others haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. The author explains their reasons clearly, but others are calling them a bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can lead to respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other problems. So from a medical standpoint, the author's concern about smokers is valid.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, pertussis is a serious disease for infants, especially those under six months. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, and boosters are advised every 10 years. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccination, they might pose a risk to the baby. Public health guidelines support keeping unvaccinated individuals away from infants to prevent the spread of diseases like pertussis, which can be deadly for young babies.\n\nNow, the author is being criticized for being a \"bitch.\" But protecting one's child from preventable health risks is a parent's right. The people who are smokers or unvaccinated are making choices that could endanger the baby, and the author is setting boundaries to protect their child. The fact that smokers wash their hands or shower doesn't eliminate the risk of secondhand smoke, which lingers on clothing and in the environment. Similarly, vaccination status isn't something that can be mitigated by hygiene; it's a medical necessity for disease prevention.\n\nThe author is taking proactive steps to ensure their child's safety, which is a responsible action. The criticism they're facing from others seems to stem from misunderstanding or not valuing the health risks enough. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for setting these boundaries based on valid health concerns.\n"
