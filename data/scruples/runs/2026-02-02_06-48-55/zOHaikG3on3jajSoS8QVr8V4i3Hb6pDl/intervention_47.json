So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The main points are about not allowing smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, smoking. The author doesn't want smokers near their baby because of secondhand smoke and the smell. Even though the smokers wash their hands and shower daily, the author is concerned about the lingering smoke smell and the health risks. The smokers call the author a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries. The question is whether the author is wrong here. Well, secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, especially for infants. The CDC and other health organizations recommend keeping infants away from smokers to prevent health issues. So, the author's stance here is medically supported. The smokers might be defensive, but the author's right to protect their child should be respected.\n\nNext, the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious illness for infants, who can't be vaccinated until they're a few months old. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect babies. If people haven't had the updated vaccine, they might be a risk. The author's decision to avoid them is about preventing disease. Again, public health guidelines support this, as whooping cough can be deadly for infants. The others dismissing the need for the vaccine might not realize the severity, but the author is prioritizing their child's safety.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. While it might be uncomfortable for the other people, the health risks are real. The key here is whether the author's actions are reasonable. Since both smoking and unvaccinated individuals pose documented risks to infants, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to enforce these rules in their home. The other people's reactions might stem from not understanding the medical reasons, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
