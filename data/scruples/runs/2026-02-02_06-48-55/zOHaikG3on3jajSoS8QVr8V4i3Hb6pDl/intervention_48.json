So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the whooping cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They mention not wanting secondhand smoke on the baby or the risk of pertussis. The author is getting criticized for being a \"bitch\" for these restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider health and safety. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend avoiding secondhand smoke around babies because it increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and other issues. So, the author's concern there is valid from a medical standpoint.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Pertussis is a serious respiratory illness that can be deadly in infants. The Tdap vaccine, which includes protection against pertussis, is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those who will be around babies. The author is requiring the updated vaccine, which is a reasonable precaution. People who haven't been vaccinated or updated could pose a risk, even if they were vaccinated in the past.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding these people, which others are calling inconsiderate. But the author is prioritizing their child's health. The question is whether their stance is reasonable. Since medical guidelines support avoiding secondhand smoke and ensuring up-to-date vaccines for those around infants, the author's actions seem justified.\n\nThe people criticizing them argue that washing hands or showering is enough for smokers, but smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on clothing and skin. So even if someone washes their hands, the smell and chemicals from smoke can still be transferred. And regarding the vaccine, if the people aren't up to date, they might not realize the importance, but that doesn't negate the risk.\n\nSo, from a health perspective, the author is making decisions to protect their child. It's their right to set these boundaries, especially when medical advice supports it. The criticism they're facing seems misplaced. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
