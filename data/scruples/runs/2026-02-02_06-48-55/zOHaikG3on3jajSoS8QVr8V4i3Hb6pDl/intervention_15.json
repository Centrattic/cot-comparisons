So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding their stance on who can hold their two-month-old daughter. The author has two main concerns: not allowing smokers near the baby and requiring the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby even if they wash their hands, because of the smell and secondhand smoke. They also mention that these people smoke near the front door, which is close to the baby's bouncer. The people in question argue that they wash their hands and shower daily, so the author shouldn't be a \"bitch.\" The author avoids their houses because of this.\n\nI know that secondhand smoke is harmful, especially to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, recommends no exposure to secondhand smoke for babies. So from a health perspective, the author has a valid concern. The people's argument about washing hands and showering might not address the actual risk of secondhand smoke exposure. The smell clinging to clothes is another valid point because it can lead to passive exposure.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis is a serious disease for infants, who can get severe complications or even die. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in contact with babies. The author is requiring the updated vaccine, but some friends don't think it's necessary. The CDC does recommend a Tdap booster for adults, so the author's stance is medically sound here.\n\nThe author's friends are calling them a \"bitch,\" which is a bit harsh. But the author's reasons are based on protecting the baby's health. The friends' arguments might be dismissing the actual health risks for the sake of their own convenience or habits. The author's actions\u2014avoiding their homes to prevent the baby from being exposed\u2014are a way to enforce their boundaries, which seems reasonable given the health concerns.\n\nSo considering the medical guidelines and the potential risks, the author's decisions are justified. They are prioritizing their baby's health, which is a parent's primary responsibility. The friends' responses don't address the actual health issues but instead focus on the author's perceived harshness. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
