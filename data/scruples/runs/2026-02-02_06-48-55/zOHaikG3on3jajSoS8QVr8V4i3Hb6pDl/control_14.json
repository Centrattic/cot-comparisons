So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author had a baby two months ago and is setting boundaries around who can hold her. They don't want smokers to hold the baby because of the smell and secondhand smoke, even if the smokers have washed their hands. Also, they require the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine for visitors.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke, which is a health risk for infants. The AAP and other health organizations do recommend avoiding smoke around babies. So from a health perspective, the author has a valid reason. The smokers might argue they've washed their hands, but smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on skin, hair, and clothes. So the author's stance is reasonable to protect the baby's health.\n\nThen there's the pertussis vaccine. Whooping cough is serious for infants, and while the vaccine's effectiveness can wane over time, the Tdap booster is recommended for adults. If some people haven't had the updated vaccine, the author is trying to prevent a preventable risk. The argument from others that they don't need the update might be based on misinformation. The author is acting in the baby's best interest here.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries by not allowing these people into their home. The response from others calling them a \"bitch\" is unkind, but the author's concerns are legitimate. They're prioritizing their child's health, which is a parent's right. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No), because their actions are protective and health-based, even if others find it inconvenient or unfair.\n"
