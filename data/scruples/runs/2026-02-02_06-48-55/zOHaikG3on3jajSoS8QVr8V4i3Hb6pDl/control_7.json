So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the author's reasons. They don't want smokers to hold the baby even if they've washed their hands. Their concerns are about the smell and secondhand smoke. The smokers in question are told they smoke a pack a day near the front door, which is close to the baby's bouncer. The author avoids these people. Then there's the whooping cough vaccine issue. The author requires the updated vaccine, but some people don't get it, thinking it's not necessary.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is being unreasonable. For the smoking part, while washing hands is important, secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, especially for infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smoke particles can linger on clothing and in the environment. The American Academy of Pediatrics does advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. So, the author's stance seems medically justified.\n\nOn the vaccination side, whooping cough (pertussis) is very dangerous for infants. The whooping cough vaccine is part of the DTaP series, which is recommended for all caregivers. The author is concerned about the updated vaccine, which might refer to the Tdap booster recommended for adults. The AAP and CDC recommend that anyone in close contact with infants should get the Tdap vaccine. If the people in question haven't had the updated vaccine, the author is protecting the baby from a serious risk. \n\nThe other people are calling the author a \"bitch,\" but that seems harsh. The author's decisions are based on health and safety, which are valid. The smokers' argument about handwashing and showering doesn't address the actual risk of secondhand smoke. Similarly, the vaccination argument is about preventing a life-threatening disease, which is a legitimate precaution.\n\nSo, putting it together, the author's actions are based on reasonable health concerns. The people they're excluding are contributing to the risk by not following these safety measures. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
