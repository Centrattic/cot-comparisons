So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter due to smoking and lack of whooping cough vaccination. They've explained their reasons\u2014avoiding secondhand smoke exposure and ensuring protection against whooping cough. However, others are calling them a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, contributing to respiratory issues and other health problems. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend avoiding secondhand smoke around babies. So from a medical standpoint, the author has valid concerns. \n\nRegarding the whooping cough vaccine, the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those around infants. Pertussis (whooping cough) can be severe in babies, and the vaccine's protection wanes over time, so updated vaccinations are important. The author's insistence on this might be medically justified.\n\nNow, the social aspect. The author is setting boundaries by not allowing these people near their child. The others are upset, calling the author names, which suggests they feel their actions are being unfairly judged. But the author is not saying they can't have any contact, just not to hold the baby. This is a reasonable precaution to protect the child's health.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's reasons are based on valid health concerns and they are clearly communicated, then they're not being unreasonable. However, if the author is being judgmental without explaining their reasons, it might be different. Here, the author does explain their reasoning, so it's more about protecting health rather than personal dislike.\n\nSo, considering the health risks and the author's right to protect their child, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The other people's reactions might stem from not understanding the health risks, but the author is justified in their decisions.\n"
