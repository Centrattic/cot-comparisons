So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. The author mentions not allowing smokers because of secondhand smoke. From a health perspective, secondhand smoke is dangerous for infants, even if the person has washed their hands. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke for infants. So, the author's concern is valid on that point. \n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious respiratory infection that can be life-threatening for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had the booster, especially those who will be around babies. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccine, the author is justified in being cautious. \n\nBut the author is being called a \"bitch\" by others. The key here is that the author is setting boundaries based on health concerns. It's their right to protect their child. However, the author is avoiding people entirely, which might be seen as extreme by some. But given the potential health risks, it's a reasonable precaution. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But based on health guidelines, the author's decisions are supported. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong). However, I need to make sure there's no cultural or situational nuance I'm missing. For example, maybe the smokers are family, and the author's approach is causing family conflict. But the question is about right or wrong in terms of health and safety. The answer remains B because the author's concerns are valid.\n"
