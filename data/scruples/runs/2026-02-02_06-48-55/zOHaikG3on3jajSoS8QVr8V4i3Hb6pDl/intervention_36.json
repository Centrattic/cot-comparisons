So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a new parent with a two-month-old daughter. They don't want smokers to hold their baby, even if they've washed their hands, because of the smell and secondhand smoke. They also don't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby. The other people are calling the author a \"bitch\" for not letting them hold the baby, arguing that they take hygiene measures like washing hands and showering. The author avoids these people's houses as well.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: they don't want secondhand smoke exposure and want to prevent whooping cough. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants, increasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory infections, and more. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend avoiding secondhand smoke around babies. So from a health perspective, the author's stance is supported by medical guidelines.\n\nRegarding the vaccine, whooping cough (pertussis) is highly contagious and can be deadly for infants too young to be fully vaccinated. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect against pertussis, especially those in close contact with infants. If these people haven't updated their vaccine, they could be a risk. The CDC recommends the Tdap vaccine for adults who haven't had it, especially if they'll be around babies. So the author's concern here is valid from a medical standpoint.\n\nThe other people are being judgmental, calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is not appropriate. Just because they take certain hygiene steps doesn't negate the health risks. Smokers can still have nicotine residue on their skin and hair even after washing hands or showering. The smell is an indicator of nicotine, not just smoke. Secondhand smoke in the home or near the baby's area is a valid concern.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. It's their responsibility as a parent to make decisions based on medical advice. The people in question might not agree, but their criticism isn't justified if they're putting the baby at risk. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their child's well-being over others' feelings or habits.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have valid, health-based reasons for their decisions, and the criticism from others is unwarranted.\n"
