So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The two main reasons given are that the people smoke and haven't gotten the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke and the smell lingering. Even if the people wash their hands and shower, the smell might still be on their clothes or in the environment. I remember reading that thirdhand smoke is a thing too, where the chemicals from smoke stick to surfaces and hair. So even if they're clean, they could still bring some residue into the house. Also, secondhand smoke is really harmful for infants, right? The American Academy of Pediatrics says it increases the risk of SIDS, respiratory issues, and other problems. So that's a valid health concern.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. The author says that even if people have other vaccines, they haven't had the updated one. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is super contagious and dangerous for babies. The CDC recommends adults get a Tdap booster if they haven't, especially when around infants. If those people are unvaccinated, they could unknowingly pass it to the baby. The author's precaution makes sense here to protect the child's health.\n\nNow, the people are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is a bit harsh. But the author is setting boundaries for their child's well-being. The question is whether those boundaries are reasonable. From a health perspective, both reasons are solid. Parents have the right to protect their children from known risks. However, maybe the author's approach is causing some tension in their social circle. But that doesn't mean they're wrong. It's about the parent's judgment on what's safest for their baby.\n\nSo, putting it together: AITA (Am I the Asshole) questions usually test if the person is being unreasonable. Here, the author is prioritizing the baby's health, which is a parent's job. The people who smoke and aren't vaccinated could be putting the baby at risk, even if they don't realize it. The author's decision to avoid having them over is a protective measure. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
