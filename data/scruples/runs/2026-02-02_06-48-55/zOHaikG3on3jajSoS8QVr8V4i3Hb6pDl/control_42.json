So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers around the baby. They mention that even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes and the baby might be exposed to secondhand smoke. The smokers argue that washing hands and showering daily is enough. But I know that secondhand smoke is a real health risk for infants, right? It can cause respiratory issues, so the author's concern is valid. Also, the smell of smoke on clothing can irritate a baby's senses. So the author is protecting the baby's health here.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. The author requires people to have the updated vaccine, but some people don't. Whooping Cough can be deadly for infants, especially since their immune systems are not fully developed. Even if others don't think the updated vaccine is necessary, the author is taking a precaution. It's a matter of preventing serious illness.\n\nThe author is also avoiding people who don't meet these criteria, which some are calling them a \"bitch.\" But the author is acting in their child's best interest. The people in question might not realize the severity of these health risks. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're making informed decisions to protect their newborn. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
