So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby. The reasoning is about secondhand smoke and the smell. Even though the smokers wash their hands and shower, the author is concerned about the smell transferring and the health risks. Then there's the vaccine part\u2014Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious issue for infants. The author requires the updated vaccine, but some people don't have it, claiming it's not necessary.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break it down.\n\nHealth and safety are primary concerns for newborns. Secondhand smoke is a known risk; the American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations advise against exposing infants to it. The smell might be an issue, but the main risk is the actual smoke, not just the smell. If the smokers are near the baby's bouncer, that's a direct risk. So the author's stance on not allowing smokers around the baby seems medically justified.\n\nWhooping Cough is also a big deal. Pertussis can be life-threatening for infants, especially under six months. The vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time, so updates are important. If people haven't had the updated vaccine, they could be asymptomatic carriers. The author's precaution here is about preventing a potentially deadly disease. The fact that others claim it's not necessary might be misinformation. The author is acting in the baby's best interest.\n\nThe other people are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is harsh. They might feel it's unfair, but the author's reasons are health-based. The smokers' hygiene (washing hands, showering) is irrelevant if the issue is the smoke itself. The author isn't being mean-spirited; they're protecting a vulnerable baby.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decisions are based on valid health concerns. The people they're excluding are making choices (smoking, not updating vaccines) that pose risks. The author isn't in the wrong; they're prioritizing their child's safety. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
