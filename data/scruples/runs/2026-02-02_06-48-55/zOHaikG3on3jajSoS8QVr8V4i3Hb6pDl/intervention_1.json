So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for not allowing smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author doesn't want smokers near the baby because of secondhand smoke exposure, even if they wash their hands. They also don't allow people without the updated whooping cough vaccine. Others are calling them a \"bitch,\" arguing that washing hands and showering should be enough.\n\nI should start by evaluating the health risks. Secondhand smoke is known to be harmful to infants, increasing the risk of respiratory issues, SIDS, etc. The American Academy of Pediatrics definitely advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. So from a health perspective, the author's stance makes sense. Even if someone washes their hands, their clothing might still carry smoke residues, which can be inhaled by the baby.\n\nRegarding the whooping cough vaccine (pertussis), the Tdap vaccine is recommended for anyone in close contact with an infant. Whooping cough can be life-threatening for young babies. The author's requirement for the updated vaccine is a precaution to protect the child, which is medically supported.\n\nThe other side is about personal hygiene. The author mentions that some people smoke near the front door where the baby's bouncer is. That's another risk because smoke lingers in the air and on surfaces. The people being excluded might argue that showering and washing hands mitigate the risk, but medical guidelines suggest that those measures aren't sufficient to eliminate the risk entirely.\n\nNow, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions. I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. From a medical standpoint, both stances (avoiding smokers and ensuring vaccinations) are protective measures. The author's reasons are health-based, which are valid. The social backlash they're facing from others is about social norms versus personal health decisions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions are based on legitimate health concerns supported by medical evidence, then they aren't in the wrong. The other people's criticism that they're being a \"bitch\" is more about social judgment rather than health facts. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's decisions are medically advisable. They have the right to protect their child's health, even if it means excluding others. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
