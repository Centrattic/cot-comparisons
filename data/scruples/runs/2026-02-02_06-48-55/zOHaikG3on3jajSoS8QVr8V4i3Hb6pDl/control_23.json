So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby. They mention that even if the smokers washed their hands, they still don't want the baby to be around secondhand smoke. The smokers live near the baby's bouncer and smoke near the front door. The author avoids their houses to keep the baby away from this. Others are calling them a \"bitch\" because the smokers wash their hands and shower daily. But the author's concern is about the smell and potential secondhand smoke exposure. \n\nI know that secondhand smoke is really harmful for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend avoiding secondhand smoke around babies because it can cause respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome, and other problems. So from a health standpoint, the author is right to be cautious. The smokers might not realize the risks, or maybe they don't take the author's concerns seriously. Also, the smell of smoke can linger on clothes and skin, which is why the author is worried about that transferring to the baby's clothing. \n\nThen there's the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine issue. The author requires people to have the updated vaccine before being near the baby. Whooping cough is extremely dangerous for infants, especially under six months, as they can't get the vaccine yet. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults who will be in contact with newborns to prevent transmission. However, some people might not have had the updated vaccine, possibly because they think the older ones are sufficient or aren't aware of the current guidelines. \n\nThe author is actively avoiding interactions with those who don't meet these criteria. But others are criticizing them. From a medical perspective, these are valid precautions. However, socially, some might see it as being overly strict or excluding people without fully understanding the health risks. The key here is balancing personal health concerns with social relationships. \n\nThe author's reasons are based on protecting the baby's health, which is a parent's primary responsibility. While it's understandable that others might feel hurt or offended, the parent has the right to set boundaries to ensure their child's safety. The criticism from others is likely due to not recognizing the severity of the health risks involved. \n\nSo, considering both the health advice and the social dynamics, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are protective measures for a vulnerable infant. The answer should be B.\n"
