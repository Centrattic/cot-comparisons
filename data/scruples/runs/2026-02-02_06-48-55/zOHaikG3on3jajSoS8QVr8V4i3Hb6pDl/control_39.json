So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are that some people smoke and others haven't updated their Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Smoking is definitely harmful. Secondhand smoke is dangerous for infants, increasing the risk of respiratory issues, SIDS, and other problems. Even if a smoker washes their hands or showers, the residue from smoke can still linger on their clothing and skin, which the baby could be exposed to. So, the author's concern here is valid from a health perspective.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious illness, especially for young infants. The immunity from the vaccine does wear off over time, so getting the updated vaccine is important to protect the baby. People who haven't had the updated vaccine might not be aware of how contagious and dangerous it is for a newborn. The author is trying to protect their child from a preventable disease, which is a responsible decision.\n\nNow, the people involved are upset, calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is not a constructive reaction. The author is standing up for their child's health, which is a parent's right. They are setting boundaries to ensure their child's safety. While it's true that the author might be excluding people, their primary responsibility is to their own child's well-being. The other people's lack of understanding or hygiene isn't the author's fault. They have the right to make decisions based on their child's best interests"
