So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people near their two-month-old daughter. The author has two main reasons: not allowing smokers because they don't want the baby to smell smoke or be exposed to secondhand smoke, and not allowing people who haven't had the updated whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is definitely a serious issue. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend that infants should avoid exposure to tobacco smoke because it can cause respiratory issues, SIDS, and other health problems. So from a medical standpoint, the author is right to be cautious. \n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Pertussis is a dangerous illness for infants, especially those under six months. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to get, especially those who will be in contact with babies. If the people in question haven't had the updated vaccine, they could be a risk. The author is taking a precaution to protect their child, which is reasonable.\n\nThe author mentions that the people in question are smokers and lack hygiene, but they do wash their hands and shower daily. However, as the author points out, the smell of smoke lingers and secondhand smoke can be harmful even if hands are clean. The people are calling the author a bitch for setting these boundaries, but the author is prioritizing their child's health. \n\nI don't see any wrongdoing here. The author is making decisions based on medical advice to protect their baby. People who smoke might find it inconvenient, but they shouldn't take offense when someone is trying to keep their child safe. The author isn't being unkind; they're setting clear boundaries for health reasons. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
