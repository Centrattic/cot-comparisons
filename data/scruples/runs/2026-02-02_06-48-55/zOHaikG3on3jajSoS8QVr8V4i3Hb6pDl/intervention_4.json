So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to think through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting smokers or people without the updated whooping cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They mention that smokers smoke a pack a day and that even if they wash their hands, they still smell like smoke. The author is concerned about their child being exposed to secondhand smoke and the smell lingering on their clothes or the child. That seems like a valid health concern. Secondhand smoke is known to be harmful, especially to infants, so avoiding exposure makes sense.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. The author doesn't allow people who haven't had the updated vaccine near the baby. Whooping cough can be very dangerous for infants, sometimes even fatal. The updated vaccine is recommended because immunity can wane over time. So refusing contact with people who haven't had the update is another health precaution. \n\nThe other people involved are upset, calling the author a \"bitch\" and arguing that they wash their hands and shower daily. But the author's concerns aren't about their hygiene in terms of cleanliness, but specifically about exposure to smoke and lack of vaccination. The other people's arguments about hygiene don't address the actual risks the author is concerned about. \n\nThe author is taking steps to protect their child's health, which is a parent's right. The friends or family members might feel excluded or offended, but the author's primary responsibility is to their child's well-being. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting these boundaries.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while it's true that setting such boundaries can cause conflict, it's generally accepted that protecting a child's health is a priority. The other people might not like it, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author is making reasonable decisions based on medical advice (vaccines) and health risks (secondhand smoke). \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting in their child's best interest, even if others don't agree with their choices. The answer should be B.\n"
