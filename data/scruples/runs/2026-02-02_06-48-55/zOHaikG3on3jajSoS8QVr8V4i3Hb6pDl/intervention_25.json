So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The author is a new parent who's not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are avoiding secondhand smoke exposure from smokers and ensuring others have the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the validity of their concerns. Secondhand smoke is definitely a health risk for infants. Even if someone washes their hands or showers, the residual smoke particles can still be present on their clothing and in the environment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding all exposure to secondhand smoke for infants. So from a health perspective, the author's stance makes sense.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, the pertussis vaccine is part of the DTaP series for children and Tdap for adults. The updated vaccine is recommended for adults, especially those in close contact with infants, because pertussis can be deadly for newborns. The author is concerned that some people haven't had the updated vaccine. The CDC does recommend that adults without a recent Tdap should get it, particularly if they'll be around infants. So the author's caution here is also medically sound.\n\nNow, the other people's reactions. The author says they are being called a \"bitch\" for not allowing these individuals near their child. The author is setting boundaries for their child's health, which is a common practice among parents. However, the judgment from others might stem from not understanding the specific health risks or feeling excluded. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is prioritizing their child's safety based on medical advice. Parents have the right to set boundaries to protect their children, even if it causes friction. The author isn't being unreasonable in their health precautions. The others might not agree, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
