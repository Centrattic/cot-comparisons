So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a new parent with a two-month-old daughter. They've established some rules about who can hold their baby. The main points are:\n\n1. They don't want smokers to hold their baby, even if they've washed their hands. The reasoning is that they don't want the baby to smell smoke, which could transfer to her clothes or expose her to secondhand smoke. The smokers in question are near the front door where the baby's bouncer is located.\n\n2. They also require that anyone holding the baby has the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Some people don't have the updated vaccine, arguing it's not necessary, but the author won't let them near the child.\n\nThe author is getting pushback from others who call them a \"bitch,\" suggesting their rules are too strict. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the smoking issue. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, especially for infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on their skin, hair, and clothes. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against any exposure to secondhand smoke for infants because it can lead to respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other health problems. So from a health perspective, the author's stance makes sense. The smokers might not realize the risks, or maybe they do but dismiss them. But the author's priority is their baby's health, which is a valid concern.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, whooping cough (pertussis) is particularly dangerous for infants. The CDC recommends that anyone in close contact with a newborn get a Tdap vaccine, which covers pertussis. Even if someone had the vaccine in the past, the protection can wane over time, so boosters are advised every 10 years. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccine, they could be at risk of carrying the disease, even if asymptomatic. The author is taking a proactive step to protect their baby, which is understandable.\n\nNow, the pushback from family and friends. They're called a \"bitch,\" which is a harsh reaction. The author is trying to set boundaries for their child's safety, but others might feel excluded or think the rules are too strict. However, the author's reasons are based on health concerns, not personal dislike. It's reasonable for parents to have such rules, especially when public health guidelines support them.\n\nThe smokers might argue that washing hands and showering is enough, but that doesn't eliminate the risk of secondhand or thirdhand smoke. The author's request to not be in the house is a logical extension of their safety measures. If someone smokes near the door where the baby's bouncer is, that's direct secondhand smoke exposure, which is harmful. The author is acting to prevent that.\n\nIn terms of the vaccine, the author is following medical advice. The people not updating their vaccination might not be aware of the recommendations, or they might be in denial about the risk. The author's stance is to protect their baby, which is a parent's right.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making health-based decisions to protect their infant, which is their responsibility. The criticism from others seems to stem from misunderstanding or not taking the risks seriously. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
