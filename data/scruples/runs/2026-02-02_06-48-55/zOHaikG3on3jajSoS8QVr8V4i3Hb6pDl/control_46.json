So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points here are the author's reasons: avoiding smokers due to secondhand smoke and the risk of nicotine residue, and not allowing those without the updated whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if these reasons are valid. For the smoking issue, secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, especially for infants. Even if someone washes their hands or showers, there's still the risk of thirdhand smoke residue on their skin or clothes. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend keeping infants away from secondhand smoke. So the author's concern is medically supported.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Pertussis (whooping cough) can be severe in infants, and while the vaccine's effectiveness may wane over time, getting an updated booster is a common precaution. The author's stance here is about protecting their child from a preventable illness. The people in question might believe the vaccine isn't necessary, but the author's choice is based on medical advice.\n\nThe author is also facing criticism from others, being called a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries. That's a red flag. People's health and their child's safety shouldn't be a matter of social judgment. The author has the right to set boundaries to protect their child, even if it causes discomfort. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the health reasons are valid, the author is taking reasonable precautions, and others' reactions are dismissive of those valid concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
