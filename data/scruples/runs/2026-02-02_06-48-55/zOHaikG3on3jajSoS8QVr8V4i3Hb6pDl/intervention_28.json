So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are the author's concerns about smokers and lack of updated whooping cough vaccines.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful. The CDC and other health organizations warn about the dangers of secondhand smoke for infants, including increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and more. So the author's concern about not wanting smokers near the baby is valid from a health perspective. The fact that the smokers wash their hands and shower might reduce some immediate risks, but the smoke particles can linger on clothing and in the environment, which the author is trying to avoid.\n\nRegarding the whooping cough vaccine, pertussis is a serious illness for infants, especially those under six months. The whooping cough vaccine's protection wanes over time, so boosters are recommended. If the author is concerned about their unvaccinated or unboostered friends being around the baby, that's also a legitimate precaution. The friends not getting the vaccine could be a risk, even if they believe it's unnecessary. The author has the right to prioritize their child's safety, even if others disagree.\n\nNow, the author is facing criticism for being a \"bitch,\" which is a judgment of their character rather than the concerns themselves. It's important to distinguish between the author's actions and the opinions of others. The author's actions are based on health and safety, not malice. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is actively avoiding these people, which might be seen as excluding them. However, the parent's primary responsibility is to protect the child. The friends' hygiene and vaccination choices are within their rights, but the parent's choice to protect the baby is also valid. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. They are making decisions based on the best interests of their child's health. The friends' reactions are more about personal feelings rather than valid health concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
