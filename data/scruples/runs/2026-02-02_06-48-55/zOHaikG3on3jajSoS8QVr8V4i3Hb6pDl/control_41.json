So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The two main reasons given are not allowing smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health risks involved. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, especially for infants who are more vulnerable. Even if smokers wash their hands or shower, the residue from smoke can linger on their skin, hair, and clothes. This can expose the baby to harmful chemicals. The American Academy of Pediatrics does advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke, so the author's stance on this seems valid.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine, the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect against pertussis, which can be severe in infants. The CDC advises that unvaccinated individuals, especially those in close contact with babies, should avoid contact until they are up-to-date. Whooping Cough can be deadly for newborns, so the author's precaution here is also justified.\n\nThe author is being criticized for being a \"bitch,\" but their reasons are based on health and safety. It's their right to protect their child from preventable risks. The people being excluded are the ones who have chosen to smoke or not get vaccinated. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're making a decision based on medical advice to protect their vulnerable infant.\n\nSo, considering public health guidelines and the author's intent to protect their child, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
