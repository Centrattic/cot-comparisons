So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The post is about the author not wanting smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They don't want smokers around the baby because of secondhand smoke. The smokers argue they wash their hands and shower, but the author is concerned about the smell and potential health risks. Then there's the whooping cough vaccine issue. The author is strict about that because whooping cough is dangerous for infants. The people in question don't have the updated vaccine, thinking it's unnecessary.\n\nI should think about common practices and medical advice. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants, increasing risks of SIDS and respiratory issues. Even if smokers clean their hands, the smell and chemicals can linger on their clothes and skin. So the author's stance on that might be reasonable. \n\nRegarding the vaccine, whooping cough (pertussis) is highly contagious and dangerous for young babies. The Tdap vaccine is recommended during pregnancy or for those in close contact with infants. Some people might not realize the importance of getting the updated vaccine, but the author's precaution makes sense to protect the baby.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding people who smoke or aren't vaccinated. The question is whether this is justified. From a health perspective, both concerns are valid. However, the author might come across as strict or unwelcoming, leading to social friction. But the health and safety of the baby should be the priority.\n\nThe original answer thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe that's because people might feel it's too harsh. But considering the baby's well-being, the author's decisions are protective. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). Need to check if there's any aspect I'm missing, like if the author's rules are based on misinformation, but the reasoning given seems medically sound. So the answer is B.\n"
