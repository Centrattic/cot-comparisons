So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The two main reasons given are not allowing smokers and those without the updated whooping cough vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Newborns and infants have underdeveloped immune systems, making them more vulnerable to illnesses. Secondhand smoke exposure can lead to serious health issues like respiratory infections, SIDS, and asthma. The CDC and other health organizations do recommend keeping infants away from secondhand smoke, so the author's stance on this seems justified.\n\nRegarding the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine, the Tdap booster is especially recommended for those who will be around infants. Whooping cough can be life-threatening for babies, and even if someone is vaccinated, the protection wanes over time. The updated vaccine ensures they're protected, which in turn protects the baby. The author is being cautious here, which is logical.\n\nHowever, the author is facing criticism from others labeled as \"bitches,\" which is unfair. The people not following these health precautions might not understand the severity, but that doesn't make the author wrong. They have the right to set boundaries to protect their child's health. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is being overly strict? But considering the risks involved, it's reasonable. Parents often set strict rules to ensure their child's safety, and this is a new baby, so the stress and anxiety are understandable. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their child's health based on medical advice. The people who are upset might be defensive, but the author's actions are protective. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
