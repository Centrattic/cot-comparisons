So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are avoiding smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they don't want smokers to hold their baby. The reasoning is about secondhand smoke exposure and the smell. The author points out that even if the smokers wash their hands, they still smoke a pack a day near the front door where the baby's bouncer is. The other people argue that the author is being a \"bitch\" because they wash their hands and shower daily. The author, in turn, avoids going to their houses or letting them into theirs.\n\nThen there's the issue with the Whooping Cough vaccine. The author requires the updated version, but some people don't have it, claiming it's not necessary. The author is strict about this.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. From the author's perspective, protecting a newborn is a top priority. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants, and the vaccine is recommended for close contacts. Even if the people are otherwise healthy, not having the updated vaccine leaves the baby vulnerable. So, that part is medically supported. As for the smokers, secondhand smoke is known to be harmful to infants, increasing the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and asthma. The smell lingering in clothes and the environment is also a valid concern. The smokers washing hands doesn't mitigate the risk of secondhand smoke exposure when they're near the baby.\n\nOn the other side, the people the author is excluding might feel that the author is being overly strict or judgmental. They might argue that washing hands and showering should be sufficient, especially if they don't see the direct risk from secondhand smoke. However, their lack of hygiene is mentioned as a separate issue, which complicates things. The author might have valid reasons beyond just the smoke, but the main argument is about the smoke and vaccine status.\n\nSo, the author's actions are based on health and safety concerns for their child. The exclusion of smokers is medically justified, and the vaccine requirement is also a standard precaution for infants. The other people's reactions might stem from not fully understanding the risks or feeling personally attacked. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their baby's well-being. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
