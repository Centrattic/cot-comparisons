So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again. The person had a baby two months ago and is setting boundaries about who can hold their daughter. They don't want smokers to hold her, even if they've washed their hands, because of secondhand smoke concerns. Also, they don't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is a real issue, especially for infants, as it can cause respiratory problems and other health issues. The person is concerned about the smell and potential exposure, which is valid. Even if the people have washed their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and in the environment, right? So their reasoning for not allowing smokers to hold the baby seems logical and protective.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough is a serious infection, especially for young infants who can't be vaccinated yet. The person is requiring the updated vaccine to prevent the spread. The others are saying it's not necessary, but the author is doing what's best for their child. It's their right to set those boundaries for their baby's safety.\n\nBut then, others are calling the author a \"bitch\" for these decisions. That's a bit harsh. The author is trying to protect their child, which is a natural parental instinct. It's not about being difficult; it's about health and safety. The people who are upset might not realize the risks involved. The author is not being inconsiderate; they're being cautious. \n\nHowever, I should also think about the social aspect. Maybe the author is cutting off friends or family, which could create tension. But in this case, the author is avoiding their houses and not inviting them over, which might be a middle ground. They're not necessarily cutting off completely but are making their boundaries clear.\n\nIn terms of legal or social wrong, I don't see the author doing anything unethical or harmful. They have the right to protect their child from potential health hazards. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are making responsible decisions for their baby's well-being."
