So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has specific reasons: they don't want their child exposed to secondhand smoke or the risk of pertussis (whooping cough). They mentioned that even if smokers wash their hands, the smell lingers and they smoke near the baby's bouncer. Also, the whooping cough vaccine is important because the disease is serious for infants.\n\nThen there's the other side: people are telling the author they're being a \"bitch\" because the smokers are clean, and the unvaccinated people believe they don't need the updated vaccine. The author actively avoids these people.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. From a health perspective, protecting an infant from secondhand smoke is supported by medical guidelines. Secondhand smoke is harmful and increases the risk of SIDS and respiratory issues. Pertussis is also a significant risk for infants under six months, who can't get vaccinated yet. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults around babies to prevent transmission.\n\nHowever, social dynamics might be at play. The author is setting boundaries, which is their right, but the reactions from others (\"bitch\") suggest they might not understand the health rationale. The author's approach could be seen as necessary for the baby's well-being, but it's possible that communication could be improved to explain the medical reasons rather than just stating rules.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their child's health based on valid medical concerns. The other people's reactions might stem from not recognizing the severity of these health risks. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
