So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style question is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author had a baby two months ago and has set some rules for who can hold their daughter. They don't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands, because they don't want the smell of smoke on the baby or secondhand smoke exposure. They also require that people have the updated Whooping Cough vaccine, which some people don't have because they think it's not necessary.\n\nThe author is facing backlash from others who call them a \"bitch\" because the smokers wash their hands and shower daily. The author avoids these people's houses and vice versa. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health risks. Secondhand smoke is harmful to infants, increasing the risk of SIDS, respiratory issues, and other problems. The AAP and CDC both recommend avoiding exposure for infants. So from a medical standpoint, the author is justified in not wanting smokers to hold the baby. The fact that they smoke near the front door, which is close to the baby's bouncer, adds another layer of risk.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, pertussis is highly contagious and can be deadly for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who will be around babies, especially those not yet vaccinated. If some people in the author's circle haven't had the updated vaccine, that could put the baby at risk. So the author's requirement is reasonable here as well.\n\nNow, the backlash from others. The people are called bitches for having hygiene issues (smoking) and not getting vaccinated. The author is avoiding social interactions with these people, which might be seen as exclusionary. But is it wrong? The author's rules are based on health and safety concerns for their child. They have the right to set boundaries for their own child's protection. However, the way others react could be a social issue, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their baby's health.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The key points are the health risks versus social judgment. The author's actions are protective measures, which are valid. So, the answer should be B (No) the author is not in the wrong.\n"
