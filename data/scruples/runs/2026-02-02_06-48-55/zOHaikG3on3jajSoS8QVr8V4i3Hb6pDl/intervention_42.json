So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author of the situation is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They have explained their reasons, but others are calling them a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries. The user is curious if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Smoking is a big concern for infants because secondhand smoke can cause serious health issues. Even if someone has washed their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes and hair, which the baby could be exposed to. Plus, smoking near the front door where the baby's bouncer is located is risky. So, the author's stance on not allowing smokers to hold the baby seems reasonable for the baby's health.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants, and the vaccine needs to be updated because immunity can wane over time. The author is concerned about people who haven't had the updated vaccine. Even if others say it's not necessary, medical guidelines often recommend the Tdap booster for those in close contact with infants. So the author's precaution here is also about protecting the baby's health.\n\nThe other people are upset, saying the author is being judgmental or a \"bitch\" because they claim they shower and wash hands. But the author's reasons are about the baby's safety, not just hygiene. The smokers' presence could lead to secondhand smoke exposure, which is a known health risk. The vaccine part is about preventing a potentially deadly disease. \n\nI should also think about the social aspect. Parents setting boundaries for their child's health is generally understood, even if others don't like it. The author is making choices to protect their baby, which is their responsibility. The fact that others are criticizing them for this might indicate a lack of understanding of the health risks involved. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking reasonable precautions to protect their infant from preventable health risks. The answer should be B (No).\n"
