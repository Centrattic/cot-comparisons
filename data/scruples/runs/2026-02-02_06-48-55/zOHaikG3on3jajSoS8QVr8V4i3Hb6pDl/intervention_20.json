So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author explains their reasons: not wanting secondhand smoke exposure and protecting against diseases like whooping cough. However, others are calling them a \"bitch\" for these restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's reasons. Smoking around a baby is a known health risk. Secondhand smoke can lead to respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other problems. Even if smokers wash their hands, the residual smoke particles in their clothes and hair can still affect the baby. So the author's stance on not allowing smokers is generally supported by health guidelines. \n\nAs for the whooping cough vaccine, whooping cough (pertussis) is extremely dangerous for infants, especially under six months old. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect against it, as infants haven't completed their vaccine series. If people close to the baby haven't updated their vaccines, they pose a risk. The author's concern here is also medically valid.\n\nHowever, the author is facing backlash from others, who argue that washing and showering should be enough for smokers and that the vaccine isn't necessary. The author is actively avoiding these people from being in their home. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for these decisions.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is making personal health choices for their child, which is a parent's right. On the other hand, some might argue that being too strict could lead to social isolation or judgment. But given the medical evidence supporting the risks of secondhand smoke and whooping cough, the author's precautions seem reasonable. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are justified by health and safety concerns. Since protecting a newborn from preventable health risks is a priority, the author is likely not in the wrong. The backlash from others might stem from misunderstanding or not valuing the infant's safety enough. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
