So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Smoking around infants can be dangerous because of secondhand smoke, which is a known risk for respiratory issues and other health problems. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their skin and clothes, which might be harmful if the baby is in close contact. Also, the author mentions that the smokers do it near the front door and the baby's bouncer, which could expose the baby to the smoke directly. So that's a valid concern.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is a serious illness for newborns, and the vaccine is crucial for preventing it. The author is concerned about people not having the updated vaccine. If those people haven't been vaccinated, they could potentially spread the disease, which is life-threatening for a young baby. The others argue that the vaccine doesn't need to be updated, but as far as I know, the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to update their protection, especially if they're in contact with infants. So the author's stance here is also about protecting the baby from a preventable but serious condition.\n\nNow, the other people are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is unkind. But the author's reasons are based on legitimate health concerns. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting these boundaries. \n\nOn one hand, the author is protecting their child's health, which is a parent's right. On the other, the friends might feel excluded or judged, but that doesn't override the need to protect a vulnerable infant. The author isn't being hostile; they're setting clear boundaries. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to prioritize their child's safety even if others don't agree with the reasons.\n"
