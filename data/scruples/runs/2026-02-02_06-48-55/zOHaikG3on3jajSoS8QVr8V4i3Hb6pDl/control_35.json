So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong regarding not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The key points are the author's refusal to let smokers hold their baby and people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Secondhand smoke is harmful, especially for infants, as it can cause respiratory issues and other health problems. The American Academy of Pediatrics does advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. So the author's stance on smokers is likely based on valid health concerns. Even if the smokers have washed their hands or showered, the smoke near the front door where the baby's bouncer is could still pose a risk. The smell and potential toxins in the environment matter.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine. The updated vaccine is important because immunity from the vaccine wanes over time, and whooping cough can be dangerous for infants. The CDC recommends that adults, especially those in close contact with infants, get the Tdap vaccine. If some people haven't updated their vaccine, they might be at higher risk of carrying the disease, even if they were vaccinated in the past. The author's concern here is about protecting the baby from a potentially life-threatening illness.\n\nThe author is avoiding letting these people into their home, which is their right. They're making decisions based on their child's health. The criticism from others calling them a \"bitch\" seems unfair, as it's about protecting the baby. However, the smokers might argue that they're taking hygiene steps, but those steps don't eliminate the risk of secondhand smoke exposure. Similarly, the vaccine issue is about preventing a serious disease.\n\nI need to check if there's any cultural or social norm that might influence this. In some cases, people might feel excluded or insulted if not allowed to hold a baby, but health and safety should take precedence. The author isn't being hostile, just setting boundaries for their child's protection. The response from others seems more about their feelings rather than the baby's well-being.\n\nSo, combining these points: the author's decisions are based on valid health precautions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
