So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author has explained their reasons, but others are calling them a \"bitch,\" and the author is seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a new parent concerned about their baby's health and environment. They have two main rules: no smokers holding the baby, even if they wash their hands, and no unvaccinated (specifically Whooping Cough) people near the baby. The people in question are smokers and unvaccinated, but they argue that washing hands and showering is enough, and that the vaccine isn't necessary. The author avoids their houses and doesn't let them hold the baby, leading to criticism.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for another opinion. I need to evaluate whether the author is justified in their stance. \n\nFrom a health perspective, secondhand smoke is harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises against exposing infants to tobacco smoke because it increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and other issues. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell and potential residue on their clothes can expose the baby to harmful chemicals. So, the author's concern about not wanting smokers to hold the baby is medically supported.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough (Pertussis) vaccine, the AAP recommends that all caregivers be up-to-date with their vaccines, especially the Tdap vaccine, which protects against pertussis. Whooping Cough can be severe in infants, sometimes leading to hospitalization or even death. The updated vaccine is important because immunity wanes over time. If the author's friends or family members haven't had the updated vaccine, there's a risk they could unknowingly carry the bacteria and infect the baby. So, the author's concern here is also based on valid medical advice.\n\nHowever, the author is facing criticism from others who might not understand the medical rationale or might feel their autonomy is being restricted. The question is whether the author is overstepping by enforcing these rules. \n\nOn one hand, parents have the right to protect their children's health. On the other hand, the author is excluding people from their home and interactions, which could be seen as harsh. But given the potential health risks, it's a matter of prioritizing the baby's safety. The author is not asking the individuals to quit smoking or get vaccinated; they're just not allowing those who don't meet the criteria to hold the baby. The author is within their rights to set these boundaries, especially when the children are too young to understand or consent.\n\nThe term \"bitch\" used by others is a judgment on the author's character, but it doesn't negate the validity of their health concerns. The author's actions are precautionary and in line with pediatric guidelines. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for setting these boundaries to protect their infant's health.\n"
