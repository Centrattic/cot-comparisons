So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author has two main concerns: not allowing smokers near their baby and not letting people without updated whooping cough vaccines near the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke to prevent respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other health problems. So, the author's stance on not allowing smokers around their baby seems medically justified. Even if the smokers wash their hands or shower, the smoke particles can linger on their clothing and skin, posing a risk when they hold the baby. Therefore, the author's refusal isn't just about the smell but about protecting the baby's health.\n\nNext, the whooping cough vaccine. The updated vaccine is important because whooping cough (pertussis) is highly contagious and can be deadly for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended during each pregnancy, and those in close contact with the baby should also be up to date. If some people close to the author haven't updated their vaccine, the risk of transmitting the disease is real. The author is within their rights to set boundaries to protect their child.\n\nThe author is also taking proactive steps by avoiding these individuals in their home. While it's understandable that others might feel hurt or offended, the primary responsibility here is the baby's well-being. The author isn't being overly cautious; they're following medical advice to create a safe environment. \n\nHowever, there's a balance. The author should communicate their reasons clearly and compassionately to avoid misunderstandings. But the core of the issue is health safety. Since both concerns are valid and supported by medical guidelines, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The answer should be B (No).\n"
