So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again. The author had a baby two months ago and has some rules about who can hold her. They don't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands, because of secondhand smoke near the bouncer and the smell. Also, they don't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nThe author is being called a \"bitch\" by others for these rules. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the opinion here. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's look at the smoking issue. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke. Smokers might have residual nicotine on their hands or clothes, and the smell could transfer. Even if they wash their hands, the smell from their clothes or the act of smoking near the baby's area is a valid health concern. Secondhand smoke is harmful to infants, so refusing smokers is a reasonable precaution. The other people's argument that washing hands is enough might not address the actual risk here.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough vaccine. The author requires the updated vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious illness for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect newborns. If the people they know haven't updated their vaccine, they might not be immune, posing a risk. The others argue it's not necessary, but medical guidelines often recommend it for anyone around babies. The author's stance is protective and aligns with health advice.\n\nThe other people are dismissing the author's concerns and calling them names. The author is setting boundaries for their child's safety. It's their right to decide who interacts with their baby. The judgment from others doesn't make the author wrong; it's about their child's health.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author is protecting their child from known health risks. The actions taken are reasonable and responsible. The other people's reactions are about not understanding or respecting those boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
