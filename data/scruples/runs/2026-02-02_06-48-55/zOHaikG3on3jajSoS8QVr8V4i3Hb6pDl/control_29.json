So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people around their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby. They mention that even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell could linger on the baby or her clothes. Also, the smokers are near the baby's bouncer outside. The author is actively avoiding these people. Others are calling them a bitch for this.\n\nThen there's the part about the Whooping Cough vaccine. The author requires the updated version, but some people haven't gotten it, claiming it's unnecessary. The author is excluding them too.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFor the smoking issue: Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell can transfer, and there's also the risk of nicotine residue. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. So from a health and safety standpoint, the author has valid concerns. The fact that the smokers are near the baby's bouncer adds to that risk. So the author's stance here seems justified.\n\nRegarding the vaccines: Whooping Cough (pertussis) is serious for infants. The AAP recommends that all caregivers be up to date with vaccinations, including the Tdap booster. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, they might not be protected, increasing the risk to the baby. So the author's requirement for the vaccine is also based on sound medical advice.\n\nThe author is being accused of being a \"bitch\" by others. But personal boundaries, especially when it comes to a child's health, are important. It's reasonable to set these limits, especially when there are clear health risks involved. The author isn't being mean for no reason; they're acting in their child's best interest. The people they're excluding are the ones potentially endangering the baby, not the author.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Their actions are based on protecting their child's health, which is a valid and responsible decision.\n"
