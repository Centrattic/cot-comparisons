So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. The key points here are the author's reasons and how others are responding.\n\nFirst, the author's concern about smokers is about secondhand smoke and the smell. They mention that people argue they've washed their hands and showered, but the author still refuses. Second, the Whooping Cough vaccine part is about not allowing people who haven't had the updated vaccine near the baby, which some others dismiss as unnecessary.\n\nI need to evaluate if these boundaries are reasonable. For the smoking issue: secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, even if someone showers or washes hands, the smoke in the environment can still affect the baby. The CDC and other health organizations recommend no smoking around infants. So the author's stance here seems medically sound. The people's response that they're a \"bitch\" might be because they don't understand the health risks, but the author has a valid concern.\n\nFor the vaccination part: Whooping Cough (pertussis) is very dangerous for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in contact with babies. If the author's friends haven't had the updated vaccine, the author is protecting the baby from a preventable disease. Again, public health guidelines support this precaution.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. The other people's reactions seem dismissive and possibly not informed about the actual risks. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have valid health reasons. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
