So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author had a baby two months ago and has just given her first round of vaccines. They\u2019ve told people that smokers shouldn't hold their daughter, even if they wash their hands. The reason is the smell of smoke on the smokers, the risk of secondhand smoke near her bouncer, and concerns about their hygiene. The author also doesn't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby. Some people are upset, saying the author is being unreasonable. The author is avoiding these people's houses.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's think about the smoking part. Secondhand smoke is definitely a health risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations advise against exposing babies to secondhand smoke because it can cause respiratory issues, SIDS, and other problems. Even if smokers wash their hands, the smell can linger on their skin and clothes. Also, if they smoke near the baby's bouncer, that's dangerous. So from a health perspective, the author has valid reasons. But maybe some people see it as being too strict or not trusting others, hence the \"bitch\" comment.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants, especially since their immune systems are not fully developed. The updated vaccine is important because immunity wanes over time. Ensuring that people around the baby are up-to-date with vaccines is a common precaution. Those who haven't updated their vaccines might not realize the importance, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the author is prioritizing their child's health, which is understandable. However, the people involved might feel judged or excluded. The author's actions could be seen as necessary for the baby's safety, but the author is actively avoiding these people, which might affect relationships. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a health standpoint, their decisions are based on medical advice. But if they are being confrontational or not communicating effectively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, the author is just setting boundaries based on health concerns, which are valid. The other people's reactions might stem from not fully understanding the risks. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's position seems justified. They are protecting their child, which is a parent's responsibility. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
