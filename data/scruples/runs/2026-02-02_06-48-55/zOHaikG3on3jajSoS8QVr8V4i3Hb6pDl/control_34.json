So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter because those people smoke and haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke exposure and the risk of pertussis (whooping cough), which can be severe for infants. The CDC and other health organizations do advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and other issues. So, the author's concern about smokers is valid from a health perspective.\n\nRegarding the pertussis vaccine, the acellular pertussis vaccine's effectiveness can wane over time. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in contact with infants. Whooping cough can be deadly for newborns, so ensuring that people around them are vaccinated is a precaution. The people in question might not realize the importance of the updated vaccine, but the author is acting to protect their child.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding these people by not inviting them over or visiting them. The question is whether this is justifiable. Since the author is making a judgment based on health risks, and the other people's actions (smoking, not getting the vaccine) could pose real dangers, the author isn't necessarily being unreasonable. They have the right to set boundaries to protect their child. The people calling the author names might be defensive, but the author's actions are protective measures.\n\nHowever, there's a line between protection and exclusion. The author is making a choice based on their values and medical advice. It's not about being a \"bitch\" but about health safety. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
