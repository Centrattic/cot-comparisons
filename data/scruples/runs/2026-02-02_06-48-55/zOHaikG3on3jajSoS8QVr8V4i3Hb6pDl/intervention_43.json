So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a two-month-old daughter and has specific rules about who can hold her. The main points are:\n\n1. They don't want smokers to hold their daughter, even if they've washed their hands, because of the secondhand smoke smell and possible lingering on the child's clothes. Also, the smokers are near her bouncer and the front door, which is a concern.\n2. They also don't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby.\n\nThe author is facing backlash from others who call them a \"bitch\" and argue that the smokers have good hygiene (showering daily, washed hands). The author is avoiding these people in their home or visiting theirs.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the reasons:\n\n- **Smoking and Secondhand Smoke**: Even if smokers wash hands, they might carry the smell on their clothes and body, which the author is concerned about. Secondhand smoke is harmful to infants, so avoiding such exposure is medically advisable. The smokers' argument about hygiene doesn't address the actual risk of secondhand smoke, which is a valid health concern.\n\n- **Whooping Cough Vaccination**: Whooping Cough (Pertussis) is a serious disease for infants. The updated vaccine is recommended because immunity can wane over time. Not having the updated vaccine increases the risk of transmitting the disease to a vulnerable baby. The people in question might not be aware of the necessity of the updated vaccine, but the author's stance here is based on protecting their child's health.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. The people they're excluding are making personal choices (smoking, not getting the updated vaccine) that could pose risks to the baby. The author isn't being inconsiderate without reason; they have health-based justifications.\n\nHowever, the user's initial thought was the author is in the wrong. Maybe they consider it being too strict or not respecting others' habits. But from a health and safety perspective, especially for infants, these precautions are reasonable.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are justified by health risks. Since there's a medical basis for avoiding secondhand smoke and ensuring up-to-date Pertussis vaccination, the author is acting in the best interest of their child. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
