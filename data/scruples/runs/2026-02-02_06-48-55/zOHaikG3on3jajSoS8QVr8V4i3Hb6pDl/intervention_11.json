So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not allowing smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the author has clear reasons: they don't want their baby exposed to secondhand smoke or the risk of whooping cough. They mention that the people in question smoke a pack a day, even if they wash their hands or shower. The author avoids these people to protect their child.\n\nNow, the other people are calling the author a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries. But is the author in the wrong? Well, as a parent, they have the right to make decisions they believe are best for their child's health. Secondhand smoke is dangerous for infants\u2014CDC and other health organizations warn against it. Whooping cough is also a serious threat, especially to young babies who can't get vaccinated yet. \n\nThe people who smoke or aren't vaccinated might think the author is being too strict, but the author's actions are about health and safety. They're not excluding people out of prejudice but to protect their child from preventable risks. \n\nSo, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their baby's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility.\n"
