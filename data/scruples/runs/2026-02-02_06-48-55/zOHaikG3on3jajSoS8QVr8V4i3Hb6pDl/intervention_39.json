So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are that some people smoke and others haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Smoking around infants is a known risk. Secondhand smoke can lead to serious health issues for babies, like respiratory problems, SIDS, etc. Even if someone washes their hands or showers, the smoke residue on their clothes (thirdhand smoke) can still be harmful. So, the author's concern about not wanting smokers to hold her baby seems valid. It's a protective measure to keep the baby safe. \n\nThen there's theWhooping Cough vaccine. Adults who haven't had the updated vaccine could potentially pass the disease to the baby. Whooping Cough can be deadly for infants. The author's requirement for the updated vaccine is a precaution to prevent that. The people in question might think it's unnecessary, but the author is prioritizing her baby's safety.\n\nNow, the other side: the people are upset because they feel they're being judged or excluded. They might feel that the author is being overly cautious or rude. However, the author is setting boundaries to protect her child. It's her choice as a parent to decide who can and cannot be around her baby. \n\nI need to check if there's any cultural or social norms that might influence this. In some cases, people might expect to hold a newborn at gatherings, but the author is making it clear from the start. It's about personal boundaries versus social expectations. \n\nAlso, the term \"bitch\" used by others is problematic. The author isn't being mean; she's stating her non-negotiables. The others might not understand the severity of the health risks, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's taking reasonable precautions for her baby's health. The answer should be B.\n"
