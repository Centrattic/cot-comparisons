So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated whooping cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They mention that others are calling them a \"bitch\" for these restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against any exposure to tobacco smoke for babies because it can cause respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other health problems. So the parent's concern about smokers is valid from a medical standpoint. The smokers washing their hands and showering daily might reduce some contaminants, but the smell of smoke can linger on clothes and skin, which isn't just about hygiene but about actual health risks.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Pertussis (whooping cough) is a serious illness for infants, especially those under six months. The vaccine is recommended for adults, especially those in close contact with babies, because immunity wanes over time. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccines, they could be a risk even if they were vaccinated as children. The CDC does recommend a Tdap booster for adults who haven't had it, particularly for those around infants. So the parent's requirement for the updated vaccine is also medically supported.\n\nThe parent is setting boundaries to protect their child, which is a common and responsible action. The criticism from others about being a \"bitch\" might stem from not understanding the medical reasons or feeling excluded. However, the parent's decisions are based on public health recommendations. They are not being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their child's health.\n\nI should also consider social dynamics. While it's true that not everyone might agree with the parent's strictness, health guidelines support their stance. The smokers might not realize the extent of the risk their habit poses, and the unvaccinated individuals might not be aware of the need for a booster. The parent is acting in their child's best interest, which is their primary responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't in the wrong. Their actions are justified by health authorities, and they have the right to set boundaries to protect their infant. The answer should be B, No.\n"
