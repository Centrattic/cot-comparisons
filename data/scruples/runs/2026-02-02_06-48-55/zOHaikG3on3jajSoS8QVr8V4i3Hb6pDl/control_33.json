So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting smokers and people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points. The author has clear reasons: avoiding secondhand smoke exposure and ensuring proper vaccination to protect the baby. They mentioned that smokers smoke a pack a day, even if they wash hands. The concern about secondhand smoke is valid because it's harmful to infants. Also, Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious risk for newborns, and the updated vaccine is recommended for those in close contact with infants. \n\nThe people in question are arguing that washing hands and showering is enough, but the author points out that the smokers have poor hygiene. The author is avoiding these people's homes to protect the baby. \n\nNow, considering medical advice, secondhand smoke is indeed dangerous for babies. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, advises no smoking around infants. Also, the Tdap vaccine (for Whooping Cough) is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those who will be around babies. So, the author's precautions align with medical guidelines. \n\nThe people calling the author a \"bitch\" might be misunderstanding the health risks. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're taking reasonable steps to protect their child. The fact that the smokers lack hygiene adds another layer of concern. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are based on valid health concerns, and they have the right to set boundaries to protect their baby.\n"
