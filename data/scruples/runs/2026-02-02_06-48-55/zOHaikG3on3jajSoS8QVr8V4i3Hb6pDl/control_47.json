So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are about not allowing smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Smoking is a big concern because secondhand smoke is harmful to infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell might linger on their clothes and skin, which can affect the baby. Also, smoking near the baby's area increases the risk of exposure. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke for infants, so the author's stance here is medically sound.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough, or pertussis, can be severe in infants. The Tdap vaccine is particularly important for caregivers to prevent spreading the disease. The author requires the updated vaccine, which might be a Tdap booster. If some people haven't gotten the updated one, they might not be protected against pertussis, making them a potential risk. The CDC recommends a Tdap booster for adults who haven't had it, so the author's requirement aligns with health guidelines.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. The reactions from others, calling them a \"bitch,\" seem to stem from not understanding the health risks. The author's actions are about preventing harm, which is a parent's responsibility. While it's natural for people to feel hurt or offended if excluded, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's safety. There's no indication that the author is being cruel without cause; they have valid, medically supported reasons.\n\nSo, considering the health guidelines and the parent's right to protect their child, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
