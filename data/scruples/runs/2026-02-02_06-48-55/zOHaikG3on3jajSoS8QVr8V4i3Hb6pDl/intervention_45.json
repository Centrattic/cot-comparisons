So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author has clear reasons: avoiding secondhand smoke and preventing whooping cough. But others are calling them a bitch.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's stance is based on health concerns. Smoking near the baby, even if they wash their hands, could still leave nicotine residues or cause exposure to secondhand smoke, which is harmful. The AAP does recommend keeping smoke-free environments around infants. So, that part seems justified.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who will be around infants because whooping cough can be very dangerous for babies. If some people haven't updated their vaccine, the author has a valid reason to be cautious. The others might argue it's unnecessary, but medical guidelines support the author's precaution.\n\nHowever, the author is excluding people from their home or visits. The tension here is between the parent's right to protect their child and the guests' feelings. The author is firm, and others are upset, calling them names. The question is whether the author is overstepping.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The author's reasons are medically sound. They are making reasonable safety decisions for their baby. The others might not appreciate it, but the parent's priority is the child's health. So the author isn't being unreasonable. The answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
