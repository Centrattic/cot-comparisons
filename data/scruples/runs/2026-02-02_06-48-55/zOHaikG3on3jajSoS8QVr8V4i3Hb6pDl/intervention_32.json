So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a new parent who doesn't want certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are two-fold: one is that some people smoke a lot and the author doesn't want the baby to be exposed to secondhand smoke or the smell, and the other is that some people haven't had the updated whooping cough vaccine, which the author is concerned about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend avoiding any exposure to secondhand smoke for babies because it can lead to respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other problems. Even if the smokers have washed their hands or showered, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and in their hair, which the baby could still be exposed to when they're holding her. So the author's concern here seems valid from a health standpoint.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine. Whooping cough is a serious disease for infants, and the vaccine is recommended for close contacts, especially for those who will be around a newborn. The DTaP vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunizations, and the Tdap booster is recommended for adults, including those who haven't had the pertussis vaccine in the last 10 years. The author is concerned that some people haven't updated their vaccine, which could put the baby at risk. This is also a legitimate medical concern because whooping cough can be life-threatening for young babies.\n\nNow, the author's actions are to avoid having these people in their house or going to theirs. The question is whether this is reasonable or if the author is being unreasonable. The people involved are calling the author a \"bitch,\" implying that they think the author is being too strict or judgmental. But from a health perspective, the author is taking proactive steps to protect their child. It's important to note that parents are responsible for making decisions that protect their child's health, even if it means setting boundaries that others find uncomfortable.\n\nHowever, there might be a nuance in how the author communicates this. If the author hasn't clearly explained the health reasons behind their decisions, others might not understand or respect them. The author mentions that they've explained their reasons, so that's a point in their favor. Still, the people in question are dismissive, saying things like \"you wouldn't know unless they have told you, they lack hygiene,\" which suggests they might not be considering the author's valid concerns.\n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, it's generally accepted that parents have the right to set boundaries to protect their children, especially when it comes to health and safety. So, if the author's actions are based on legitimate health concerns and they're transparent about it, they're not being unreasonable. The people who are upset might be misunderstanding the risks or not taking the author's concerns seriously enough.\n\nAnother angle is the social aspect. Excluding people from one's home or social circle can be seen as harsh, but in this case, it's for the baby's well-being. It's a balance between social relationships and health protection. The author is choosing the latter, which is a responsible choice given the vulnerability of a two-month-old.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions seem justified based on health recommendations and the need to protect their infant. The people who are upset might be misjudging the situation or not recognizing the severity of the health risks involved. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
