So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author's stance on not allowing smokers and unvaccinated people near their two-month-old is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is a serious issue for infants. The CDC and other health organizations do warn about the dangers of secondhand smoke to babies, including increased risk of SIDS, respiratory infections, and other issues. So, the author's concern about not wanting smokers to hold their child because of the smell and potential exposure is valid from a health perspective. Even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes, and that's a reasonable concern.\n\nThen there's the pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in close contact with infants. Whooping cough can be deadly for babies, so the author's requirement for up-to-date vaccination is also a safety measure. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccine, the author's stance is about protecting the child's health.\n\nHowever, the author is described as going out of their way to avoid these people. The question is whether this is being unreasonable. On one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries to protect their child. On the other hand, if these people are close friends or family, it might cause social tension. But the author's primary responsibility is to their child's well-being.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but based on the health risks, the author is justified. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). The author is taking reasonable precautions for their baby's health, and it's their right to set such boundaries even if others find it harsh.\n"
