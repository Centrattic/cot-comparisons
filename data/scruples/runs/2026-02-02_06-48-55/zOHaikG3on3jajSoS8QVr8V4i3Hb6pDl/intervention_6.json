So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They mentioned that other people are calling them a bitch for this, even though they provided reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They don't want smokers to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke, which can be harmful to infants. The CDC does warn about the dangers of secondhand smoke for babies, including increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). So from a health perspective, the author's concern is valid. Even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothing and skin, exposing the baby to harmful chemicals. So not allowing them to hold the baby seems like a responsible decision.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis is a serious illness for infants, and the immunity from the vaccine can wear off over time. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect newborns. If some people haven't updated their vaccination, they might be at higher risk of carrying the bacteria, which could be dangerous for the baby. The author's stance here is also medically sound.\n\nThe other people are criticizing the author, saying they're being harsh because the smokers shower and wash their hands, but those actions don't eliminate the risk from secondhand smoke. Also, the argument about not needing the updated vaccine is incorrect. The recommendation for the updated vaccine is based on medical advice to ensure protection. So the author is right to prioritize their baby's health despite others' opinions.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding those people in their home, which is their right. They shouldn't be blamed for making decisions to protect their child's health. The criticism from others for being a \"bitch\" is unfounded because the author is acting in their child's best interest. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
