So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near their two-month-old. The author is getting criticized for being a \"bitch\" for these restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so exposure to secondhand smoke is a big concern. The CDC and other health organizations definitely warn about the dangers of secondhand smoke to infants. So not allowing smokers near the baby is a reasonable precaution.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis can be deadly for infants, and while the vaccine is recommended, some people might not have the updated version. The author is being cautious here, which makes sense. The people in question might not realize the severity, but the author's stance is protective.\n\nThe other side is about the social dynamics. The author is being labeled as inconsiderate or harsh because others think they're being unhygienic. However, the author's reasons are health-based, not just personal dislike. The fact that people say they've washed their hands or showered daily doesn't eliminate the risk from smoke residues. Smoke particles can linger on clothes and skin even after washing.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like they're prioritizing their child's safety. The other people might feel excluded, but the parent's responsibility is to protect the baby. The author's actions are justified for health reasons. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
