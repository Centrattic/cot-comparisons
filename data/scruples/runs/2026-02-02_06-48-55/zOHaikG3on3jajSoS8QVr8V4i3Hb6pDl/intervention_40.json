So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the author has valid health concerns. Smoking around a baby is dangerous because of secondhand smoke, which can cause respiratory issues and other health problems. Even if smokers wash their hands or shower, they might still carry traces of nicotine or toxins on their skin, which can be harmful if the baby touches their face. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend avoiding all exposure to tobacco smoke for infants, so the author's stance here seems medically sound.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious illness for infants, especially under six months. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for close contacts to prevent transmission. The author is right to be cautious because unvaccinated adults can unknowingly spread it. The AAP and CDC both recommend that anyone in close contact with an infant should have the Tdap vaccine. So the author's requirement here is also based on medical advice.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their baby's health, which is a parent's right. The backlash from others calling them a \"bitch\" is not justified. The people who don't meet these criteria are making choices that could risk the baby's health, not the author. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have clear health reasons. It's not about being judgmental but about preventing preventable health risks.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decisions are based on protecting their child's well-being, which is a parent's responsibility. The answer should be B.\n"
