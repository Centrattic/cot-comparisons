So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main points are the author not wanting smokers near the baby and also not allowing those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. Secondhand smoke is definitely a concern for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends keeping babies away from smoke, even if the person is clean. The smell can irritate the baby and there's a risk from the lingering chemicals on clothes and skin. So the author's stance on smokers seems reasonable from a health perspective.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis is a serious illness for infants, especially under six months. The vaccine is recommended for close contacts to prevent spreading the disease. If some people haven't updated their vaccine, they could be carriers. The author's concern here is valid because the baby can't get the vaccine yet and is vulnerable. \n\nNow, the social aspect. The author is being called a \"bitch\" by others. That's a problem. How they enforce these boundaries might affect their relationships. But the author's health concerns are legitimate. The people in question might not realize the risks. However, the author's refusal isn't just about health; they also mention hygiene issues with the smokers. But the main argument is about the baby's safety.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they are acting in the best interest of their child, then no. It's about protecting a vulnerable infant. The people they're excluding might not understand the medical reasons, but the author isn't obligated to let anyone hold their child if they feel it's unsafe. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
