So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a new parent not wanting smokers or unvaccinated people around their two-month-old daughter. The parent has specific reasons: avoiding secondhand smoke and preventing whooping cough. But others are upset and call them a bitch, saying they've washed their hands and showered. The parent avoids these people's houses too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants, increasing the chance of sudden infant death syndrome, respiratory infections, and more. The CDC and other health organizations recommend keeping infants away from smokers. So the parent's stance there is likely justified.\n\nRegarding the whooping cough vaccine, the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those around infants. Whooping cough can be severe in babies, so not allowing unvaccinated people is a protective measure. The parent's reasoning here is also valid from a medical standpoint.\n\nThe other people's arguments that washing hands and showering make it okay are not addressing the actual risks. Smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on clothes and skin, which the baby could be exposed to even if someone has washed their hands. Similarly, vaccination status is a more effective preventive measure than handwashing for whooping cough.\n\nThe parent is setting boundaries to protect their child, which is their right. The reactions from others might be due to misunderstanding the health risks. The parent isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their child's safety. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
