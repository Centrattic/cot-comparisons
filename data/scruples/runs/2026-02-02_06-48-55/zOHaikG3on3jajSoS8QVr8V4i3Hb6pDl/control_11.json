So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people (specifically whooping cough) to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health risks. Secondhand smoke is definitely a serious issue, especially for infants. It can cause respiratory problems, SIDS, and other health issues. The parents have a right to protect their child from these dangers. Even if the smokers wash their hands, the smoke lingering on their clothes or in their hair could expose the baby. So, the parent's stance on smokers not holding the baby makes sense from a health perspective.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis) is highly contagious and can be deadly for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults, especially those around babies. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccine, they might not be protected and could spread the disease. The parent's decision to not let unvaccinated people near the baby is a precaution to prevent this risk.\n\nThe parent is also facing criticism from others, being called a \"bitch.\" But the parent's actions are based on protecting their child's health. The other people might not realize the severity of these risks. The parent isn't being inconsiderate; they're making informed decisions to safeguard their baby.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B. The parent isn't in the wrong. Their actions are reasonable and necessary for the baby's safety. The other people's reactions are dismissive of the actual health risks involved.\n"
