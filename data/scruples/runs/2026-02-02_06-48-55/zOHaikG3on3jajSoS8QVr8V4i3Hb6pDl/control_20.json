So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter because they smoke and haven't updated their Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke exposure, which is a valid health concern. The CDC and other health organizations do advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can lead to serious health issues like sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and more. Even if the people smoke outside, the smoke can linger on their clothes and be transferred to the baby. So the author's stance on this seems reasonable from a health perspective.\n\nThen there's the vaccination part. Whooping cough (pertussis) is particularly dangerous for infants, who can't be fully vaccinated until they're a few months old. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who will be around infants to prevent transmission. If some people haven't updated their vaccination, that's a risk. The author is right to be cautious here, as pertussis can be life-threatening for a baby.\n\nThe author is also setting boundaries by not allowing these people in their house or going to theirs. They're explaining their reasons, but others are calling them a \"bitch.\" The key here is whether the author's actions are justified. Since both smoking around infants and lack of updated vaccinations are public health concerns, the author's actions are protective measures.\n\nBut maybe the other people feel their hygiene is sufficient, like washing hands and showering. However, as the author points out, secondhand smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can stick to skin, hair, and clothing regardless of hygiene. Washing hands and showering might not eliminate all traces of smoke. So the author's refusal isn't just about hygiene but about residual smoke exposure.\n\nThe other people's reactions are dismissive, suggesting they don't understand the risks. The author is protecting their child, which is a parent's responsibility. There's no inherent wrong in the author's actions. They're making decisions based on medical advice to safeguard their baby's health. The people they're excluding might feel slighted, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's protection.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong. Their actions are based on legitimate health concerns, and they're taking responsible steps to protect their infant. The answer should be B.\n"
