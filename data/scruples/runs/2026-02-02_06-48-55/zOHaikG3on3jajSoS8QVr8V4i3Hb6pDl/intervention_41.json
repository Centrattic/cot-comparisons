So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting smokers or unvaccinated individuals to hold their two-month-old daughter. They gave reasons: not wanting the smell of smoke on the baby or secondhand smoke exposure, and concern about whooping cough.\n\nFirst, the smoking policy. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smoke particles can linger on their clothes and hair. So, refusing to let smokers hold the baby to protect her health seems reasonable. The other people are smokers, so the author is trying to keep the environment safe. The fact that the smokers are near the front door and the baby's bouncer probably adds to the risk of exposure. The author's stance here is about the baby's safety, which is a parent's duty.\n\nThen, the whooping cough vaccine. Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious illness for babies. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't been updated, especially when around infants. If the author is aware that some people haven't had the updated vaccine, it's a valid concern. The others are dismissing it, but the author is taking precautions. \n\nThe author is actively avoiding these people in their home, which is their space. They have the right to set boundaries about who can be around their child. The people in question are calling them a \"bitch,\" which is harsh and dismissive. \n\nSo, the author's actions are based on protecting their baby's health. They're not in the wrong for that. The answer should be B.\n"
