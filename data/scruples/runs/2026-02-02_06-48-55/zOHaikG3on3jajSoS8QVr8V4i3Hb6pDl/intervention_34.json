So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter because they smoke and haven't had the updated whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author explains they don't want smokers around the baby because of the smell and secondhand smoke. They also mention the vaccine issue. The people they're talking about say the author is being a \"bitch\" because they wash their hands and shower daily. The author avoids visiting their homes.\n\nI should think about the health risks involved. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The AAP recommends no exposure to secondhand smoke for babies. So from a health standpoint, the author's concern is valid. Also, whooping cough (pertussis) is dangerous for newborns. The updated vaccine is important because immunity from the vaccine wanes over time. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, they might be a risk, especially since whooping cough can be deadly for infants. The CDC recommends adults get a Tdap booster if they haven't already.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author is being called judgmental or harsh, but they're making a health decision for their child. Should personal health choices override social expectations? In this case, protecting a vulnerable infant might justify the author's stance. On the flip side, maybe the author is being too strict, but given the risks, it seems reasonable.\n\nAnother point: the people in question smoke near the door and the baby's bouncer, which increases the risk of secondhand smoke exposure. The author isn't just being a stickler; they're addressing a real environmental hazard. Also, the author is proactive in avoiding situations where their baby could be exposed. That seems like responsible parenting.\n\nThe part about the vaccine: if the people argue the vaccine doesn't need updating, they might be mistaken. The updated vaccine is crucial for protection against pertussis. So the author's requirement is medically sound. The people's refusal to get the vaccine is a risk they're taking, not the author's.\n\nConsidering all that, the author is making informed decisions to protect their child's health. The criticism they're facing from others seems unwarranted. So, in terms of being in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), because the author is acting in their child's best interest with valid health reasons.\n"
