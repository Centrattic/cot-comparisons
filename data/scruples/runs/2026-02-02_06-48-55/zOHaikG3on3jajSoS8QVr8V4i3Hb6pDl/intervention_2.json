So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a new parent who doesn't want certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are that some people smoke (a pack a day) and others haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. The author is being told they're a \"bitch\" for these restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Smoking is a big deal because secondhand smoke is harmful to infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell can linger on their clothes and hair. Infants are more vulnerable to respiratory issues, so avoiding secondhand smoke is a common precaution. So maybe the author is right to be cautious there.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Whooping Cough (pertussis) can be deadly for newborns. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in contact with infants. If some people haven't updated their vaccine, that could pose a risk. The author's stance on that seems valid too.\n\nThe other side is that friends or family are upset because they feel they're being judged for their hygiene (smoking) and vaccine status. They might feel excluded or that their habits are personal. The author is actively avoiding them, which could strain relationships. But is the author wrong for prioritizing their baby's health over social interactions?\n\nI think the author is within their rights to set boundaries for their child's safety. Health risks from smoking and lack of vaccination are real and preventable. The author's reasons are health-based, not just personal preference. So even if others are offended, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
