So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The main issues here are about not allowing smokers in the house and requiring the whooping cough vaccine for people near their baby.\n\nFirst, the writer doesn't want smokers to hold their baby, even if they've washed their hands. They mention that smokers are around the front door and near the baby's bouncer, so secondhand smoke exposure is a concern. They also don't allow people without the updated whooping cough vaccine to be near the baby. The people they're excluding argue that washing hands and showering makes them okay for the first issue, and that the whooping cough vaccine doesn't need updating for the second.\n\nI need to evaluate if the writer is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nRegarding the smoking issue: Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, especially for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that children should not be exposed to secondhand smoke. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell and particles from smoke can linger on their clothes and skin. So, the writer's concern is valid from a health perspective. The people being excluded might not realize the risks, but the writer has a right to protect their child's health.\n\nOn the whooping cough part: Whooping cough (pertussis) is very dangerous for infants, who can get severe complications. The vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time, so booster shots are recommended for adults, especially those in close contact with babies. If the writer is requiring the updated vaccine, it's a reasonable precaution. Those who haven't updated might be under the impression that their previous vaccination is sufficient, but medical guidelines do suggest booster shots for those in contact with infants.\n\nNow, are these requirements too strict? Maybe some people might feel it's being judgmental, but the parent's primary responsibility is to protect their child. The writer isn't forcing others to do these things but is choosing to limit interactions to ensure their baby's safety. It's a personal choice that prioritizes the child's health, which is generally considered acceptable.\n\nThe writer is facing backlash from friends or family, being called a \"bitch,\" which seems unfair. They're not being inconsiderate but making health-based decisions. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), as their actions are protective and medically supported.\n"
