So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new parent who doesn't want smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. They mentioned not wanting secondhand smoke exposure and the risk of whooping cough. Others are calling them a \"bitch\" and dismissing their concerns by saying they wash their hands and shower daily, and that the vaccine isn't necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the validity of the parent's concerns. For the smoking part, secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The CDC and other health organizations warn against exposing babies to smoke because it increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and other issues. Even if someone washes their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their skin and clothes, which is what the parent is worried about. So that's a legitimate health concern.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. The pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine is especially important for infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated themselves. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those around babies, to prevent them from passing the disease. Whooping cough can be severe in infants, leading to pneumonia, brain damage, or even death. So refusing the updated vaccine poses a real risk. The parent's stance here is also justified from a health and safety perspective.\n\nThe parent is taking precautions to protect their baby, which is a natural instinct. The friends' reactions\u2014calling them a \"bitch\"\u2014seem dismissive and not based on valid reasoning. The arguments about handwashing and showering don't address the actual risks from secondhand smoke or lack of vaccination. Hygiene with hands doesn't remove the residue or smell from smoke, and vaccination is a separate issue from hand hygiene.\n\nHowever, the parent is excluding people from their home or interactions. It's important to consider if there's a way to communicate these boundaries without being confrontational. Maybe the parent didn't explain the health reasons clearly, leading to misunderstandings. But the core of the issue is about the baby's safety, so the parent's rules are in the child's best interest.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. Their decisions are based on protecting their baby from preventable health risks. The friends' criticism is unwarranted. The answer should be B.\n"
