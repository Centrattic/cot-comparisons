So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the parent not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are that some people smoke a pack a day and others haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. The parent is avoiding these people, and others are calling them a \"bitch.\" The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the two main issues: smoking and the vaccine. \n\nStarting with the smoking part. The parent is concerned about secondhand smoke. Even if the smokers wash their hands and shower, there's still the risk of nicotine residue on their skin or in their hair. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has guidelines against exposing infants to secondhand smoke, and even thirdhand smoke (residue left after smoking) can be harmful. So, the parent's stance on not allowing smokers to hold the baby might be based on valid health concerns. The smokers washing hands and showering might reduce some risks but not eliminate the smell or thirdhand smoke. The parent's concern about the smell transferring to the baby's clothes or the baby inhaling secondhand smoke when the smokers are near the bouncer is understandable. \n\nThen there's the vaccine part. The parent doesn't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine near the baby. Pertussis is a serious illness for infants, and the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to update their protection, especially if they're around babies. The AAP and CDC recommend that all adults in contact with infants get the Tdap vaccine. If some people in the parent's circle haven't gotten the updated vaccine, the parent's decision to avoid them is in line with public health guidelines to protect the baby from preventable diseases.\n\nThe parent is actively avoiding these people, which might be causing some social friction. The other people are upset, calling the parent a \"bitch\" because they don't see the risk. But the parent is acting in the best interest of the baby's health. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the parent is setting boundaries to protect their child, which is a parent's right. On the other hand, the family and friends might feel excluded or offended. However, the parent's reasons are based on health and safety, which are significant. The smokers' argument about washing hands and showering doesn't address the health risks of secondhand or thirdhand smoke. Similarly, the people not getting the vaccine might not realize the importance of it for the baby's protection.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They are making responsible choices to protect their vulnerable infant. The response from others is more about social discomfort than valid health arguments. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
