So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves new parents not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are that some people smoke and others haven't gotten the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. The writer is being called a \"bitch\" by others for these restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the writer's concerns. The first issue is smoking. The writer doesn't want smokers to hold their baby because of the smell and potential secondhand smoke. The smokers argue that they've washed their hands and showered daily. But secondhand smoke exposure isn't just about personal hygiene; it's about the actual smoke they're inhaling. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that secondhand smoke increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and other health issues in infants. So even if someone showers, the residual smoke particles can still be present on their skin, hair, and clothes. Therefore, the writer's concern is medically valid.\n\nThe second issue is the Whooping Cough vaccine. The writer requires the updated vaccine, but some people claim it's not necessary. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants. The AAP recommends that all adults who haven't had the Tdap vaccine (which includes protection against pertussis) should get it, especially those who will be in close contact with infants. The writer is prioritizing the baby's health by ensuring others are vaccinated. Those who refuse might be putting the baby at risk.\n\nThe writer is also choosing not to have these people in their home, which is their right. People have the right to set boundaries in their own homes to protect their children's health. The fact that others are calling them a \"bitch\" for this seems like an overreaction. The writer is acting in their child's best interest, which is a common and justified reason for setting such boundaries.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any cultural or social context I'm missing. In some communities, being overly cautious might be frowned upon, but in terms of health and safety, the writer's actions are appropriate. The key is that they're not forcing people to interact but are protecting their child from known health risks.\n\nSo putting it all together, the writer isn't in the wrong. Their concerns are valid, based on medical advice, and they have the right to set boundaries to protect their infant.\n"
