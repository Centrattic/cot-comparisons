So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their stance on who can hold their baby. The author has two main points: not allowing smokers and requiring the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. \n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The author doesn't want smokers to hold their baby, even if they've washed their hands. The smokers argue that they're clean, but the author is concerned about the smell and secondhand smoke. From a health perspective, secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations recommend keeping infants away from secondhand smoke. So, even if a person washes their hands, the residual smoke on their clothes or in the environment could pose a risk. So the author's stance here seems medically sound.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is a serious illness for babies, and the immunity from the vaccine (Tdap) can wane over time. The updated vaccine is recommended for adults to protect infants. If some friends haven't had the updated shot, there's a risk they could pass the disease to the baby. The author's concern here is valid for protecting the child's health.\n\nThe friends are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which is a bit harsh. But the author is setting boundaries for their child's safety. It's their right to protect their baby from known health risks. The friends not getting the vaccine or continuing to smoke might be within their rights, but the author has the right to set personal boundaries regarding their child's environment. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing the baby's health. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
