So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the mother is in the wrong for not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold her two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the smoking issue. The mother doesn't want smokers to hold her baby, even if they've washed their hands. She's concerned about the baby smelling the smoke and potential secondhand exposure. The people involved argue that they wash their hands and shower daily, but they smoke a pack a day. The mother avoids having them in her house. \n\nI know that secondhand smoke is a health risk, even if someone just smells like smoke. The AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) recommends keeping infants away from secondhand smoke. So her reasoning seems valid here. The people's arguments about hygiene don't address the actual risk of residual smoke particles on their clothes or in their homes. \n\nThen there's the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine. The mother requires the updated vaccine, but some people don't get it, thinking the old vaccine is enough. Pertussis is a serious illness for infants, who can't breathe on their own and are at high risk. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect babies, so her stance is medically sound. The people in question are not getting the updated vaccine, which could leave her baby vulnerable.\n\nThe community's reaction is calling her a bitch, which is harsh. They're dismissing her valid health concerns. The mother is taking precautions to protect her child, which is her right as a parent. She's not being unreasonable; she's prioritizing her baby's health. \n\nSo putting it all together, she's not in the wrong. Her concerns are based on real health risks, and she's making decisions to keep her baby safe. The others are not respecting her boundaries when those boundaries are for the child's well-being.\n"
