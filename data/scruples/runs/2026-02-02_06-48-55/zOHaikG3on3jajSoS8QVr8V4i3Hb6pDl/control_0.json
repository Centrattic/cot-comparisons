So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them not wanting smokers or unvaccinated people around their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author doesn't want smokers to hold their baby because of secondhand smoke and the smell. They also don't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Others are calling them a bitch for this.\n\nSo, for smokers: Secondhand smoke is known to be harmful to infants. Even if someone washes their hands, the smoke residue (thirdhand smoke) can linger on their clothes and skin. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding secondhand smoke around babies. So, from a health standpoint, the author has a valid concern here.\n\nRegarding the vaccines: Whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious disease for infants. The vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it recently, especially those around babies. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccine, they could be a risk. The author is trying to protect their child, which is understandable.\n\nOthers are saying the author is being unreasonable because the smokers shower and wash hands, but that's not addressing the actual risk of smoke particles and the vaccine issue. The author is taking precautions based on medical advice. \n\nSo, considering the health risks and the recommendations from health organizations, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons to set these boundaries. People who criticize them might not be aware of the medical risks involved. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
