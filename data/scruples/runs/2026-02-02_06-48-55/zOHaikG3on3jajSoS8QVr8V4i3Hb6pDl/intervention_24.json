So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are that some people smoke a pack a day and others haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They don't want smokers to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke. Even if the people wash their hands and shower, the author is concerned about the smell and potential exposure. Then there's the vaccine issue\u2014Whooping Cough (pertussis) can be very dangerous for infants, so the author wants everyone near the baby to have the updated vaccine. The people in question don't think the updated vaccine is necessary.\n\nThe author is actively avoiding people who fit these categories, and others are calling them a \"bitch.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, both concerns are valid. Secondhand smoke exposure is harmful to infants, increasing the risk of respiratory issues, SIDS, etc. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations strongly advise against secondhand smoke exposure for children. Similarly, Whooping Cough is highly contagious and can be deadly for newborns. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in close contact with infants.\n\nSo, the author's reasons are based on legitimate health concerns. However, the people they're excluding might not see it the same way, leading to social friction. The author is making a personal choice about their child's safety, which is their right. But the question is whether they're in the wrong for doing so. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people might feel excluded or offended, but the author's priorities are their child's health. It's possible that the author is within their rights to set these boundaries, even if others are upset. The key here is whether their actions are justified by valid health reasons, which they are.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their decisions are based on protecting their child's health, which is a valid and responsible action.\n"
