So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding who can hold their two-month-old daughter. The situation involves two main points: not allowing smokers near the baby and requiring the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author refuses to let smokers hold their baby, even if they've washed their hands, because of secondhand smoke concerns and the lingering smell. They also avoid people who haven't had the updated whooping cough vaccine. The friends in question are upset, calling the author a \"bitch\" and arguing that hygiene (like washing hands and showering) is sufficient.\n\nNow, considering the health aspects: secondhand smoke is a known risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can cause respiratory issues, SIDS, and other health problems. Even if a person washes their hands, their clothes might still carry smoke residues, which can be harmful when they hold the baby. So the author's concern there is valid from a medical standpoint.\n\nRegarding the whooping cough vaccine, the recommendation is that adults who haven't been vaccinated recently, especially those in close contact with infants, should get the Tdap vaccine. Whooping cough is highly contagious and can be deadly for very young babies who can't be vaccinated yet. The author is following medical advice by ensuring visitors are up to date on this vaccine.\n\nThe friends' arguments are based on their own hygiene, which might not address the actual risks. The author has the right to set boundaries to protect their child's health. It's their responsibility to make decisions in the baby's best interest. While it's understandable that the friends might feel offended, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's safety. The term \"bitch\" is a judgment of the author's character, which isn't fair given the circumstances. So, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
