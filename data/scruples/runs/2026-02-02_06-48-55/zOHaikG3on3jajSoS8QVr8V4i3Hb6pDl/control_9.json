      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands. The reasoning is about the smell of smoke and secondhand smoke. Smokers are smoking a pack a day and do so near the front door where the baby's bouncer is. The author also avoids people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nThe other people are calling the author a \"bitch\" because they argue that washing hands and showering daily should be enough. The author, on the other hand, is concerned about hygiene and health risks from smokers and the lack of vaccination.\n\nHmm, so I need to decide if the author is wrong. Let's think about the health aspects. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can cause respiratory issues, SIDS, and other health problems. The smell alone might not be harmful, but the residue (called thirdhand smoke) can linger on clothes and surfaces. So, the author's concern here is valid from a health perspective.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, pertussis is a serious illness for infants. The AAP recommends that everyone in close contact with a newborn should have the Tdap vaccine, which protects against pertussis. The author's requirement for the updated vaccine makes sense to prevent the baby from getting a severe infection.\n\nNow, considering the other people's arguments. They say washing hands and showering is sufficient. But handwashing doesn't remove nicotine or other chemicals from their clothes or body. The author is right to be cautious because those residues can still affect the baby. Also, the fact that they smoke near the front door where the baby is adds to the risk.\n\nThe people's reaction calling the author a \"bitch\" seems dismissive of valid health concerns. It's unfair to label someone as harsh for protecting their child's health. The author is making decisions based on medical advice and the baby's best interests.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are precautionary measures to protect the infant from preventable health risks. The criticism from others is probably due to a lack of understanding or downplaying the real dangers of secondhand smoke and pertussis.\n"
