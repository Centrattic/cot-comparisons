So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for not wanting smokers or those without the Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their newborn. \n\nFirst, the parent's reasons. For the smokers: they smoke a pack a day, even though they wash hands and shower. The parent is concerned about the smell on the baby and secondhand smoke. But the others criticize them as a \"bitch\" despite the hygiene measures. The parent avoids these people in their home.\n\nRegarding the vaccine: they don't want people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine near the baby. Some argue it's not necessary, but the parent insists. The baby is two months old, so the first round of vaccines was two weeks ago. \n\nNow, medical perspective. Secondhand smoke is harmful to infants, increasing risks of SIDS, respiratory issues, etc. Even if someone washes or showers, the residual smoke particles can linger on their clothes and skin. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. So the parent's stance on smokers is medically supported.\n\nWhooping Cough (pertussis) is extremely dangerous for infants. The vaccine's effectiveness wanes over time, so boosters are recommended. If someone hasn't updated their vaccine, especially those who will be around a newborn, it's a valid precaution. The AAP and CDC recommend that caregivers get a pertussis booster to protect the baby.\n\nThe parent is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. The criticism they're receiving from others doesn't negate the medical reasons. It's about the baby's safety, not the preferences of others. The parent isn't being unreasonable; they're taking proactive steps. The answer should be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
