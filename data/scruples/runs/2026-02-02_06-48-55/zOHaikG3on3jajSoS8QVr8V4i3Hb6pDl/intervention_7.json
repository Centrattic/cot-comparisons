So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not allowing smokers or unvaccinated individuals to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They don't want smokers around because of secondhand smoke, which can be harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics does recommend avoiding secondhand smoke for babies due to the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory issues, and other health problems. So, from a health standpoint, the author's concern is valid.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine. Whooping cough can be severe in infants, and the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in close contact with babies. The author is concerned because some people haven't updated their vaccination. The CDC advises that adults should get a Tdap booster if they haven't already, to protect the baby. So again, there's a medical basis for the author's restrictions.\n\nThe author is facing criticism from others who call them a \"bitch\" and argue that washing hands or showering is enough. But secondhand smoke isn't just about smell; it's about particles in the air and on clothing that can linger. Similarly, vaccination isn't just about personal choice but also herd immunity and protecting vulnerable individuals like newborns. \n\nThe author's actions are about protecting their child's health. While it might be uncomfortable or inconvenient for others, the health risks are significant. The criticism from others seems to misunderstand the actual risks involved. So, the author isn't being unreasonable; they're making decisions based on medical advice to safeguard their baby. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
