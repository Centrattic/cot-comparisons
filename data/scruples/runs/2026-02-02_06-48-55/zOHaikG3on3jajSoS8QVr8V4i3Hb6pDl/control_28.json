So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The main points are about not allowing smokers or unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter. \n\nFirst, the parent doesn't want smokers to hold the baby. They mention that even if smokers wash their hands and shower, they still don't want them near the baby. The reasons given are to avoid the smell of smoke on the child and to prevent secondhand smoke exposure, especially since the smokers are near the baby's bouncer. The people involved are upset, calling the parent a \"bitch,\" which seems harsh. \n\nI know that secondhand smoke is dangerous for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics says secondhand smoke increases the risk of SIDS, respiratory infections, and other issues. So the parent's concern is valid from a health perspective. Even if someone showers or washes their hands, the residue from smoke (like thirdhand smoke) can linger on clothes and skin. So the parent's decision to keep smokers away makes sense for the baby's safety.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine issue. The parent requires the updated vaccine. Whooping cough is very dangerous for infants, especially under six months old. The AAP and CDC recommend that anyone in close contact with a newborn get the Tdap vaccine. If some friends haven't updated their vaccine, the parent has a legitimate reason to be cautious. Pertussis can be deadly for a baby who hasn't completed their vaccine series yet.\n\nThe people involved are offended, saying they're clean and vaccinated enough. But the parent's rules are for the baby's health and safety. The parent is setting boundaries to protect their child, which is a parent's right. The friends might not like it, but that doesn't make the parent wrong. They're not being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their child's well-being over social expectations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the parent isn't in the wrong. They're making informed decisions to protect their newborn from preventable health risks. The friends' reactions are more about their own feelings being hurt rather than the parent's actual wrongdoing.\n"
