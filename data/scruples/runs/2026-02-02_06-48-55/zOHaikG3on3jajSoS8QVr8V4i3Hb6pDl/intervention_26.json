So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The person has two main reasons: they don't want smokers to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke and the smell lingering on the baby or the clothing. The other reason is not allowing people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for and against the author being in the wrong. On one hand, the author is making decisions to protect their child's health. Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard, especially for infants, and pertussis (Whooping Cough) is a serious illness for babies. The CDC and other health organizations do recommend avoiding secondhand smoke and ensuring caregivers are vaccinated, including the Tdap vaccine for pertussis. So from a health perspective, the author is taking reasonable precautions.\n\nOn the other hand, others might argue that the author is being overly controlling or judgmental. The smokers in question have washed their hands and shower daily, which could be seen as attempts to comply with hygiene standards. Also, the people who haven't updated their vaccine might not be aware of the necessity, or they might have different opinions on vaccines. The author is actively avoiding these people, which could strain relationships. However, the author's primary responsibility is to their child's well-being, so prioritizing health over social considerations is understandable.\n\nThe key points here are the health risks versus social relationships. The author is making choices based on medical advice to protect their infant, which is a common and responsible action. The people being excluded are making their own choices (smoking, not updating vaccines), which the author is trying to mitigate. Since the author's decisions are in the best interest of their child's health and safety, it seems they are not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
