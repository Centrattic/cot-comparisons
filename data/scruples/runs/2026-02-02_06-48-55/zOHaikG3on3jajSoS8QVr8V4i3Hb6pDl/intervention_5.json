So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The author has two main reasons: not allowing smokers near the baby and requiring the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety concerns. Secondhand smoke is definitely a significant risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations strongly advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and other issues. So not allowing smokers to hold the baby seems like a reasonable precaution.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. Pertussis, or whooping cough, can be very severe in infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to get, especially those who will be around babies. The CDC advises that adults who haven't had the Tdap vaccine or a pertussis booster should get it to protect the baby. So the author's requirement for the updated vaccine is also a valid health precaution.\n\nThe author mentions that the people they're excluding are smokers who wash their hands and shower daily. However, washing hands and showering don't eliminate the presence of thirdhand smoke, which can linger on clothes and skin. The smell and particles from smoke can still affect the baby even if the person is clean. \n\nSome might argue that the author is being judgmental or too strict, but the author's primary concern is the baby's safety. Medical guidelines support avoiding secondhand smoke and ensuring caregivers are up to date on vaccines. So, from a health and safety standpoint, the author is acting in the baby's best interest. The friends might be upset, but the author's decisions are based on valid medical reasons. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
