So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a new parent who doesn't want smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They've explained their reasons\u2014avoiding secondhand smoke and the risk of pertussis. However, others are calling them a \"bitch\" for these restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease, especially for infants. The vaccine is updated because immunity can wane over time. Even if someone had the vaccine before, not getting the updated version might leave them susceptible, which could then be passed to the baby. So, from a medical standpoint, not having the updated vaccine could be a valid concern.\n\nRegarding the smokers, secondhand smoke is harmful to infants. It can cause respiratory issues, increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and affect the baby's developing lungs. The fact that the smokers wash their hands but still smoke near the baby's bouncer is a problem because the smoke lingers in the air and on surfaces. Handwashing alone doesn't remove the lingering nicotine or smoke particles. So the author's stance here is about protecting the child from environmental toxins.\n\nNow, the other people involved are saying the author is being unreasonable. They argue that washing hands and showering daily is enough. But the author is making a distinction between hand hygiene and the residual effects of smoking. It's possible the others don't fully grasp the risks or are defensive about their habits. The author's actions\u2014limiting visitors\u2014are their way of enforcing these rules to protect the baby.\n\nThe question is whether these rules are justified. From a health perspective, both the smoking and vaccine issues are valid concerns. The author is prioritizing the child's safety, which is a parent's right. The social judgment from others (\"you're a bitch\") might stem from not understanding the medical reasons or feeling excluded. However, the author is within their rights to set boundaries for their child's well-being.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author is making rules to protect their child. Unless there's a legal or ethical violation (which there doesn't seem to be), the author isn't in the wrong. The other people might be inconsiderate for not respecting these boundaries, but the author isn't. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
