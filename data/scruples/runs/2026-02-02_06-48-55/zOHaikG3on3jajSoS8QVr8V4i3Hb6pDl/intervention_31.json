So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding not allowing smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their baby. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't want smokers to hold their child because of the smell and secondhand smoke. They also don't allow people who haven't updated their whooping cough vaccine. Others are calling them a \"bitch\" for these rules.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. I need to consider public health guidelines here. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful, especially to infants. It can cause respiratory issues, so avoiding that is a valid health measure. Whooping cough (pertussis) is also a serious disease for babies, and the vaccine is recommended for those in close contact with infants.\n\nSo, the author is setting boundaries based on health concerns. The people they're excluding aren't following medical recommendations. The author is protecting their child, which is a parent's right. The arguments from others that washing hands or daily showers are enough don't address the actual risks. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're prioritizing their child's health. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
