So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting smokers and unvaccinated people to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they don't want smokers to hold their baby because of secondhand smoke and the smell. They also don't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Others are calling them a bitch for setting these boundaries, even though the smokers wash their hands and shower daily. The author avoids having them over or visiting their homes.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to check. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, parents have the right to protect their child's health. Secondhand smoke is dangerous for infants, increasing the risk of respiratory issues, SIDS, etc. Whooping Cough (pertussis) is a serious disease that can be life-threatening for newborns, and the vaccine is recommended to be updated every 10 years. So, not allowing unvaccinated people near the baby could be a valid precaution.\n\nOn the other hand, others might feel that the author is being overly strict or exclusionary. But given the health risks, especially for a two-month-old with an underdeveloped immune system, the author's concerns are medically sound. The fact that the smokers are around the baby's bouncer and front door could expose the child to lingering smoke particles, which washing hands alone doesn't eliminate. The author's reasons are health-based, not just personal preference.\n\nThe people in question are smokers and unvaccinated, which are preventable risks. The author isn't being cruel but is setting boundaries to protect their child. The criticism from others for being a \"bitch\" seems unfounded here. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
