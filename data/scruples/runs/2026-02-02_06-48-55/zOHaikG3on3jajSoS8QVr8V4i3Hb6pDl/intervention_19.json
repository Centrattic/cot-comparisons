So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main points are about not allowing smokers or unvaccinated people near their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they washed their hands. They mention not wanting the smell of smoke on the baby or secondhand smoke exposure. Then, they also don't allow people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. Others are calling them a bitch for this.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out based on common knowledge and typical advice given in such situations.\n\nFor the smoking part: Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations say that secondhand smoke can cause serious health issues in babies, like SIDS, respiratory infections, and more. So even if someone washes their hands, they might still carry the smell and nicotine on their skin. The author's concern is valid for the baby's health. So maybe the author is not in the wrong here.\n\nFor the vaccine part: Whooping cough (pertussis) is really dangerous for infants, who can't be vaccinated until they're a few months old. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to get a booster. If someone hasn't had the updated vaccine, especially if they're in close contact with a baby, it's a risk. Public health guidelines do suggest that people in contact with infants should be up to date with their vaccines. So the author's precaution is also reasonable.\n\nOthers are upset because they think washing and showering is enough for smokers, or they don't see the need for the vaccine. But the author is prioritizing the baby's health. So the question is, is the author overstepping by enforcing these rules? Or is it a valid health precaution?\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's understandable that friends might feel it's too strict, as a parent, you have the right to set boundaries to protect your child's health. It's a parenting choice. So the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), because they're acting in their child's best interest based on medical advice.\n"
