So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong regarding their policies about who can hold their two-month-old daughter. The key points here are the restrictions against smokers and those without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author\u4e0d\u8ba9smokers hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands. The reasoning is to avoid the smell of smoke and secondhand smoke from being near the baby's bouncer. Now, secondhand smoke is a known health hazard for infants, right? The CDC and other health organizations do advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can lead to serious health issues like SIDS, respiratory infections, and asthma. So, from a health perspective, the author's concern is valid. But the argument here is that the people in question have washed their hands and shower regularly. However, washing hands doesn't eliminate the risk of secondhand smoke exposure, especially if they smoke near the baby's area. The smell clinging to their clothes or the environment is a separate issue from hand hygiene. So, maybe the author is justified in this restriction.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine part. The author\u4e0d\u8ba9anyone who hasn't had the updated vaccine near the baby. Pertussis is extremely dangerous for infants, and the Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults to protect the baby, especially since the vaccine's protection wanes over time. If the people they know haven't updated their vaccine, the author is taking a precautionary measure. Some might argue that if these people are healthy and have no coughing symptoms, maybe the risk is low, but the medical advice is to ensure up-to-date vaccination around infants. So this seems like a reasonable precaution too.\n\nNow, the backlash the author is receiving. They're being called a \"bitch\" for setting these boundaries. That's pretty harsh. People might not understand the health risks, especially if they themselves are smokers or don't see the necessity of the vaccine. But the author's actions are based on medical advice, even if others find it inconvenient. It's their right to protect their child, and being upset about that is not their fault. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether their concerns are valid and if their boundaries are reasonable. Since both the vaccine and secondhand smoke are legitimate health risks, and the author is taking steps to mitigate them, they are acting in the child's best interest. The criticism from others who don't adhere to these precautions is misplaced. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
