So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not allowing smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter. They mentioned that others are calling them a \"bitch\" for this, and they actively avoid these people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. The author is concerned about secondhand smoke, which is a known health hazard for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics does advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can lead to respiratory issues, infections, and even sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). So, the author's stance on not allowing smokers to hold their baby is medically justified.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine is another important factor. Pertussis can be severe in infants, leading to pneumonia, brain damage, or death. The Tdap vaccine, which includes protection against pertussis, is recommended for adults who haven't been vaccinated, especially those who will be around infants. The author is requiring the updated vaccine, which makes sense as immunity can wane over time. The fact that some people refuse to get the updated vaccine could put the baby at higher risk if they're not immune.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries for their child's safety, which is the parent's right. However, they're being criticized by others who don't understand or agree with these decisions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a health perspective, their precautions are valid. Socially, people might be offended because they feel excluded or misunderstood, but the parent's primary responsibility is to their child's well-being.\n\nThe author is not being cruel; they're making informed decisions based on medical advice. The term \"bitch\" is a strong and derogatory term, which might indicate that the critics are not taking the author's concerns seriously. The author's actions are protective, not malicious. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
