So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter due to smoking and lack of updated Whooping Cough vaccines.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby, even if they've washed their hands, because of secondhand smoke exposure. They also require the Whooping Cough vaccine. Others are upset, calling the author a \"bitch\" and arguing that hygiene (like washing hands and showering) is sufficient. The author avoids these people's homes as well.\n\nSo, the main issues are the health concerns related to smoking and the vaccine. Let's break it down. \n\nSmoking: Secondhand smoke is a known health hazard. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations advise against exposing infants to secondhand smoke. Even if someone has washed their hands, the act of smoking in proximity to the baby's environment (like near the front door where the baby's bouncer is) could pose a risk. So, the author's concern here is valid from a health perspective.\n\nWhooping Cough Vaccine: Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is a serious illness for infants. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those who will be around babies. The CDC recommends that adults get the Tdap vaccine if they haven't already. If the friends haven't had the updated vaccine, the author's caution is justified because pertussis can be life-threatening for newborns.\n\nNow, the friends are upset, claiming that washing hands and showering is enough. However, those measures don't eliminate the risk of secondhand smoke particles or pertussis if the person is unvaccinated. The author is prioritizing their baby's health, which is their right as a parent.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is setting boundaries based on health risks. They're not being hostile but are making choices to protect their child. The friends' reactions seem to stem from not understanding the severity of the health risks. The author isn't wrong for making these decisions, even if it causes strain in relationships. Parents have the right to make decisions they believe are in their child's best interest, especially regarding health and safety.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are acting responsibly to protect their infant from preventable health risks.\n"
