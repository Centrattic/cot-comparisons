So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The key points are the author's reasons: they don't want smokers (who smoke a pack a day) to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke and the smell, even if they've washed their hands. Also, they don't allow people who haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Secondhand smoke is a known risk to infants, causing respiratory issues and other health problems. Even if the smokers wash their hands, the smell might linger and expose the baby. Also, whooping cough (pertussis) is a serious illness for infants, which can be life-threatening. The updated vaccine is important because immunity can wane over time. \n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child's health. The other people are criticizing the author as being a \"bitch,\" which seems dismissive of the health concerns. The smokers might not realize the full extent of the risks, especially the lingering effects of their smoking environment around the baby. The people without the updated vaccine might not understand the importance of the pertussis booster for infants.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being overly cautious or excluding friends and family. But given the potential health risks to the baby, which are well-documented, the author's concerns are valid. The decision to enforce these rules is a parent's right to protect their child. The other people's reactions seem to downplay the medical advice, which is not in the best interest of the baby.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is not in the wrong. Their actions are based on protecting their child's health, and they have the right to set those boundaries.\n"
