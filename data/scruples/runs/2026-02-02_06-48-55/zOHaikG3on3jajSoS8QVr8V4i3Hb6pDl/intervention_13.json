So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The situation involves two main points: not allowing smokers near the baby and requiring the whooping cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, the author doesn't want smokers to hold the baby because of secondhand smoke. Even though the smokers say they wash their hands and shower, the author is concerned about residual smoke particles. I know that secondhand smoke is harmful, especially to infants. It can cause respiratory issues and other health problems. So even if they shower, there might still be nicotine residue on their skin or clothes. The author's stance here seems to be about protecting the baby's health, which is a valid concern.\n\nThen there's the whooping cough vaccine. The author requires the updated vaccine, but some people argue they don't need it. Whooping cough is a serious disease for infants; it can lead to pneumonia, brain damage, or even death. The vaccine is recommended for those around newborns, often called the Tdap shot. If the friends aren't vaccinated, they could pose a risk. The author is prioritizing their child's safety over others' potential discomfort in getting a vaccine.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The friends are calling the author a \"bitch,\" which suggests they're upset. But is the author justified? Health risks to a baby are significant. As a parent, protecting the child from preventable dangers is a responsibility. So even if the friends feel excluded or offended, the author's actions are about the baby's well-being. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could communicate this more gently. But the core issue is the health and safety of the infant. So I don't think the author is in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
