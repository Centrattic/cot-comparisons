So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a new parent who has two main rules: no smokers holding their two-month-old daughter, even if they've washed their hands, and no one without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine can be near the baby. The author faces backlash from others, who call them a \"bitch\" for enforcing these rules.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety aspects. Smoking around infants is a significant concern. Secondhand smoke is linked to various health issues like SIDS, respiratory infections, and asthma. Even if smokers wash their hands, the smell of smoke can linger on their clothes and skin, which the baby could be exposed to. The author's concern about this is valid because the smell can be harmful and stressful for the baby.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine, the author is requiring the updated version. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) is particularly dangerous for infants under six months, as their immune systems are weak. The Tdap booster is recommended for adults to protect against pertussis. If others aren't updated, they might be at risk of transmitting the disease, even if they don't show symptoms. The author is justified in taking precautions here.\n\nThe author's actions are about protecting their child's health. The criticism from others might stem from discomfort with these strict rules, but the parent has every right to set boundaries to safeguard their child. The term \"bitch\" is a derogatory reaction and doesn't address the validity of the health concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is excluding people from their home, which could lead to social tension. However, the parent's primary responsibility is the child's well-being. The people in question have a choice to respect the rules or not participate. The author isn't imposing their rules on others beyond their own home, which is their right.\n\nSo, considering health risks and parental rights, the author is in the right. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
