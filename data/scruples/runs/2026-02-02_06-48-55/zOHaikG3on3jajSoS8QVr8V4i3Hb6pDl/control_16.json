So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The main reasons given are not wanting smokers near the baby and requiring the Whooping Cough vaccine. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the health aspects. Secondhand smoke is definitely harmful to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it can cause respiratory issues, SIDS, and other problems. So, the author's concern about smokers is valid from a health perspective.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine. Pertussis is a serious illness for infants, and the risk is highest in the first few months. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults who haven't had it, especially those in close contact with babies. If the people in question haven't gotten the updated vaccine, they could be a risk. The author is right to be cautious here, even if others disagree.\n\nThe author is setting boundaries to protect their child, which is a parent's responsibility. The criticism they're facing from others (being called a \"bitch\") seems unwarranted given the health risks involved. While it's understandable that people might feel excluded, the parent's priority is their child's well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
