So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting smokers or people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to hold their two-month-old daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a two-month-old baby and has clear boundaries about who can hold her. They don't allow smokers because of secondhand smoke concerns, even if the smokers wash their hands. They also don't allow people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. However, the people they're referring to are calling the author a \"bitch\" and questioning their rules.\n\nNow, considering the health aspects. Secondhand smoke is a serious risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations strongly advise against any exposure to secondhand smoke for babies because it can lead to respiratory issues, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other health problems. So, the author's stance on not wanting smokers around their child is well-founded from a medical perspective.\n\nRegarding the Whooping Cough vaccine (pertussis), it's especially important for infants who can't be vaccinated until they're about two months old. The CDC recommends that all people in close contact with infants get the Tdap vaccine to protect them from pertussis, which can be life-threatening for babies. If the people in question haven't updated their vaccines, that's a legitimate concern. Even if they had the original vaccine, immunity wanes over time, so boosters are necessary. The author is right to be cautious here.\n\nThe people the author is avoiding are criticizing them for being a \"bitch\" because they wash their hands and shower daily. However, handwashing and showering don't eliminate the risk of secondhand smoke. Nicotine and other chemicals from smoking can linger on clothing and skin, transferring to the baby even after washing. So, the author's refusal is based on valid health concerns, not just personal preference.\n\nThe author is also restricting where the smokers come into the house, like near the baby's bouncer. This is another precaution to minimize exposure. The fact that they actively avoid going to these people's houses shows they're trying to protect their child's environment.\n\nThe people's response to calling the author a \"bitch\" seems dismissive of the health risks. Their argument about hygiene is a red herring because it doesn't address the actual issues of smoke and vaccination. The author has the right to set boundaries to protect their child's health, especially when there are medical guidelines supporting their decisions.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it might feel exclusionary, parents have the right to make decisions they believe are in their child's best interest. The author isn't being mean-spirited; they're acting out of concern for their baby's safety. The other people's reactions might stem from not understanding the medical reasons or feeling personally attacked, but that doesn't make the author wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are justified based on health recommendations and parental responsibility. The people they're excluding aren't following medical advice that directly impacts the baby's safety. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
