So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The reasons given are that some people smoke a pack a day and others haven't had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine. The author is being called a \"bitch\" by others for these restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the health and safety of the baby. Newborns have underdeveloped immune systems, so exposure to secondhand smoke can be dangerous. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly advises against exposing infants to secondhand smoke because it increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory infections, and ear infections. So, from a medical standpoint, the author's concern about smokers is valid. Even if smokers wash their hands, the smell and residue from smoke can linger on their clothes and skin, which the baby can inhale. So the author's stance on not allowing smokers to hold her baby seems reasonable.\n\nNext, the Whooping Cough (pertussis) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults, especially those who will be in close contact with infants, because pertussis can be life-threatening for babies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a Tdap booster for adults not previously vaccinated or who haven't had a booster in the last 10 years. If the author's friends haven't had the updated vaccine, they could potentially carry the bacteria and infect the baby. Therefore, requiring up-to-date pertussis vaccination is a precaution that's supported by medical guidelines.\n\nThe author is also taking steps to avoid having these individuals in their home, which is their right as a parent. While others may feel offended, the primary responsibility of a parent is to protect their child's health. The author isn't being cruel but is setting boundaries to ensure safety. The criticism from others seems to stem from not understanding the medical risks involved.\n\nHowever, there might be a need for the author to communicate their reasons calmly and provide information about the health risks. But the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the medical evidence supporting both precautions, it's clear that the author's actions are in the baby's best interest. Therefore, the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
