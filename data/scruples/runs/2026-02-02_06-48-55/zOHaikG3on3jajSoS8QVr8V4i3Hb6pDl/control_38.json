So I actively go out of my way not to have them in my house or go to theirs.\n\n I also don\u2019t allow anyone who hasn\u2019t had the updated Whooping Cough vaccine to be near her either (everyone I know has all the others but there is a few that don\u2019t have the Whooping Cough vaccine) but according to them it doesn\u2019t need to be updated so they don\u2019t go and get it. \n\nWhat do you think? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing certain people to hold their two-month-old daughter. The two main reasons given are not wanting smokers around the baby and not allowing people without the updated Whooping Cough vaccine.\n\nFirst, smoking. The author refuses smokers, even if they wash their hands, because of secondhand smoke and the smell. The other people argue that washing hands and showering is enough. But I know that secondhand smoke is a significant health risk for infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no exposure to secondhand smoke for babies. So the author is acting to protect their child's health here, which is a valid concern. The others might not see it as a big deal, but the author's stance is medically supported.\n\nThen there's the Whooping Cough vaccine. The author requires the updated vaccine because whooping cough (pertussis) is extremely dangerous for infants. Even if someone had the vaccine years ago, immunity can wane. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for adults, especially those around infants. If the friends haven't updated their vaccine, they could pose a risk. The author's requirement is based on medical advice to prevent the baby from getting a severe illness.\n\nThe author is also dealing with pushback from others calling them a \"bitch,\" which is a bit harsh. The author is setting boundaries to protect their child, which is a parent's right. The friends not following medical recommendations (smoking and not getting the vaccine) are the issues here, not the author's boundaries.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They're making health-conscious decisions for their baby. The friends aren't respecting that, but the author has the right to protect their child. Answer B.\n"
