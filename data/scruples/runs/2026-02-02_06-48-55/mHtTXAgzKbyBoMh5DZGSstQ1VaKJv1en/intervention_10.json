He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who talks to her ex, and the author feels it's okay, but when his girlfriend gets mad at him for chatting with a female coworker, he considers confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally. The author doesn't mind this, which is his choice. The issue comes when the author's girlfriend gets upset about him talking to a female coworker. The author is pointing out the inconsistency: why is it okay for her to have a past relationship, but not for him to have a female friend at work?\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key here is whether the author's actions (chatting over lunch) are reasonable. The coworker is described as a friend since work started, only for work reasons, and the author never pursued anything with her. So, the interaction is likely platonic and professional.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on jealousy or insecurity, possibly projecting her own past (her ex) onto the author. The author is pointing out a double standard, which might be valid if the girlfriend is applying different rules to her ex (who is in the past) versus the author's current interactions.\n\nHowever, the way the author is approaching the situation matters. If he's bringing it up to be confrontational without considering her feelings, that could be problematic. But if he's trying to address the inconsistency in a respectful way, it might be fair. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for initiating the discussion.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having a female coworker friend. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own insecurities. However, how the author handles the confrontation is important. If he's using it to point out the double standard rather than being disrespectful, he might not be in the wrong. But if he's being manipulative or trying to turn the tables without addressing the actual issue, that could be an issue.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's from the girlfriend's perspective. The author's actions are within the bounds of normal friendship, so maybe he's not in the wrong. The real issue is the girlfriend's jealousy and the author addressing it. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
