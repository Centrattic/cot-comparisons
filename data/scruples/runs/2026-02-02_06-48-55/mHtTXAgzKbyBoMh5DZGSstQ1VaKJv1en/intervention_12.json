He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about a conversation with a female coworker, while the author points out that his girlfriend regularly talks to an ex. The key here is about mutual respect and communication in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's reaction to seeing the author talking to his coworker. Even if the coworker is just a friend, the girlfriend's jealousy is a valid emotion. But the author's response was to compare her to his ex, which might not be fair. The ex is mentioned as someone she talks to about home and mutual friends, but the author's coworker is someone he's never seen outside work and only talks to for work. The author is using the girlfriend's ex as a reason to justify his own behavior, which could be seen as a form of manipulation or deflecting his own actions.\n\nHowever, the author's point is about consistency. If the girlfriend is allowed to talk to her ex, why can't he talk to his coworker? There might be a double standard here. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in her expectations. But the way he's doing it\u2014turning the tables by bringing up the ex\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. Instead of addressing the issue directly and respectfully, he's using it as a weapon, which can escalate conflicts rather than resolve them.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author should have discussed his concerns calmly instead of using a confrontational approach. The girlfriend's reaction was to \"lose her shit,\" which might be an overreaction, but it's also possible she felt insecure. The author's response, while highlighting a double standard, might have been done in a way that's not constructive. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both sides have valid points. The girlfriend's jealousy is a red flag if it's based on unfounded suspicions, but the author's behavior of pointing out the ex as a way to justify his own actions could be seen as inconsiderate. The right approach would be for both to communicate openly without using comparisons that can lead to arguments. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not entirely in the wrong for pointing out a possible double standard, but his method of addressing it (using the ex as a counter) might be problematic. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's responding to what he perceives as unfair treatment, but his method is flawed, it's a bit of a gray area. But the main issue is that he's using a confrontational tactic that might not be healthy for the relationship. Therefore, the answer would lean towards Yes (A) because he's contributing to the conflict by not addressing the issue constructively.\n"
