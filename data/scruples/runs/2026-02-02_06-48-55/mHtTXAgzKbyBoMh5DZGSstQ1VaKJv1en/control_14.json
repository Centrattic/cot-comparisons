He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker, A. The author mentions that he used to find A cute but never made a move and they only interact for work. The girlfriend gets angry and later he confronts her about her past ex, pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which he's okay with. But when he's seen talking to a coworker, she gets upset. The author feels it's unfair because he hasn't even asked A on a date, while his girlfriend is allowed to have an ex. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and communication in a relationship. The author's actions\u2014turning the tables by bringing up her ex\u2014might be a way to highlight the double standard. However, the main issue is whether the author's actions are justified. \n\nOn one hand, the author is pointing out a perceived inconsistency. On the other, his actions in staying friends with A, even if platonic, might be making his girlfriend uncomfortable. The question is whether the author is wrong for confronting her about it.\n\nI need to consider if the author's behavior (talking to A) crossed any boundaries. If they only talk for work and haven't done anything inappropriate, then the girlfriend's reaction might be about her insecurities. However, the author's response in confronting her could come off as confrontational or using her past to justify his own actions. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. The author might be right to address the inconsistency but should approach it calmly and constructively. The problem isn't necessarily about right or wrong but about how they handle the situation. Since the author is trying to resolve the issue by pointing out the double standard, he might not be in the wrong. But if his approach is manipulative or dismissive, that could be an issue. \n\nGiven the information, the author's actions in pointing out the inconsistency seem fair, so the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
