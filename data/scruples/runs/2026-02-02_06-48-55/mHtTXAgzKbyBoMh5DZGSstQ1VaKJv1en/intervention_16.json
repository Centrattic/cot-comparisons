He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who's upset because his girlfriend got mad at him for chatting with a female coworker. He turns the tables by pointing out that she has an ex she still talks to. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend sees the author talking to coworker A during lunch and gets upset. The author then confronts her about her ex, implying hypocrisy. The user is asking if the author is wrong for doing this.\n\nHmm, so let's consider both sides. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or insecurity, even if it's not justified. On the other hand, the author is using her ex as a way to justify his own actions. Is that fair? Maybe not. The author's coworker is just a colleague, and he hasn't done anything inappropriate. The girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, and if they maintain a friendship, that's different from the current situation.\n\nBut the author's response could be seen as using a comparison that's not entirely parallel. The ex is from the past, while the coworker is a current situation. The author might be trying to deflect his own feelings or validate his behavior by pointing out her inconsistency. That can come across as manipulative or unfair. It's important to address the issue directly instead of using a comparison that might not hold up.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he never made a move on coworker A and only has her number for work. So, there's no indication of any romantic interest. If the girlfriend is upset without cause, that's her issue. But the author's response of bringing up her ex might not be the healthiest way to resolve the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of turning the tables, maybe the author should have discussed his feelings about her reaction first. However, pointing out hypocrisy isn't necessarily wrong, but the way he does it could be problematic. If the girlfriend's behavior is inconsistent, bringing it up might be valid, but it's how it's approached that matters.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's reaction is unwarranted, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if his way of addressing it is more about deflecting than solving the problem, then perhaps he is. The answer might depend on the context of their relationship and past behaviors. Since the author hasn't done anything wrong (no advances towards coworker A), but is using a comparison that might not be fair, maybe he's in the wrong for not addressing his own feelings constructively.\n\nWait, but the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. I need to make sure. The key is whether the author's actions (using the ex as a comparison) are justified. If the author is just pointing out hypocrisy, maybe not in the wrong. But if he's being manipulative or trying to deflect, then yes. Since the author is trying to call her out on inconsistency, maybe it's a valid point. However, the way he's approaching it (during a conflict) might not be the best approach. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not the approach.\n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's pointing out a double standard in her behavior. However, the way he does it could be improved. But in terms of being in the wrong, since he's not doing anything inappropriate with coworker A, and she's upset without cause, he's not in the wrong for pointing out her hypocrisy.\n"
