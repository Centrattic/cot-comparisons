He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on their girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being upset about him chatting with a coworker, while she has an ex she talks to regularly.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, and they talk about home and friends. The author's coworker, A, is a friend from work, and they only interact there. The author hasn't made any romantic moves on A. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting during lunch. The author then confronts her about the double standard, comparing her ability to be friends with an ex to his situation with a coworker.\n\nNow, the author's argument is about fairness and double standards. The girlfriend is upset about his friendship with a coworker, but she has a friendship with an ex. The author feels it's unfair and wants to call her out on it.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a difference in the relationships. The ex is someone the girlfriend had a past romantic relationship with, which might be more sensitive. The coworker is just a friend from work, and the author hasn't shown any romantic interest. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity, even if the coworker isn't a threat. The author's response is pointing out the inconsistency, which could be valid if the rules aren't equally applied. However, the author's approach might be confrontational. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, they're bringing up the ex, which might not be fair because the contexts are different. The ex is a past romantic partner, which is inherently different from a coworker friend. The author is trying to equate the two, but they aren't the same. The girlfriend might have a right to be concerned about her partner interacting with someone she used to be intimate with, whereas the author's coworker situation is less problematic. So, the author might be in the wrong by not recognizing that the ex situation is different. They're using their own behavior as a justification without considering the unique contexts. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
