He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user is a guy whose girlfriend talks to her ex all the time. He's okay with that, as they don't talk often and it's about mutual friends and stuff. Then, there's this coworker, A, who he's been friends with since starting the job. He used to think she was cute but hasn't made a move, and only has her number for work. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch, got mad, and was upset. The guy is now considering bringing up the hypocrisy of her being friends with her ex versus him being friends with A.\n\nFirst, let's look at the girlfriend's perspective. She's with her ex, but he's a few hours away, and they don't talk often. The guy's reasoning is that his girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex, but he can't even have a friendly coworker. That seems unfair. The key points here are the nature of the relationships and the level of interaction.\n\nThe girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, so maintaining a friendship might be typical. However, if the ex is a current or recent partner, it might be different. The user says they don't talk often and are just discussing mutual topics, so maybe it's a healthy friendship. On the other hand, the coworker A is someone the user has known for a while, but he hasn't made any romantic moves and only interacts with her for work. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on jealousy or insecurity, perhaps feeling that the coworker is a threat to their relationship.\n\nThe user's argument is about fairness: if the girlfriend can have an ex-friend, why can't he have a friend from work? That seems valid. The user isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining a professional relationship with a coworker where there's no romantic intent. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity rather than the actual actions of the user. \n\nBut wait, the user is considering bringing this up. Is that fair? It could come off as a passive-aggressive way to point out her hypocrisy. However, it's also about addressing an inconsistency in how they handle relationships. The user isn't in the wrong for being friends with A, especially if there's no romantic interest. The girlfriend's behavior is the issue here, as she's reacting negatively to a normal workplace friendship without valid reason. \n\nSo, the user is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
