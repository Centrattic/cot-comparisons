He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, which he's okay with. Then the author has a female coworker named A, who he's just friends with and never made a move on. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got upset. The author is now considering bringing up the hypocrisy.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally. The author has a female coworker he's friends with but hasn't pursued anything with. The girlfriend got mad when she saw them together. The author is upset because he feels it's double standards. \n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The key here is whether the author did something wrong. The author says he and A are just friends, no romantic interest. The girlfriend, however, is in a relationship and is friends with her ex. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend is talking to her ex regularly, but the author is restricted from being friends with a coworker, that's a problem. The author is highlighting that his actions (platonically) are being judged more harshly than her similar interactions with her ex. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from possessiveness or insecurity. However, the author hasn't done anything wrong by her own standards if she allows her ex but restricts him. The author is not in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. But maybe the way he approached it could be an issue. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not the approach. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The main point is the double standard in how each partner is allowed to interact with former partners versus others. The author's actions are more about highlighting the unfairness rather than doing something wrong himself.\n"
