He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker, even though he's never pursued her. The author is upset because his girlfriend talks to her ex, and he's considering calling her out on it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author's girlfriend is jealous of his interaction with a coworker, which he didn't pursue. But he's pointing out that she's friends with her ex, which he didn't mind before. The key here is whether the comparison is fair. The author's friend is a coworker he's never dated, while the ex is a past relationship. The girlfriend's ex is a different situation because they had a history, which can naturally lead to stronger emotional ties and potential jealousy. \n\nThe author's action of bringing up the ex's friendship to justify his own situation might come off as using a double standard. Jealousy can be situational and emotional. The coworker is just a colleague, whereas the ex had a romantic past, which might explain the girlfriend's reaction. The author might be ignoring the emotional weight of a past relationship versus a professional acquaintance. \n\nAlso, the author had the chance to address the coworker interaction before it became an issue. If he didn't clarify then, maybe he's contributing to the misunderstanding. Now, bringing it up after the fact could seem like he's deflecting his own responsibility. The question is whether his actions were reasonable or if he's overreacting by using the ex as a counterexample.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author might be trying to even the score, but this approach could escalate the conflict instead of resolving it. The answer might lie in whether the author's actions were justified based on the actual circumstances. Since the ex had a different context than the coworker, the girlfriend's reaction isn't necessarily unfair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not addressing the situation properly and using the ex as a comparison.\n"
