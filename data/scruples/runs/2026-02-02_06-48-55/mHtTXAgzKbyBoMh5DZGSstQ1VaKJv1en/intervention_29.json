He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend (gf) who gets upset because the author is friends with a coworker, even though they've never dated. The author's gf, however, has an ex she still talks to, which the author didn't mind before. The author feels this is double standards and wants to confront his gf about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's gf was upset about him chatting with a coworker during lunch, but the author didn't mind her talking to her ex. The author is considering calling her out on the inconsistency. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but is now seeking an opinion.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The author's issue is about perceived double standards. His gf's ex is a past relationship, and they talk about non-romantic topics like mutual friends. The coworker is just a friend, and they've never even gone out. The author feels it's unfair that his gf can have a close friend (a former partner) while he can't have a work friend without being criticized. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the author is using this as a justification to confront his gf about her own behavior, maybe. But the problem is that the author's gf reacted strongly to his interaction with a coworker, which might be based on jealousy or insecurity. The author pointing out the inconsistency might be valid if the gf is being hypocritical. However, the author could also be using this as an excuse to bring up past issues where he didn't mind before, which might not be fair. \n\nBut the main issue is the author's response to being criticized. The author is not in the wrong if he is addressing a legitimate double standard. The gf's reaction to the coworker might be unwarranted, especially if there's no romantic intent. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the hypocrisy. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
