He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on his girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend's ex, who she talks to regularly, and a coworker the author is friends with.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has an ex who lives a few hours away. They communicate about mutual friends and things back home. The author isn't bothered by this. Then, the author is friends with coworker A, who's nice and they've been friends since starting the job. The author used to think she was cute but never made a move. They only have her number for work-related reasons and never met outside of work.\n\nThe conflict arises when the girlfriend sees them chatting and gets upset. The author then confronts her, pointing out the double standard. The user is asking if bringing this up is wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is the perceived double standard. The girlfriend is upset about the author's friendship with coworker A, but she continues to talk to her ex. The author is trying to highlight this inconsistency. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the nature of the relationships and the actions of both parties. The ex is someone the girlfriend was in a past romantic relationship with, and they still talk despite being separated by distance. The author's coworker is just a friend; there's no indication of romantic interest or action from the author. The author has the coworker's number only for work, hasn't asked her out, and they don't meet outside of work. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy or insecurity, even though there's no evidence of the author doing anything wrong. The author's response is to point out the inconsistency. In relationships, communication and understanding are important. If the girlfriend is okay with her ex, then the author's behavior should be okay too. However, if there was a prior agreement about such interactions, that could matter. But from the given info, there's no mention of boundaries set by the couple. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the double standard. The question is whether bringing it up is the right move, but in terms of being in the wrong, the author's actions (having a work-related friendship) don't violate any norms unless there's a specific rule in their relationship against it. The girlfriend's reaction might be irrational, but the author's response is about addressing the inconsistency. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
