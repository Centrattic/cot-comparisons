      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to, which the author doesn't mind. The ex lives a few hours away and they just chat about home, mutual friends, etc. Then there's a coworker named A who is a friend, and the author used to find her cute but never made a move. The only reason they have her number is for work. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got mad. The author then confronted her, pointing out the double standard with her ex. Now he's considering bringing it up again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's girlfriend is upset about him talking to a friendly coworker. The author feels it's unfair because his girlfriend can have a close ex-friend but he can't even have a work friend. The author is considering confronting her again about this inconsistency.\n\nThe main issue here is about perceived double standards in relationships. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, which is different from a current coworker. The distance of the ex (a few hours away) might mean they don't interact much, but the fact that they are exes could still be a sensitive point. The author's coworker is a friend he's known since work started, and he hasn't made any romantic moves on her. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity, even if the author isn't doing anything wrong.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate with the coworker; they're just colleagues. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from her own feelings, possibly projecting her own behavior with her ex onto the author. The author is pointing out a double standard, which is a valid concern. However, how he brings it up matters. If he's using it to manipulate or push back against her jealousy, that could be problematic. But if he's genuinely trying to address the inconsistency in their expectations, it's a reasonable approach.\n\nThe key factors are: 1) The author's actions are within the boundaries of a normal work relationship. 2) The girlfriend's ex is a different situation (past relationship vs. current colleague). 3) The author's confrontation is a response to her behavior, which might be unfair. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for pointing out inconsistencies. The girlfriend's jealousy might be the root issue here. The author isn't doing anything wrong by having a work friend. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). However, it's important to consider if the author is using this as a way to justify his own actions or provoke her. But based on the description, he's just calling out a double standard. So the answer is B.\n"
