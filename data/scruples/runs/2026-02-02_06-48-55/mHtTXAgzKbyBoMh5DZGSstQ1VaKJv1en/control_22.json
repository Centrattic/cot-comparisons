He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because he was chatting with a female coworker named A. The author mentions that A is just a friend, they've only ever met at work, and he's never made any moves on her. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has an ex she talks to regularly, and the author doesn't mind that. The problem arises when the girlfriend gets mad after seeing them chat during lunch, and the author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's girlfriend is upset about a work-related friendship with a female coworker. The author is pointing out that the girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't be friends with a coworker he's never dated. The author is questioning the fairness of this situation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider the context. The author hasn't done anything inappropriate with A\u2014no romantic or sexual advances, just work-related communication. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, and they live a few hours away, talking about mutual friends and home topics. The author doesn't mind her talking to the ex, but the situation is different because the ex was a past romantic partner, whereas A is just a coworker.\n\nThe author is highlighting a perceived inconsistency. The girlfriend is upset about a platonic relationship with a female coworker, while the author is okay with her having a past relationship's connection. The author wants to point out that the rules aren't being applied equally. \n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to address this? If the author is being fair and not engaging in any behavior that's similar to his girlfriend's ex situation, then pointing out the double standard might be justified. However, the way he does it matters. If he's using this to deflect from his own actions or not being considerate of her feelings, it could be problematic. But from the description, the author isn't doing anything inappropriate with A, so he has a valid point.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. Since he's not acting in a way that's similar to her ex situation (no romantic involvement), he's not being hypocritical. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for wanting to address the unfairness. The answer should be B.\n"
