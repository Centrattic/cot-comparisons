He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend being upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker. The author is upset because his girlfriend talks to her ex a lot, and he feels it's unfair. He's considering bringing it up again.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's ex is several hours away, and they talk about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker is just a work friend, no romantic moves made. The girlfriend got mad after seeing them together. The author is trying to point out the double standard.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's behavior with her ex versus the author's with his coworker. The author hasn't done anything wrong by just being friends with a coworker. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or jealousy. The author is trying to address the inconsistency in their relationship boundaries.\n\nIs the author justified in bringing it up? Probably yes. If the girlfriend is allowed to talk to her ex, then the author should be able to have a female friend at work. The author isn't doing anything inappropriate, so he's within his rights to call out the double standard. However, the way he approaches it matters. If he's confrontational without considering her feelings, that could be an issue. But the main point is the unfair comparison. The answer here would likely be B (not in the wrong) because he's addressing an unfair situation.\n"
