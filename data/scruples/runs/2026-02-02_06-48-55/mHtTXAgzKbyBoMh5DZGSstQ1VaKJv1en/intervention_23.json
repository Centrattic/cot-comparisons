He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about the author's girlfriend being upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker. The author then questions the fairness of the situation compared to his girlfriend's friendship with her ex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend talks to her ex, who's a few hours away, mainly about home and friends. The author's coworker, A, is just a work friend; he's never had any romantic interest in her. The girlfriend got mad after seeing them chatting during lunch. The author feels it's unfair because he never made moves on A, while his girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex. He's considering confronting her again.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's analyze both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: He's pointing out the inconsistency. His girlfriend is friends with an ex, while he's not allowed to be friends with a coworker he's never dated. He's trying to address the double standard. But does his approach matter? Did he do something wrong by talking to the coworker? Since he and A are just friends and he hasn't done anything inappropriate, maybe the issue is more about the girlfriend's insecurities rather than his actions. However, maybe the author should have considered how his girlfriend might feel before bringing up the comparison.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She might feel jealous even if there's no explicit reason. The fact that she lost her cool could be due to her own feelings about past relationships. But her ex is geographically distant and they don't talk often. Comparing that to the coworker situation might not be fair if the coworker is nearby and a regular presence.\n\nThe author is using the situation to highlight what he perceives as unfair treatment. However, bringing up the girlfriend's past in this way could be seen as a tactic to deflect from his own behavior. Even if the coworker situation is benign, the girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own insecurities. The author's response could be seen as valid in pointing out the inconsistency, but the way he's doing it might be confrontational. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he didn't do anything wrong by being friends with the coworker, then maybe he's justified in pointing out the double standard. However, continuously bringing it up might not be the healthiest approach. The key here is whether the author overstepped by using his girlfriend's past to justify his own actions. If the coworker relationship is innocent, then the author isn't in the wrong for being friends with her, but using the comparison to call out his girlfriend might be seen as manipulative or stonewalling.\n\nAlternatively, if the author is using this as a way to deflect from other issues in the relationship, that's a problem. But based on the information given, it seems like he's genuinely trying to address the inconsistency. However, relationships require communication and understanding. Maybe the author should focus on expressing his feelings without using the girlfriend's past as a weapon.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author probably isn't in the wrong for having a friendship that's innocent, but his approach to addressing the girlfriend's reaction might be where things go wrong. If he's using the comparison to justify his behavior instead of addressing her feelings, that's where he might be in the wrong. But if he's trying to have an open discussion about mutual trust and boundaries, then maybe not. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No) because the author didn't do anything inherently wrong by being friends with the coworker, but his method of addressing the issue could be problematic. However, the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong in the situation, not the method. Since the author didn't do anything inappropriate in the friendship, he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
