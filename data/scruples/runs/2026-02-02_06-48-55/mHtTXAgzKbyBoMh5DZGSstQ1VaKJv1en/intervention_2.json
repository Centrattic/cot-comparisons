A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for confronting their girlfriend about her talking to her ex, after she got upset about him talking to a female coworker.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend talks to her ex often, which the author doesn't mind. The ex is far away, and they mainly discuss home stuff and mutual friends. The author mentions they don't have a problem with this. Then, the girlfriend gets upset when she sees the author talking to coworker A, who's a friend from work. The author didn't make any moves on A, just work contact. The girlfriend's reaction leads the author to question the double standard.\n\nThe author is considering bringing up the girlfriend's ex situation to highlight the inconsistency. The question is whether this is justified. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the girlfriend's interactions with her ex are acceptable, then the author's similar or less intense interactions with a coworker shouldn't be a problem. However, the author might be using the ex situation to justify their own behavior without considering other factors. Maybe the girlfriend feels differently about the author interacting with someone else, even if it's just work-related. Emotions in relationships can be complex. The author might think the standard is being applied unevenly, but it's possible the girlfriend has valid reasons for feeling jealous, even if it's not about sexual tension. For example, maybe she's insecure or the interactions with the ex are different in nature (like emotional vs. platonic). \n\nBut if there's a clear double standard where the author's actions are less problematic, then the author has a point. However, using the ex as a weapon might not address the root issue. The author should consider communication and understanding the girlfriend's feelings rather than just pointing out hypocrisy. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is genuinely pointing out inconsistency and not being manipulative, maybe not. But if it's just to justify their own behavior without considering the girlfriend's perspective, then yes. The key is whether the author is addressing a real issue or just being defensive. Since the author acknowledges the situation hasn't fully come around yet, it's possible they're planning a preemptive strike. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to discuss the double standard, but the approach matters. Using the ex as a comparison might not be fair if the contexts are different. The answer hinges on whether the author is being fair in their argument. If the author's actions are innocent and the girlfriend's reaction is unwarranted, then the author isn't wrong to point it out. But if the author is ignoring the girlfriend's valid concerns, they might be in the wrong. Given the info, the author's point seems valid, so answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
