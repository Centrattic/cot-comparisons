A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her.

She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend relationship where the author's partner is upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker during lunch. The author is upset because his girlfriend talks to her ex often, and he's trying to turn the tables by pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which the author doesn't mind. Then, the author sees his girlfriend getting mad because she saw him talking to a coworker he's just friends with. The author is trying to bring up the inconsistency as a defense.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about jealousy and double standards. The girlfriend is jealous of the coworker, while the author is jealous of the ex. The question is whether the author is in the wrong when he points this out.\n\nI should think about communication and boundaries in relationships. In healthy relationships, both partners should feel comfortable discussing their feelings without being defensive. The author's action here is bringing up the girlfriend's behavior as a counterpoint. But is that fair?\n\nThe author's girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, but they live far apart and talk about mutual friends and hometown. The author's coworker is a friend he hasn't even asked out, and they only talk at work. So, the situations are different in terms of the nature of the relationships. The ex is a past romantic partner, while the coworker is just a friend. \n\nHowever, the author might be using the girlfriend's behavior to excuse his own actions. The girlfriend's jealousy could be irrational, but the author's response of bringing up her ex might be a way to justify his own actions. But is that the right approach? Maybe the author should address his own feelings of jealousy rather than pointing out the inconsistency as a justification. \n\nThere's also the aspect of how the author approached the situation. If he was trying to have an open conversation about boundaries and feelings, that's different than using it to call her out in a confrontational way. The way he brings it up matters. If he's doing it to be confrontational or to make her feel guilty, that could be the issue.\n\nAnother point is the frequency and context of the interactions. The girlfriend's ex is someone she can't avoid talking to because of mutual friends and hometown, whereas the author's coworker is someone he interacts with at work. The author might need to consider whether his actions could be misinterpreted, even if he has no romantic intent. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is pointing out a double standard. If the girlfriend is upset about his friendship with a coworker, but she has a continued relationship with her ex, it's a valid point. However, using that as an excuse might not address the underlying issues. The author should focus on his own boundaries and communication rather than just pointing out her behavior.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's using the girlfriend's behavior to justify his own actions without addressing his own feelings and communication, maybe he is. But if he's trying to have an open discussion about mutual expectations, then he's not. The key is whether he's being confrontational or seeking a solution. The initial question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning the tables. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the approach. If he's doing it in a way that's confrontational and not working towards a solution, he might be in the wrong. But if he's working on communication, then not. However, the situation seems to be that he's planning to call her out again, which might not be helpful. The right approach would be to discuss feelings without being confrontational. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he's using the girlfriend's behavior as an excuse rather than addressing his own feelings and communication. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Alternatively, if the girlfriend is indeed being inconsistent, then the author is not in the wrong for pointing it out. \n\nBut the main issue is that the author is trying to justify his actions because he's being criticized, which might not be the healthiest approach. Healthy communication should involve both parties discussing their feelings without deflection. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for using the girlfriend's behavior as a defense mechanism instead of addressing his own actions and feelings.\n"
