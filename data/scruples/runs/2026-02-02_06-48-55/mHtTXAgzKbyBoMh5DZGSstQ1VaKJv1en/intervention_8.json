      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who's upset because his girlfriend gets mad at him for talking to a female coworker, but she seems to have a friendly relationship with her ex. The guy wants to confront her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away and they talk mainly about home stuff and mutual friends. The author doesn't mind that. But when his girlfriend sees him having lunch with coworker A, who he's just friends with and never asked out, she gets angry. The author is upset because he feels it's a double standard\u2014she can be friends with an ex she's had a relationship with, but he can't be friends with a coworker he's never even dated.\n\nSo, the main issue here is perceived double standards in their relationship. The author is trying to highlight that inconsistency. The question is whether he's in the wrong for pointing this out.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is pointing out a situation where both parties are engaging in similar behavior (maintaining some level of contact with an ex or a colleague), but the repercussions are different. The girlfriend is upset about the coworker interaction, while the author is okay with her talking to her ex. The author feels it's unfair and wants to address it.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The ex is a past romantic partner, which might be a more sensitive area compared to a current coworker. Even if they don't see each other often, the ex's relationship with the girlfriend is different from a coworker. The girlfriend's jealousy might stem from past experiences or insecurity related to the ex. On the other hand, the author's interaction with the coworker is purely professional and platonic, as he states he's never made a move and only interacts for work.\n\nThe author's approach is to confront her about it. While it's valid to discuss double standards, the way he does it could come off as accusatory. Instead of addressing the issue calmly, he's using the phrase \"turning the tables,\" which might be seen as a tactic to provoke rather than resolve the conflict. The key here is whether the author's method of confrontation is appropriate, not just the content.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the coworker is someone he's never seen outside work and only has contact for work reasons. This suggests there's no romantic involvement. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own perceptions or insecurities, not necessarily the actual situation. The author's response could be seen as valid in pointing out the inconsistency, but he needs to approach it with empathy and understanding of her feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard. However, the way he's planning to do it might be problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for confronting her about it. If the confrontation is done in a respectful and constructive manner, it's not wrong. But if it's done in a way that's accusatory or dismissive of her feelings, it could be.\n\nGiven that the author is considering bringing it up again, the answer depends on the approach. The act of seeking to address a perceived unfairness isn't inherently wrong. However, the method and timing matter. If he's going to call her out, he should do it calmly and without judgment, focusing on his feelings rather than blaming her. The initial reaction of \"losing her shit\" might indicate that the girlfriend has valid reasons for her feelings, even if they're based on past experiences. The author needs to balance his right to be treated fairly with understanding her perspective.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to address the issue. The problem might lie in how he's approaching it. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
