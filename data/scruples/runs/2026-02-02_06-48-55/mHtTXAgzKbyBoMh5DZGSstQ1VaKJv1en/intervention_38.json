He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who's upset because the author was talking to a female coworker. The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly, and the author is pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's girlfriend is upset about him talking to a female coworker, even though he's just friends with her and hasn't made any moves. Meanwhile, the girlfriend has an ex she communicates with about home and mutual friends. The author is questioning the fairness of the situation, pointing out the double standard.\n\nNow, considering relationships and trust. In many relationships, there's an expectation of transparency and communication. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy or insecurity, especially if she feels the ex has a closer relationship. However, the author's situation with the coworker seems innocuous\u2014just work-related and platonic. \n\nThe author is bringing up the inconsistency, which is a valid point. If the girlfriend is okay with her ex but not with the author having a friend, that's a double standard. However, the author should also consider why the girlfriend is upset. Maybe there's a deeper issue here, like past trust problems or how the ex's presence in her life is affecting the current relationship.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's not doing anything inappropriate with the coworker, then his actions aren't wrong. The issue is the girlfriend's reaction. The author pointing out the inconsistency isn't necessarily wrong either. However, the way he's approaching it might be. Instead of turning the tables, maybe open communication is better. But the act of pointing out the inconsistency isn't inherently wrong if he's not being disrespectful.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being friends with the coworker. The girlfriend's jealousy is her issue, not his. The author is right to question the double standard. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
