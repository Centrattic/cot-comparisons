A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is in a relationship and their girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally. The author doesn't have a problem with that. Then there's a coworker named A, who the author has known for a while. The author used to think A was cute but hasn't made any moves. The contact is only work-related, and they haven't met outside of work. \n\nDuring a break, the girlfriend shows up and sees the author chatting with A at lunch. She gets really upset and is mad all day. The author then confronts her, pointing out the double standard since she's allowed to be friends with her ex but he can't even have a work friend. The author is considering bringing it up again and wants to know if they're in the wrong for calling her out.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the perceived double standard. The author's girlfriend is upset about him chatting with a female coworker, even though she's allowed to have a friendship with her ex. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair. \n\nNow, from a relationship dynamics perspective, trust and communication are crucial. The author's girlfriend might feel jealous or insecure when seeing her partner interact with another woman, even if it's just a coworker. On the other hand, the author is pointing out that his girlfriend's behavior (maintaining contact with her ex) isn't being treated equally. \n\nBut here's the thing: the nature of the relationships might be different. The ex is someone the girlfriend was in a past relationship with, which can be more sensitive. The coworker is just a friend, and the author hasn't made any moves. The girlfriend might feel that even casual interactions with a woman could be a trigger for her, depending on her insecurities. \n\nThe author's approach is to call her out on the double standard. However, in a relationship, it's important to address these feelings without being confrontational. The author could have handled it differently, maybe by discussing his feelings and concerns instead of pointing out the double standard immediately. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't do anything wrong by having a work-related friendship with a female coworker. The girlfriend's reaction is her own issue, perhaps stemming from jealousy. The author has a valid point about the double standard. However, the way he's considering addressing it (calling her out) might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything wrong by having a female coworker friend. The girlfriend's reaction is her own, and the author has every right to express his feelings. However, the method of confrontation is important. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, but maybe the approach could be more constructive. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author isn't at fault for having a work-related friendship and pointing out the double standard. The girlfriend's reaction is her own issue, and the author is justified in seeking to address the imbalance in the relationship dynamics.\n"
