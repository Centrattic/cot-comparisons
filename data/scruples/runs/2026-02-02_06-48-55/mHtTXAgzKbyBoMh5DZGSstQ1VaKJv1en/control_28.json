He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend being upset about him talking to a female coworker, while she herself talks to her ex. The author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which he doesn't mind. Then, his coworker A is a friend from work, and he's never had romantic feelings for her. The girlfriend got angry seeing them chatting during lunch. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair that his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't even be friends with a colleague.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's ex is a former romantic partner, and they talk about non-romantic stuff. The author's coworker is just a friend, no romantic history. The author hasn't made any moves on A and only has her number for work. So, the author is in a situation where he's being accused of something that's not really the case. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or jealousy. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which seems fair. However, the way he's considering \"turning the tables\" might come off as confrontational. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIf the author's actions were genuinely innocent and his girlfriend's reaction is based on unfair comparisons, then he's not in the wrong. The coworker isn't a romantic interest, and the ex is a past relationship. The key is whether the author's behavior crossed any boundaries. Since he's just working with A and has no romantic intentions, he's not at fault. The girlfriend's jealousy is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
