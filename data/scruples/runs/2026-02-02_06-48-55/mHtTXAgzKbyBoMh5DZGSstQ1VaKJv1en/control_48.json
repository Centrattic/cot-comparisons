A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy whose girlfriend is upset because he was chatting with a female coworker named A. The girlfriend sees him and gets angry, and then he's upset because she's friends with her ex, who she used to have a relationship with. He's considering bringing this up to her to point out the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girl's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with and still talks to about things like mutual friends and home. The guy's coworker, A, is someone he's just friends with for work. She didn't make any moves on A and only has her number for work. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting during lunch, and then the guy challenged her about the double standard.\n\nSo the question is whether the guy is in the wrong for calling her out. The main issue here is about perceived double standards in relationships. The girlfriend is friends with her ex, which might be a sensitive topic if the guy doesn't have a similar situation. However, the guy is friends with a coworker but hasn't done anything inappropriate. The key is whether the guy's actions (chatting with a coworker) are comparable to the girlfriend's (being friends with her ex).\n\nIn relationships, it's common for one partner to feel jealous or uncomfortable if the other is in contact with an ex, especially if there's a history of intimacy. However, if the current situation is that the girlfriend is already in a relationship with the author, then she might have unspoken expectations about his interactions with other people. The guy is pointing out that she's allowed to be friends with someone she had a past relationship with, while he's being criticized for a platonic work friendship. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as fair if there's a consistent standard. If the girlfriend isn't allowed to be friends with her ex, but the guy is okay with it, then he's not being hypocritical. But if the girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex but the guy is not allowed to be friends with a coworker (even if they're just friends), then the guy has a point. However, the fact that the ex actually had a relationship adds another layer. The guy's coworker is a non-issue in terms of past relationships, so the comparison might be valid.\n\nBut maybe the girlfriend's reaction was based on insecurity or fear, not just hypocrisy. It's also possible that the girlfriend is okay with her ex because they're not in close contact, while the guy's coworker is nearby and they interact daily. The guy's situation might be more sensitive because the coworker is part of his daily life, leading to more potential for jealousy. \n\nHowever, the author's main point is that he's just friends with a coworker and hasn't done anything wrong, while his girlfriend is friends with her ex. If the girlfriend's ex is not a problem, then the guy's behavior is similar. The key here is whether the author is being fair in his comparison. If the ex is a past relationship and the coworker is a current friend without romantic history, maybe the comparison is valid. But the context of the ex being a former partner might make the situations different. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is not in the wrong if he's maintaining a platonic relationship with a coworker and the girlfriend is being inconsistent. However, bringing up the double standard might be necessary for the relationship's health. The answer here depends on whether the author's actions (just being friends with a coworker) are indeed different from the girlfriend's (friends with her ex). If the author's actions are comparable but the girlfriend is being hypocritical, then he's not in the wrong. But if the situations are different, maybe he is. Since the ex had a past relationship, maybe the girlfriend's friendship is more sensitive. However, the author's situation is a current coworker, so maybe it's not the same. \n\nOverall, the author might not be in the wrong if he's just being friends with a coworker, and the girlfriend's reaction is based on jealousy rather than any actual wrongdoing. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
