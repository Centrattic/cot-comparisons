      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author is in a relationship where his girlfriend has an ex-boyfriend she still talks to. He doesn't mind that because they don't talk often and it's mostly about mutual friends or things back home. The author has a female coworker named A. He and A have been friends since he started working there, but he never made any romantic moves on her. He only has her number for work reasons and hasn't seen her outside of work.\n\nThen, the girlfriend shows up during his break and sees him chatting with A at lunch. She gets really upset and is mad at him for the rest of the day. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair that his girlfriend can have a friendship with her ex (who they used to have a sexual relationship with) but he can't even be friends with a coworker who he's never dated. He's considering bringing this up to her and is asking if he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's break down the elements. The key issue here is about perceived double standards in relationships. The author is upset because his girlfriend has an ongoing friendship with her ex, which includes talking about mutual friends and home stuff. He himself is being reprimanded for being friends with a coworker who he's never dated. He feels that his relationship is being policed more strictly than his girlfriend's.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, relationships are based on mutual respect and trust. If both partners agree on the boundaries of their relationships, then it's about maintaining those. However, in this case, it seems like the author is pointing out a discrepancy. His girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with her ex, while he is being criticized for being friends with a coworker who he has no romantic history with. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is perhaps based on jealousy or insecurity. She might be uncomfortable with the idea of her partner interacting with a female coworker, even if it's just a professional or friendly relationship. The author, on the other hand, is challenging that by pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nNow, the author is considering bringing this up. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so. If the girlfriend's boundaries are clear and agreed upon, then maybe the author should respect them. But if there's a double standard, then the author is justified in pointing it out. \n\nBut wait, the author also needs to consider why his girlfriend is upset. If she feels that the coworker situation is different because the coworker is a woman and there's potential for jealousy, even if there's no actual wrongdoing on the author's part, that's about her own insecurities. The author's responsibility is to communicate his side, but also to be respectful of her feelings. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to bring up the inconsistency. However, the way he approaches it matters. If he's being confrontational or accusatory, that could escalate the issue. However, if he's trying to have a constructive conversation about fairness, then it's a valid point. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is trying to address a perceived unfairness, which is understandable. Unless there are specific boundaries that the author has crossed that aren't similar to his girlfriend's situation with her ex, he might not be in the wrong. \n\nOne thing to note is that the author hasn't done anything wrong\u2014no infidelity or even any flirtation. He's just been friends with a coworker. His girlfriend's ex is also someone she's still in contact with, but that's considered okay. The author is highlighting that inconsistency, which is a fair point. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to call out the double standard. The answer would be B (No).\n"
