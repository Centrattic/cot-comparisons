He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. So the setup is that the author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, which he doesn't mind because they don't talk often and it's just about home stuff and friends. Then, the author's coworker, A, is just a work friend. The author has never made a move on her and only has her number for work. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got mad, leading the author to question why the girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex but he can't be friends with A.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, but they live a few hours away and don't talk much. The author isn't upset about that. However, when the author is friendly with a coworker who he's never had romantic intentions with, the girlfriend gets upset. The author is pointing out the double standard here.\n\nSo, the key points are: mutual friends with an ex vs. friendly coworkers. The author is highlighting the inconsistency. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy, even though there's no romantic interest from the author. The author is questioning why the girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with her ex, which is different from the author's situation with the coworker. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes one person might feel jealous even if there's no real threat. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friendly with a coworker, especially since there's no romantic interest. The girlfriend's ex is allowed to be a friend, so the author's situation seems similar in nature but different in context. The author's action of confronting the double standard is reasonable because it's about fairness. \n\nHowever, the author should consider how to approach this conversation without being confrontational. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the approach. Since the author hasn't done anything inappropriate\u2014maintaining a platonic friendship\u2014the answer would likely be that he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy is her issue, and the author is justified in pointing out the inconsistency. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
