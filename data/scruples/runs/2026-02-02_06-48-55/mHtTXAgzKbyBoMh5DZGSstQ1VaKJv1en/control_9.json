He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The author's girlfriend gets upset when she sees him talking to a female coworker, but the author doesn't mind the girlfriend talking to her ex. He's considering pointing out the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which he's okay with. The coworker (A) is just a friend from work, no romantic interest. The girlfriend got angry after seeing them chat, and the author is questioning the fairness of her reaction.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for wanting to highlight the inconsistency. The girlfriend's behavior seems hypocritical\u2014she's upset about his friendship with a coworker but allows her own friendship with an ex. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friendly with a coworker, especially since there's no romantic history. He's pointing out a double standard, which might be valid.\n\nBut I should check if there's any nuance. The ex lives a few hours away and they don't talk often, which is different from a coworker who's part of the author's daily life. The author's relationship with A is purely work-related, whereas the girlfriend's ex has a past romantic relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy, even if it's not justified.\n\nThe author's intention is to address the unfairness. If he approaches it calmly, he's not wrong for seeking fairness in the relationship. However, if he brings it up in a confrontational way, it could escalate things. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to call her out, not how he does it. Since the situation as described is about a double standard, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing it out. So the answer should be B.\n"
