      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend (gf) talking to her ex regularly, which he doesn't mind. The ex is a few hours away, and their conversations are about home, mutual friends, etc. The author has a female coworker (A) who he's been friends with since starting the job. He used to find her cute but never made a move. He only has her number for work reasons and hasn't seen her outside of work. \n\nThen, the gf came by during his break, saw him chatting with A, and got really mad. The author is upset because he believes it's unfair since his gf is friends with her ex, whom she used to be intimate with, but he can't even be friends with a coworker who he hasn't pursued. He's considering bringing this up to her.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know the community's take. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the fairness of the situation. The key points here are the girlfriend's jealousy and the author's reaction. The author's gf talks to her ex who is a past romantic partner, which can be a sensitive issue depending on the current relationship's boundaries. The author is in a position where he's friends with a coworker, which is common and often necessary for work relationships. However, the girlfriend's reaction is based on her perception of the relationship dynamic.\n\nThe author is arguing that if his gf can be friends with her ex, then he should be able to be friends with his coworker. But the difference here is that the ex was a romantic partner, which is a different level of intimacy compared to a platonic work friend. The author never had a romantic relationship with his coworker, so his friendship might be less triggering. However, the girlfriend's emotional response might not be about the past relationship but about the current situation she's witnessing.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Boundaries in Relationships**: The girlfriend might have unspoken boundaries about being friends with exes, which the author is now challenging. The fact that the ex lives far away and they don't talk often could be her way of managing her own boundaries, which the author is not respecting in his own actions.\n\n2. **Perception of the Author's Intentions**: The author's gf might feel that the friendship with A is inappropriate because the coworker is a woman. Even if there's no romantic history, the presence of a female coworker in a friendly setting can cause jealousy, especially if the author is male. The author might be projecting his own feelings of being treated unfairly, but the context of the relationships is different.\n\n3. **Communication and Trust**: The author's response to his gf's jealousy by bringing it up is a communication effort, which is good. But whether he's in the wrong depends on the actions. If he's genuinely just being a work friend and there's no romantic intent, then his actions are fine. But the girlfriend's reaction could be valid based on her own insecurities or past experiences.\n\n4. **Double Standards**: The author is pointing out a potential double standard. If the girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex, why not him with his coworker? However, the ex situation is different because they were in a romantic relationship, which can make casual friendships more complicated. The coworker is just a friend, so maybe the author is right to question the inconsistency.\n\n5. **Past Behavior vs. Current Actions**: The girlfriend's ex is part of her past, and maintaining a friendship there might be seen as a personal choice. The author's coworker is a present-day relationship. The girlfriend might not be comfortable with the idea of her partner being close to another woman, even platonically, which is a common issue in relationships.\n\nBut I should also consider if the author's actions are crossing any lines. If he's only interacting with the coworker for work-related reasons and hasn't done anything to suggest romantic interest, then he's in the right. However, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own feelings or past issues, not from the author's wrongdoing. \n\nThe author's argument is about fairness, but the situations aren't exactly parallel. The ex was a romantic partner, so the girlfriend might have different boundaries for her ex versus a work friend. The author should communicate his side, but whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his actions with A are within the agreed-upon boundaries of his relationship. If he's not doing anything inappropriate, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend feels betrayed, even if it's not justified, that's about her feelings, not necessarily his actions.\n\nSo the answer would depend on the context of their relationship boundaries. If the author has no romantic intentions and their friendship is appropriate, then he's not in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's boundaries are about any close friendships with the opposite sex, then the author might be in the wrong by not respecting that. However, the original question is whether he's in the wrong now. Since he hasn't done anything beyond a work-related friendship, and she's the one who saw it and reacted, he might not be in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
