He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their relationship situation. So, the author's girlfriend talks to her ex a lot, which he's okay with. But when the author is seen chatting with a female coworker, the girlfriend gets upset. The author is frustrated because he feels it's double standards.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The author mentions that he and the coworker are just friends, and he's never made any moves. The coworker is only known through work. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has an ex she talks to, which the author doesn't mind.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is the perceived double standard. He's pointing out that the girlfriend is okay with her ex but not with him talking to a coworker. The question is whether he's right to call her out. \n\nIn relationships, jealousy is common, but it's important that both partners feel respected. If the girlfriend is upset without a valid reason, that could be an issue. The author is trying to address the inconsistency, which is reasonable. However, how he approaches it matters. If he's confrontational, that might escalate things. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the approach.\n\nThe author didn't do anything inappropriate with the coworker, so he's not in the wrong there. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on her own insecurities. The author is asserting his right to have platonic friendships, which is valid. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. He's addressing a double standard, which is fair as long as his actions are appropriate.\n"
