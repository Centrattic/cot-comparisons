A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her.

She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for turning the tables on their girlfriend. The situation involves his girlfriend having an ex she talks to, which he's okay with. Then there's a coworker named A that the author is friends with. The girlfriend got mad when she saw them chatting, but the author is frustrated because he feels double standards here.\n\nSo, the main issue is about perceived double standards in relationships. The girlfriend is friends with an ex and talks to him about mutual friends and home stuff. The author, on the other hand, is friends with a coworker, who he's had a work-related friendship with for a while. The girlfriend gets upset, and the author is trying to point out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and trust. In a relationship, it's important that both partners feel comfortable and secure. The author mentions that the coworker is just a friend, and they've never had anything romantic. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not trust him or feels jealous, even if it's not justified.\n\nBut the author is trying to highlight the double standard. His girlfriend has an ex she's close to, yet she gets upset when he's friends with someone else. Maybe she's being inconsistent. But does that mean the author is right to call her out? Or is there a nuance here?\n\nThe author's approach is to confront her about it. Confrontation can sometimes be necessary for resolving misunderstandings, but how it's done matters. If he's accusing her without addressing his own behavior, it might come off as insincere. However, if he's been open about his friendship with A all along and she's now reacting without prior issues, then her reaction is the problem.\n\nAnother angle is that relationships involve mutual respect and understanding. If both partners are allowed to have friendships, regardless of gender, then the girlfriend's reaction is unfair. But if there's a history of trust issues or past problems, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is justified. The author doesn't mention any prior issues, so maybe the problem is her overreaction.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, he's not doing anything wrong by being friends with a coworker. The issue is the girlfriend's reaction. The author's decision to bring it up might be a way to address the inconsistency. However, how he approaches it could affect the outcome. If he does it calmly and respectfully, it's fair. If he's accusatory, it might backfire.\n\nUltimately, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for pointing out the double standard. Since the author isn't doing anything wrong (just maintaining a work friendship), and the girlfriend is reacting unfairly, the author's actions in addressing it could be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
