A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on his girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend talking to an ex, which the author doesn't mind, but when the author is seen chatting with a female coworker, the girlfriend gets upset. The author is upset because he feels there's a double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's ex is a guy she talks to occasionally about mutual friends and home stuff. The author has a female coworker, A, who he's friends with for work reasons, never asked her out, and never seen outside work. The girlfriend saw them chatting and got angry. The author is upset because he thinks it's unfair since his girlfriend can have a past relationship contact but he can't even have a female coworker friend. He's considering bringing it up.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of relationships. Jealousy and double standards can be tricky here. The girlfriend's ex is from the past, they don't talk often, and it's about non-romantic topics. The author's coworker is a current, platonic friend. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity, even if it's irrational. The author's action was to confront her about the perceived double standard.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's being honest and there's a real inconsistency in how they're treating each other's social interactions, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the author's actions were confrontational or dismissive of his girlfriend's feelings, that could be an issue. The key is whether the author's behavior (just having a coworker friend) is comparable to the girlfriend's (talking to an ex). Since the author has done nothing romantic with A, while the girlfriend is still in contact with a past partner, the author has a valid point. However, the way he brings it up matters. Confrontation without understanding her perspective might not help. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the method of communication. Since the author isn't doing anything wrong (just having a friend), he's not in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. So the answer is B."
