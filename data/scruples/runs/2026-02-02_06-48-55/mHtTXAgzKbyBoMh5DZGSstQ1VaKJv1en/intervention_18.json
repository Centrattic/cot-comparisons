He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The key points are:\n\n1. The girlfriend talks to her ex, which the author is okay with. They mention it's not a big deal since the ex lives a few hours away and they talk about non-romantic topics.\n2. The author has a female coworker, A, who they've been friends with since starting work. The author used to think A was cute but never made moves and only has her number for work. They haven't seen her outside work.\n3. The girlfriend sees the author chatting with A during lunch and gets angry. The author confronts her about the double standard, pointing out that she's allowed to talk to her ex but he's not allowed to talk to a coworker he never asked out.\n\nThe author is considering bringing up the double standard again. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but we need to determine if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's ex situation: if they're just talking about mutual friends and home topics, it's likely platonic. The author isn't objecting to that, so there's no issue there.\n\nRegarding the coworker, the author has a work-related reason to have her number and they're just friends. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy or insecurity, even though there's no indication of the author pursuing anything with the coworker. The author is pointing out the double standard, which could be valid. However, confronting the girlfriend in a way that escalates the situation might be problematic.\n\nThe author's approach here is to call out the girlfriend's behavior. But if the author's actions (chatting with a coworker) aren't crossing any boundaries they've set, then the girlfriend's reaction is the issue, not the author's. However, the author might be using this as a way to justify their own behavior without considering the girlfriend's feelings. The key is whether the author has communicated their boundaries clearly. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable and the author hasn't discussed this before, it's possible the author didn't set clear expectations. However, if the author's actions are within acceptable boundaries and the girlfriend is being inconsistent, the author might be right to address it.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author's actions are innocent and the girlfriend is overreacting, then the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. However, the way they confront the issue could affect the relationship. The answer depends on whether the author's behavior was indeed within the agreed-upon boundaries. Since the author mentions they never made moves on A and only have her number for work, they likely aren't in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her own insecurities, not the author's actual actions. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for addressing the double standard.\n"
