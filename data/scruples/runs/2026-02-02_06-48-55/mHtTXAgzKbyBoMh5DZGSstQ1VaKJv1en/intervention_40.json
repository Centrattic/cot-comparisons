He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about their girlfriend having an ex she talks to regularly, and the author being upset when their girlfriend gets mad at them for talking to a female coworker. The author is considering bringing up the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, and they talk about things like home, mutual friends, etc. The author doesn't mind the contact but is upset when their girlfriend reacts negatively to them talking to a female coworker. The key point is the perceived double standard: the girlfriend is allowed to have a past relationship, but the author is being judged for talking to a colleague.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the girlfriend can be friends with her ex, he should be allowed to be friends with his coworker. However, there might be nuances. For example, the ex and the coworker have different contexts. The ex is in the past, possibly more distant, while the coworker is part of the author's current life. The girlfriend's reaction could be based on insecurity or jealousy, even if the coworker isn't a romantic interest.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author is pointing out a potential inconsistency. If the girlfriend is allowed to maintain a connection with her ex, then the author might feel it's unfair that their similar behavior is being criticized. However, the author should also consider the nature of the relationships. The ex is a past partner, and boundaries in such situations can vary. The coworker, even if just a friend, might be more immediate and present in the author's daily life, which could trigger the girlfriend's jealousy differently.\n\nThe author's action of bringing it up could be a way to address the double standard. But is it right to do so? It depends on communication. If the author brings it up calmly and respectfully, it might help the relationship by addressing underlying issues. However, if it's done in the heat of the moment or as a way to retaliate, it could escalate things.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong for noticing a potential double standard. However, their approach matters. If they're using the situation to justify their own behavior without considering the girlfriend's feelings, that could be problematic. The girlfriend's jealousy might stem from valid insecurities, even if the author's interaction with the coworker is innocent. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author is using the ex situation as a justification without understanding the different contexts. If the author is in a committed relationship and the girlfriend's jealousy is based on the nature of the ex's relationship, then the author's behavior might be within bounds, but the way they handle the conflict is key. Ultimately, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, but the situation's resolution depends on mutual understanding and communication."
