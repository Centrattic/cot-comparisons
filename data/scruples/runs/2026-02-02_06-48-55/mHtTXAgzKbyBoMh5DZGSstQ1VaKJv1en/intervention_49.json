      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for turning the tables on their girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being upset about him talking to a female coworker, while she talks to her ex regularly. The author is considering pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's ex is a few hours away, they talk occasionally about mutual topics. The author's coworker is just a work friend, no romantic interest, and they only interact at work. The girlfriend got upset seeing them together, leading the author to question the double standard.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and communication in a relationship. The author is pointing out an inconsistency, which is fair to some extent. However, the way he handled it might matter. If he's using this as leverage or to accuse her without addressing his own potential issues, it could be problematic. But if he's genuinely trying to communicate his feelings, it's important.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions he never asked the coworker out and only interacts with her for work. The girlfriend's ex, on the other hand, was in a past relationship. So maybe the author's concern is valid. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own insecurities or past experiences. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for bringing up the double standard. The answer depends on intent and approach. If he's doing it in a hurtful or manipulative way, then he might be at fault. But if he's calmly addressing the inconsistency, it's a valid conversation to have. However, the initial situation is about the author using the girlfriend's past to justify his actions. That could be seen as a bit of a deflection. Maybe he should have addressed his own feelings of jealousy instead of pointing out her behavior as a reason. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is considering bringing it up again suggests that there might not have been a resolution yet. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with his interactions with the coworker, even if they're innocent, communication is key. The author might need to reassure his girlfriend rather than just pointing out her inconsistency. \n\nSo, in terms of wrongdoing, the author might be at fault if he's using this to deflect from his own need to address his girlfriend's concerns rather than just pointing out the inconsistency. It's possible that he's not entirely wrong, but there's a part where he could be more considerate in how he approaches the situation. However, pointing out a double standard isn't inherently wrong. The answer might be a bit nuanced, but since the user is asking for a yes or no (A/B), I need to decide based on the given info. \n\nConsidering that the author is using the girlfriend's past to justify his current behavior, which might not be fair. The girlfriend's reaction could be based on her feelings, even if the situation is different. So by bringing up the ex, the author might be invalidating her feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not addressing his girlfriend's emotions but instead pointing out her behavior as the issue.\n"
