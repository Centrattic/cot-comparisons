He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker during lunch. The author points out that his girlfriend still talks to her ex, which he didn't mind before. Now he's considering confronting her about it because he feels it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be with, and they talk about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker is just a friend from work, and he never made a move on her. The girlfriend got upset seeing them together, which the author finds hypocritical given her own situation with her ex.\n\nThe key issue here is about fairness and trust. The author isn't in a relationship with the coworker and hasn't done anything inappropriate. His girlfriend, however, is in a current relationship, yet she's maintaining contact with her ex. That seems like a potential issue because ex-partner communication can sometimes be a red flag in a new relationship.\n\nThe author's reaction is to point out the hypocrisy. Is it fair for him to do that? Well, he's not in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard. If his girlfriend is upset about his friendship with a coworker who's not a romantic interest, yet she's allowed her ex to be in her life, that's an inconsistency. The author isn't engaging in any behavior that's similar to her ex situation. His coworker isn't a romantic partner, and he hasn't acted on any feelings.\n\nHowever, the way he confronts her might matter. If he's doing it in a respectful and calm manner, then it's valid to discuss the imbalance. But if he's using it as a weapon or being confrontational, that could be the wrong approach. The question is about being in the wrong, not the method of confrontation. Since the author is pointing out a genuine issue of hypocrisy, he's not the one at fault. The real issue is the girlfriend's continued contact with her ex, which might need addressing on her part.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to bring up a fair point about the double standard in their relationship. The problem lies with the girlfriend's actions, not his.\n"
