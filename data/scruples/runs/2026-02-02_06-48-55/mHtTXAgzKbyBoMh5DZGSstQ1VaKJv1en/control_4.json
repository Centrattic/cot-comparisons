He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author is a guy in a relationship. His girlfriend talks to her ex regularly, which he doesn't mind. The ex lives a few hours away, and they mostly talk about mutual friends and hometown stuff. Then there's this coworker, A, who's been a friend since he started working there. The author used to think she was cute but never approached her. They only interact at work, and he has her number for work reasons.\n\nThe girlfriend came by during a break, saw them chatting, and got really mad. The author felt it was unfair because she's allowed to be friends with her ex, but he can't even be friends with a girl he's never dated. He's considering pointing this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about perceived double standards. The author is upset about the girlfriend's reaction to his friendship with coworker A, while she's allowed to have a close relationship with her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did anything wrong. The coworker is a friend, they only interact at work, and he hasn't had any romantic feelings for her. The girlfriend's ex, on the other hand, was someone she was in a relationship with. So maybe the girlfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's. \n\nBut wait, sometimes people feel insecure about their partner's exes or other friends. The author's girlfriend might be jealous or have trust issues. However, the author is pointing out a double standard. If the girlfriend is allowed to maintain a relationship with her ex, why is it a problem for him to be friends with his coworker? \n\nThe author hasn't done anything inappropriate. He and coworker A are just friends, and there's no indication of any romantic interest. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from her own jealousy rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong here. The issue lies more with the girlfriend's reaction and the double standard she's applying. The author is trying to address the unfairness, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
