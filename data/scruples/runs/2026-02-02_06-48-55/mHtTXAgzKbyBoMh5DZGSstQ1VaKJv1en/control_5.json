He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who talks to her ex, and the user, who has a female coworker, is being accused of inappropriate behavior after being seen chatting with her. The user is considering confronting the girlfriend about the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The girlfriend talks to her ex, which the user doesn't mind. The ex is not nearby, and their conversations are about mutual friends and hometown stuff. On the other hand, the user's coworker A is only known at work, and they have a friendly relationship, but there's no romantic involvement. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting during lunch, which led to a conflict.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user is pointing out that he has a platonic friendship with a female coworker, while his girlfriend is allowed to have a friendship with her ex. The user is questioning why there's a double standard here. \n\nIn relationships, jealousy and perceived double standards are common. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from past issues with the ex. If the ex is someone she was intimate with, even if it's platonic now, some people might feel uncomfortable because of the history. However, the user's situation with his coworker is purely professional, with no romantic advances. \n\nThe user isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining a work-related friendship. It's reasonable to want to discuss this with his girlfriend to address the inconsistency. However, confronting her might escalate the situation. Whether he's in the wrong depends on intent and actions. Since there's no evidence of the user overstepping in his friendship with A, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is the issue here. The correct answer should be B (No).\n"
