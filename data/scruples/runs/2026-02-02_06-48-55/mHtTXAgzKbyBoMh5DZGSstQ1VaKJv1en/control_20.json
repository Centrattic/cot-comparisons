He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when they confronted their girlfriend about her jealousy regarding her ex. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, mainly about mutual friends and hometown stuff. The author has a coworker, A, who's just a friendly work colleague. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting during lunch, even though the author hasn't done anything inappropriate.\n\nThe author is upset because their girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with an ex but feels restricted from being friends with a coworker. They want to address this double standard. \n\nNow, in terms of right and wrong, the key points are boundaries in relationships. Both partners should have mutual respect and understanding about what's acceptable. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friendly at work, especially since there's no romantic intent. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on insecurity or past experiences. \n\nThe author's confrontation is about addressing a perceived inconsistency. As long as the author isn't being unfaithful, they aren't in the wrong. The issue lies in communication and setting clear boundaries together. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
