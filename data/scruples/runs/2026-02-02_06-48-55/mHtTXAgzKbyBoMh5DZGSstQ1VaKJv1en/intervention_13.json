He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend being upset about him chatting with a female coworker, while she's allowed to talk to her ex. The author is considering bringing up the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away and they talk occasionally about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker, A, is just a friend for work reasons, and he's never asked her out or seen her outside work. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting, and the author is now questioning the fairness of her reaction.\n\nThe author's main argument is about the double standard: he's not allowed to be friends with a female coworker even though he hasn't done anything, while the girlfriend can remain friends with an ex. The question is whether this makes the author in the wrong for bringing it up.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is pointing out an inconsistency. If the girlfriend's ex is a past relationship and they talk occasionally, but the author's coworker is a current, innocent friendship, then the girlfriend's reaction seems unfair. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining a work-related friendship. The girlfriend's jealousy might be unfounded here.\n\nHowever, the author's approach could be problematic if he's using this as a way to retaliate or not addressing the root of her feelings. But the key here is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard. Since the coworker friendship is legitimate and the ex is a past relationship, the author's action of pointing out the inconsistency might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author should consider the girlfriend's feelings. Maybe her discomfort isn't just about the ex but about the current relationship. If the author is bringing it up to confront rather than to understand, that could be an issue. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether his approach is the best.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the double standard, as his actions are based on fairness and addressing an inconsistency. The answer should be B (No).\n"
