He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker. The author then questions the fairness of the girlfriend's reaction, pointing out that she's friends with an ex, but he can't even have a platonic friendship with a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's ex is someone she talks to occasionally about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker is just a friend from work; he never had romantic feelings for her. The girlfriend got mad after seeing them chat during lunch. The author is now considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about possible angles. Jealousy in relationships can be tricky. If the author's actions were innocent\u2014just work-related friendship and chatting during lunch\u2014then the girlfriend's reaction might be unfair. However, sometimes even innocent interactions can cause jealousy. The author is pointing out a perceived inconsistency: his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't have a friendship with a coworker.\n\nBut wait, the ex is from the past, and they don't talk often. The coworker is a current friend. The girlfriend's jealousy might stem from insecurity. The author's action of confronting her might be valid if he's pointing out an unfair double standard, but maybe he needs to approach it calmly. However, if he's using this as an excuse to justify his own actions, even if they're innocent, that could be problematic.\n\nThe author mentions he never asked the coworker out, so there's no romantic intent. The girlfriend's reaction might be disproportionate. However, in relationships, perceptions matter. Even if the author's actions are innocent, if his girlfriend feels threatened, that's an issue they need to address. The author's plan to call her out could help resolve the underlying issue, but the way he does it matters. If he's confrontational, it might escalate things. But if he brings it up calmly to discuss the double standard, it's reasonable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's acting in good faith and his actions were genuinely innocent, then maybe not. The problem might be the girlfriend's insecurity rather than the author's behavior. However, if the author is using this as an excuse to justify actions that could be seen as crossing boundaries, even if unintentionally, then he might be in the wrong. But based on the info given, the author's actions seem legitimate. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
