He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their actions in the given situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, and the author doesn't mind that. The ex lives a few hours away, and their conversations are about mutual friends and hometown stuff. The author's issue arises when his girlfriend gets upset because she saw him talking to a coworker named A during lunch. The girlfriend then gets angry, and the author feels it's unfair because she's allowed to be friends with her ex, while he's not allowed to be friends with a coworker he's never even asked out.\n\nThe key points here are about consistency in relationship expectations. The author is pointing out a perceived double standard. His girlfriend's ex is someone she had a past relationship with, and they maintain contact, which he's okay with. Meanwhile, he's friends with a coworker who he's never pursued romantically. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on jealousy or insecurity, but the author is questioning why her friendship with her ex is acceptable when his friendship with a coworker isn't.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author hasn't done anything inappropriate. He's maintaining a professional relationship with a coworker, and there's no indication of any romantic interest or action on his part. The girlfriend's ex, however, is someone she's had a past relationship with, which might naturally cause more sensitivity. The author is trying to address the inconsistency in how their respective relationships with their exes and coworkers are being treated.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about communication and setting boundaries in a relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. He's addressing a valid point about fairness. However, how he approaches it matters. If he's calm and constructive, he's more likely to resolve the issue. The question is whether he's in the wrong for bringing it up, which isn't the case. The girlfriend's jealousy is her own issue, and the author is just highlighting the unfair comparison.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's raising a legitimate concern about inconsistent treatment in the relationship, which is a valid point to discuss with his partner.\n"
