A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is upset because her partner is friends with a guy she used to date, but she's upset when the author is friends with a coworker. The author is considering confronting her about the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The key issue seems to be jealousy and perceived double standards. The girlfriend is talking to her ex, who lives a few hours away and they don't talk often, mainly about non-romantic topics. The author, on the other hand, is friends with a coworker, who he's never asked out and has only met at work. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting, and the author is upset because he feels he's being treated unfairly.\n\nHmm, so the girlfriend's ex is a past romantic partner, which can be a sensitive area. Even if they're just friends now, the fact that the ex is a former lover might make the current partner more jealous. The author's friend is someone he's never had romantic feelings for and hasn't even seen outside of work. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on past experiences or insecurities. \n\nBut the author is pointing out the inconsistency: why is it okay for her to have a close relationship with an ex but not with his coworker? That's a valid point. However, the context matters. An ex-boyfriend and a coworker are different in terms of potential for romantic involvement. The ex might carry emotional weight that a coworker doesn't. The author says he never even asked the coworker out, so the friendship is presumably platonic. The girlfriend might feel threatened by the ex because of their history, even if they're not dating now.\n\nBut the author's response was to confront her after an argument, which might not have been the best approach. Confronting someone during or immediately after a conflict can escalate things. The author is considering bringing it up again, which might not resolve the issue if it's rooted in deeper insecurities rather than the specific incident. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he's pointing out a double standard. On the other, maybe he's not considering her feelings. If the girlfriend's jealousy is based on past issues, the author's approach might be dismissive of her emotions. But the fact that he's friends with a coworker and she's friends with an ex is a valid point. However, the way he's handling it\u2014possibly bringing it up again after a fight\u2014might be unhelpful. \n\nI think the author's actions aren't necessarily in the wrong, but his approach to addressing the issue could be problematic. The core issue is about communication and understanding each other's feelings rather than just pointing out inconsistencies. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not doing anything that's inherently wrong (maintaining a platonic friendship) and is trying to address a perceived unfairness, maybe he's not in the wrong. But his method of confronting her might not be the best. However, the options are only A or B. Given that, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's not doing anything wrong, but the situation is more about communication and trust rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
