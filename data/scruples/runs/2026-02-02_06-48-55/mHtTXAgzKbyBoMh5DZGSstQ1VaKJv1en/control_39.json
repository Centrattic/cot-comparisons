He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, which he's okay with. But when the author is seen chatting with a female coworker, the girlfriend gets really mad. The author then questions why the girlfriend can be friends with her ex but he can't have a female friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to have a romantic relationship with, and they talk about things like mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker, on the other hand, is just a work friend. The author hasn't even seen her outside of work and only has her number for work reasons. \n\nThe key issue here is about jealousy and perceived double standards. The girlfriend is upset because the author is talking to a female coworker during lunch, which might be a sensitive time if they are in a public or semi-public place like a workplace cafeteria. Even if the coworker is just a friend, the girlfriend might feel insecure or threatened by the interaction. \n\nThe author is pointing out the inconsistency: his girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with an ex, which could imply some level of continued connection, while he's being reprimanded for a platonic friendship with a coworker. The author's reasoning is that the ex isn't a current threat, but the coworker isn't a threat either since they haven't even gone out. \n\nBut then, relationships often involve trust and communication. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own insecurities or past experiences. The author's response is to challenge her, which could be a valid way to address the double standard. However, the way he approached it\u2014by \"turning the tables\"\u2014might come off as confrontational or dismissive of her feelings, which could escalate the conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything wrong by just having a work-related friendship. The problem arises in how he handled the situation. If he's bringing up the ex to highlight her inconsistency, that's a valid point, but doing so without considering her feelings might not be the best approach. The wrong here isn't necessarily on either party, but rather in the communication. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out a double standard, but maybe he should approach it more sensitively. \n\nThe answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong because there's a legitimate issue with the double standard. However, the way he handles it matters. But based on the question, it's just about whether he's in the wrong, not the approach. So B is correct.\n"
