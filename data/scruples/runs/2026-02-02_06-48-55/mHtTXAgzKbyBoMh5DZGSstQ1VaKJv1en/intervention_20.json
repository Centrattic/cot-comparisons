He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for his actions. The scenario involves a girlfriend who talks to her ex, and the author being friends with a female coworker. The key points to consider are:\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's ex: the author states that he doesn't mind they talk since he's a few hours away and they discuss things like mutual friends and home. That seems like a normal, non-threatening relationship.\n\nNow, the author's side: he has a female coworker (A) who has been a friend since he started there. He used to find her cute but never made a move. They only interact at work and have her number for work reasons. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting during lunch, which led to the author questioning the double standard.\n\nThe author is considering bringing up the comparison between his girlfriend's interactions with her ex and his interactions with the coworker. The main issue here is about perceived double standards in relationships. The girlfriend is upset about the author's friendship, while she herself talks to her ex. The author feels it's unfair and wants to address it.\n\nNow, to evaluate who's in the wrong. In relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity, even if there's no concrete threat. The author, on the other hand, is pointing out a potential inconsistency. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014using a confrontation to highlight her behavior\u2014might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation.\n\nThe author's actions: he's being upfront about his feelings. However, bringing up the comparison in a confrontational manner could escalate the conflict. The key here is whether the author actually did something wrong. He was just chatting with a female coworker, something common in workplaces. The girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, which might carry different connotations.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the author and his girlfriend had established boundaries beforehand (like not talking to exes or coworkers), then breaking those would be an issue. But since the author's coworker isn't a threat and the ex is a past relationship, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the way he's choosing to address the issue\u2014by turning the tables\u2014might not be the best approach. He's valid in pointing out the inconsistency, but how he does it matters.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for his actions. Since he didn't do anything inherently wrong (just work-related chatting) and the girlfriend's reaction is based on her own insecurities, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). However, the approach to address the issue could be improved. The key is that the author isn't at fault for the situation, but he should handle the communication better.\n"
