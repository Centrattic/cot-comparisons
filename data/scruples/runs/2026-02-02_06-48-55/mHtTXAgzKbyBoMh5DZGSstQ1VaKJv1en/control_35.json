He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who's upset because his girlfriend gets angry when he's talking to a female coworker. The girlfriend is friends with her ex, which he's okay with, but when he's just being friendly with a coworker, she gets mad. He's considering pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The girlfriend's ex is someone she talks to occasionally about mutual friends and home stuff. The guy's coworker, A, is someone he's known for a while, just work friends. He used to think she was cute but hasn't made a move and only has her number for work. The girlfriend saw them chatting and got upset. The guy feels it's unfair because his girlfriend has a close ex but he can't even be friends with a coworker.\n\nSo the main issue is about perceived double standards. The guy is upset that his girlfriend can be friends with an ex but he can't be friends with a coworker he's not interested in. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to call her out on this.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend might feel that talking to a female coworker, even if just friends, could be a potential issue. Maybe she's worried about her boyfriend's attention or possible future feelings. On the other hand, the guy's frustration is about the inconsistency. If the girlfriend is okay with her ex but not his coworker, that might be a problem.\n\nBut is the guy in the wrong? Well, he's not doing anything wrong by being friends with a coworker. There's no indication he's doing anything inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or past experiences. The guy's response is pointing out the double standard, which is about fairness in the relationship. However, how he chooses to bring it up matters. If he's confrontational, it might escalate the issue. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to address it.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel comfortable and respected. If the girlfriend is okay with her ex but not his coworker, maybe there's an underlying issue she needs to address. The guy pointing out the inconsistency isn't necessarily wrong; it's about communication. However, he should consider her feelings and maybe approach it with understanding rather than being accusatory.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's not doing anything wrong by wanting to address a perceived double standard. The issue is more about the girlfriend's reaction and how they communicate, not the author's actions.\n"
