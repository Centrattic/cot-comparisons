He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who gets upset because her partner is friends with a female coworker, even though he's never asked her out. The author mentions that his girlfriend talks to her ex a lot, which he doesn't mind, but when he points out the inconsistency, she gets mad. He's considering bringing it up again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's main argument is about fairness: his girlfriend is allowed to have a close relationship with an ex, but he isn't allowed to have a close relationship with someone he's not dating. The issue here might be about jealousy and perceived double standards.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction to seeing him with coworker A could stem from insecurity or past issues. However, the author's response\u2014pointing out the inconsistency\u2014might be seen as confrontational or using her ex as a reason to justify his own behavior. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for bringing up the ex? Well, if the girlfriend's ex is a known issue, the author might be using it as a way to deflect his own potential jealousy. But maybe he's also valid in pointing out an unfair double standard. However, the way he's approaching it (calling her out) might not be constructive. The question is whether he's in the wrong for the situation as presented. \n\nThe author's actions (chatting with a coworker) aren't necessarily wrong unless there's a violation of agreed boundaries. If the girlfriend was upset without a valid reason, maybe she's being unfair. But the author's response might be more in the wrong because using her ex as a comparison could be seen as manipulative. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions crossed any boundaries. Since he's not dating coworker A and it's for work reasons, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, confronting her in that way could be problematic. But the question is about being in the wrong in the situation. So the initial action (chatting with coworker A) isn't wrong, but the way he's addressing the girlfriend's reaction might be. \n\nThe answer options are A (yes he's wrong) or B (no). Given the context, the author isn't in the wrong for having a work friend, but his approach in confronting her might be. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for turning the tables. If the girlfriend was being unfair, then he's not wrong. But if his method was inappropriate, then maybe A. But I think the main issue is the comparison. Using her ex as a reason to justify his behavior could be the wrong move. So maybe A. But I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, if the girlfriend was being inconsistent, then the author isn't wrong. Hmm. \n\nI think the key is that the author isn't violating any agreement, but his response might be the problem. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for the situation. Since he didn't do anything wrong but is responding to her jealousy, maybe he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
