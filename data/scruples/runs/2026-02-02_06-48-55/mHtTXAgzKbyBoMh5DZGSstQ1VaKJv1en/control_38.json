He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the provided text is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who's upset about the author chatting with a female coworker, while she herself talks to an ex-boyfriend regularly. The author is considering confronting her about the perceived double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away, and their conversations are about home, mutual friends, etc., which the author doesn't mind. However, the author's coworker, A, is a female friend he's known since starting work. He used to find her cute but never asked her out, and only has her number for work reasons. The girlfriend saw them chatting and got upset, leading to the author questioning the fairness of the situation.\n\nNow, considering the double standard. The author is pointing out that the girlfriend can be friends with an ex she's intimate with, but he can't have a regular female coworker friend. The ex situation is different because there's a history of a romantic relationship, which might make it more sensitive. The coworker is just a friend, no romantic history. The author hasn't even made any romantic moves on A, so the relationship is strictly professional and platonic.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend's reaction seems based on her own insecurities or discomfort, not on the author's actions. The author isn't doing anything harmful or inappropriate here. He's maintaining a work-related friendship, which is normal. The fact that his coworker is a woman who he once found cute but never acted on doesn't make their friendship wrong. The girlfriend's behavior is questionable because she's upset over a platonic relationship that's not moving beyond work, whereas her own friendship with an ex is more intense. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The problem lies in the girlfriend's jealousy or lack of boundaries, not the author's actions. The author is justified in feeling that it's unfair and considering addressing it. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
