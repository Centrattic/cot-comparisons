He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who gets upset because she saw the author talking to a female coworker. The author then compares this to his girlfriend's ex, who she still talks to. The author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's ex is someone they talk to occasionally about home and friends, and they don't see each other much. The coworker, A, is a friend from work, and the author hasn't made any romantic advances. The girlfriend got upset after seeing them chat during lunch. The author is upset because he feels it's a double standard\u2014his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't have a friendly work relationship with a colleague.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the double standard. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend's friendship with her ex is more than just occasional, while his interaction with the coworker is just work-related. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or past experiences. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to address a perceived unfairness. He hasn't done anything inappropriate\u2014no advances towards the coworker. The girlfriend's reaction might be irrational, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong to point it out. However, bringing it up in a confrontational way could be problematic. The author should consider communication and understanding her perspective before turning the tables. \n\nBut does that mean he's in the wrong? If he's being honest about his feelings and the situation, maybe not. However, if he's trying to use it as a way to justify his own actions without considering her feelings, then maybe. The key is whether the author is being respectful and trying to understand her perspective rather than just pointing out her faults. \n\nIn this case, the author is highlighting a real issue\u2014double standards in relationships. People often project their own insecurities, so if the girlfriend is uncomfortable with her ex, maybe she's not in the right. But the author should approach it with empathy. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the inconsistency, but how he does it matters. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong in general, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's addressing a valid concern, but he needs to handle it carefully.\n"
