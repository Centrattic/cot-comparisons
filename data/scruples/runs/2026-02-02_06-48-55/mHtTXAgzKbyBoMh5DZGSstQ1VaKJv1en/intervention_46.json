A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, which he doesn't mind, but when he chats with a friendly coworker, the girlfriend gets upset. The author is considering pointing out the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away and they talk mainly about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker (A) is someone he's known since starting the job, he used to think she was cute but didn't make a move, and they only interact at work. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got mad. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair that his girlfriend can be friends with an ex but he can't even be friends with a coworker who isn't a romantic interest.\n\nThe author's main argument is about the double standard. He's pointing out that his girlfriend's friendship with her ex is allowed, but his friendship with a colleague isn't. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for bringing this up.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel jealous or insecure about the coworker, even though they're just friends. Jealousy can be irrational, but it's a common issue in relationships. The author's coworker is a work colleague, not a romantic interest, so the author's point about not making a move is valid. However, the girlfriend's ex is a past romantic partner, which might be a different dynamic. The author is trying to highlight the inconsistency in her behavior.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, it's important for both partners to feel secure and respected. If the girlfriend is showing jealousy without a valid reason, that's an issue. But the author's response is to call her out on the double standard. Is that fair?\n\nThe author is not in the wrong if the coworker is genuinely just a friend and there's no romantic history. He's addressing a perceived unfairness in the relationship. However, the way he handles the situation matters. If he's confrontational, it might escalate the problem. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not the method.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were justified. Since he's pointing out a double standard and not engaging in any wrongdoing (no flirting or trying to pursue the coworker), he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy is her issue to manage, but the author has the right to express his feelings about the unfairness.\n"
