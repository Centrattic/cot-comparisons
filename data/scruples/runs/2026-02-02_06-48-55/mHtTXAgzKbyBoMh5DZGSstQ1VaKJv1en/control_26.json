A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe guy's girlfriend talks to her ex all the time, but he's not too bothered because they only talk about home stuff and mutual friends. The guy has a female coworker named A who he's been friends with since he started working there. He never asked her out and only has her number for work reasons. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got really upset. He then confronted her about it, pointing out the double standard with her being friends with her ex, which she had previously done without issue. Now he's considering bringing it up again and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The main issue is about perceived double standards in the relationship. The girlfriend is upset about the coworker friendship, while she's allowed to maintain a friendship with her ex. The author is frustrated because he's being treated unfairly. \n\nI should consider the nature of the relationships. The ex is someone the girlfriend used to be in a relationship with, and they still talk occasionally about non-romantic topics. The coworker is someone the author has a purely platonic relationship with, and he's never shown any romantic interest. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on jealousy or insecurity, even though there's no indication the author is doing anything wrong.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The author is pointing out a double standard, which is a valid concern. If the girlfriend is allowing herself to have a close relationship with her ex but is upset about her partner's similar behavior with a coworker, that inconsistency could be an issue. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this, especially since there's no evidence of wrongdoing on his part.\n\nHowever, I should also think about the context. The ex lives a few hours away and they don't talk often, which might be different from the current situation. But the author's coworker is at work, and their interactions are work-related. The author is not hiding anything; he's had this friendship for a while. The girlfriend's sudden anger might stem from her own insecurities rather than any actual threat.\n\nAnother aspect is whether the author should confront her again. While the initial confrontation was about pointing out the double standard, bringing it up again might escalate things if she's still upset. But the author's intention is to highlight fairness, which is reasonable. The key is whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything to violate the relationship's boundaries if they exist. The girlfriend's reaction is the issue here. The author is defending his position by pointing out the inconsistency. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
