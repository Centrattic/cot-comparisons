A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend being upset because he's friends with a coworker, while she's friends with an ex. He's considering turning the tables on her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend saw him talking to a coworker and got upset. He argues that she's allowed to be friends with her ex, but he can't be friends with his coworker. The coworker is just a work friend, and he's never made moves on her. She doesn't even see her outside work. On the other hand, her ex lives a few hours away and they talk about mutual friends and home stuff, which seems more substantial than just occasional work chats.\n\nThe author is planning to confront her about this inconsistency. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key here is double standards in relationships. If the girlfriend is allowed to have a close relationship with an ex, but the author is not allowed to have a friendship with a colleague, that's a problem. The author's point is valid\u2014why is her friendship with an ex acceptable, but his with a coworker isn't? Especially since the coworker isn't a threat in the same way an ex might be.\n\nHowever, maybe the girlfriend felt that the coworker being a female might trigger jealousy, which is a common issue. But the author hasn't done anything inappropriate. The problem arises from the girlfriend's reaction, not the author's actions. The author is defending his boundaries and pointing out the inconsistency, which is reasonable. \n\nBut is bringing it up to \"turn the tables\" fair? It might come off as confrontational. However, the author isn't doing anything wrong by highlighting the double standard. If the girlfriend is being unfair, addressing it is necessary for a healthy relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out an inconsistency in their relationship dynamics. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
