He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally. The author doesn't mind that. But when the author is seen chatting with a coworker named A, the girlfriend gets mad. The author then confronts her about it, pointing out the inconsistency since she's allowed to be friends with her ex, but he can't even be friends with a coworker he's never dated. The user is wondering if the author is in the wrong for bringing this up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to have a relationship with, and they talk about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker is just a friend from work, no romantic interest. The author never made moves on her and only has her number for work reasons.\n\nThe key issue is the double standard. The girlfriend is upset about a friendship where there's no romantic history, while she maintains a friendship with her ex. The author is pointing out this inconsistency. But is the author in the wrong for confronting her about it?\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel respected and that there's mutual trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity. The author's action could be seen as addressing an unfair comparison. However, bringing it up after the fact could escalate tension. The author might not be wrong in pointing out the inconsistency, but the timing and approach matter. If the author is doing it to provoke or without considering her feelings, that's different. But given the description, the author seems to be seeking fairness.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the situation presents a double standard, and the author is addressing it. However, the way it's handled could affect the outcome. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since the author's actions are based on pointing out an inconsistency they experienced, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
