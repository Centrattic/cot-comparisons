He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend being upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker, and he's considering calling her out on the double standard since she's friends with her ex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend talks to her ex, who's a few hours away, and they mainly discuss home stuff and mutual friends. The author has a female coworker, A, who's been a friend since he started the job. He never made a move on her, only has her number for work, and hasn't seen her outside work. The girlfriend got upset after seeing them chatting, and he's now questioning the fairness of her reaction compared to her own friendship with an ex.\n\nThe author is upset about being treated unfairly. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nNow, considering relationships and jealousy, it's common for people to feel possessive. But the key here is the context. The ex is a past romantic partner, which is different from a current coworker. However, the ex might still have some emotional significance, whereas the coworker is just a friend. But the author never had any romantic intentions with coworker A, which might matter.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction could be based on insecurity or past experiences. The author's argument is about the double standard. Is it fair for her to be upset about a platonic female coworker when she's in a friendly relationship with an ex? \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's pointing out a perceived inconsistency. However, the way he approaches the situation could affect the outcome. If he's confrontational, it might escalate things. But in terms of right or wrong, the author hasn't done anything wrong; the issue is more about the girlfriend's reaction rather than his actions. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The problem lies in the girlfriend's jealousy and the double standard, not in the author's actions. He's justified in wanting to address the fairness of the situation.\n"
