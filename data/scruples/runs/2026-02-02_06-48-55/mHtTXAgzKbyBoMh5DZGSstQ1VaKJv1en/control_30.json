He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker named A. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which the author isn't upset about. The author is now considering confronting her about the perceived double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author mentions that he and his girlfriend have an open conversation about her ex, and he's okay with her friendship. However, when he's seen with another coworker, she gets upset. The author is pointing out a possible inconsistency here. \n\nI should consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author hasn't acted on any feelings towards A, only having a work-related friendship. The girlfriend's ex is someone she was in a relationship with, but they aren't in contact regularly. The author's issue is about fairness\u2014he's being judged for a platonic friendship while his girlfriend has a past relationship that's ongoing as a friendship. \n\nIs there a double standard? The author's action is about being friends with a coworker, which is common and not inherently problematic. The girlfriend's relationship with her ex is more personal, but since they aren't in a current relationship, it's a past relationship. However, the author's situation is different because he's not in a relationship with A, just a colleague. \n\nThe author is considering confronting her, which is a valid step if he feels the double standard is affecting their relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to address it. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether his actions (pointing out the inconsistency) are justified. Since the situations aren't exactly parallel (a past relationship vs. a current friendship with a coworker), but the author is not acting on any romantic intentions, it's about communication and fairness. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to discuss the perceived unfairness. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
