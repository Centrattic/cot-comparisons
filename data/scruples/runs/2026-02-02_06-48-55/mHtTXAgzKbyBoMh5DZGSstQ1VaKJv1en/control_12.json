He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a simple A or B answer, but I need to think through it first.\n\nSo the scenario: The author's girlfriend (gf) has an ex she talks to occasionally. The author isn't bothered by that. Then, the gf gets mad when she sees the author chatting with a female coworker they call A. The author uses A's number only for work, and they've never met outside work. The author points out that the gf can be friends with her ex but he can't even have a work friend. The author is considering bringing this up again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The gf's ex is a long-distance friend, and the author is okay with that. The author's coworker is a female he's been friends with for work, never had a romantic interest. The gf reacted negatively when she saw them together, but the author is now challenging her double standard.\n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships often involve mutual trust and understanding. If the author isn't doing anything wrong\u2014like having a secret relationship or showing interest in his coworker\u2014then his reaction might be justified. However, maybe the gf felt insecure, even if the situation isn't inherently wrong. But the author is pointing out a double standard, which is valid if the gf is allowed to have friends with exes but he can't have neutral work friends.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's not doing anything to violate their relationship boundaries, then no. The issue here is about the gf's jealousy and possible unfairness. The author is defending his right to have platonic female friends. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n\nBut I need to check if there's something I'm missing. For example, maybe the author's actions were misinterpreted. However, the coworker is only for work, no dates, and they don't see each other outside. The author's point is valid if the gf's jealousy is based on a double standard. So the answer is B.\n"
