He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend (gf) is upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker, A, during lunch. The author mentions that he's been friends with A since starting the job, but A is just a work friend with no romantic advances. Meanwhile, the gf has an ex she talks to occasionally, and the author doesn't mind that.\n\nThe key points here are about jealousy and perceived double standards. The author is upset because his gf is allowed to have a past relationship, but he's being criticized for being friends with a colleague. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for pointing this out.\n\nFirst, let's consider relationships and boundaries. In healthy relationships, both partners should have mutual respect and understanding. If the gf is upset about the author talking to a work friend, maybe there's an underlying insecurity or past issues. However, the author is not cheating or making moves on A; it's just a friendly work conversation. On the other hand, the author's gf is talking to her ex, which might be a red flag if that's a dealbreaker for the author.\n\nThe author's response to his gf's anger is to question the fairness of the situation. He's pointing out a possible inconsistency in how they view each other's friendships. If the gf's ex is a non-issue because they don't talk often and it's about mutual friends, then maybe the author is right to call out the double standard. However, if the author's actions made the gf feel uncomfortable, even if it's a friendship, maybe there's a valid reason for her reaction. But since the author hasn't done anything wrong, like flirting or cheating, it's about perceptions.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not have communicated his side clearly before the incident. If the gf felt threatened by the lunch conversation, maybe there's a need for better communication. But the author's act of talking to a coworker isn't inherently wrong unless the relationship has agreed-upon boundaries that prohibit that.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's just being friends and there's no prior agreement against it, then no. The gf's reaction could stem from her own insecurities. The author is highlighting a double standard, which is a valid point. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
