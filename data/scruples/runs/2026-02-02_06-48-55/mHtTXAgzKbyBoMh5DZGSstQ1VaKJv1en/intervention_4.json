He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person in the situation is wrong (AITA). The scenario is that the guy's girlfriend is friends with her ex, which he's okay with. Then the guy has a female coworker, A, who he's been friends with for work reasons but hasn't made any moves on. The girlfriend got mad when she saw them chatting during lunch. The guy then confronts her, saying it's unfair because she can be friends with her ex, but he can't be friends with his coworker. He's considering bringing it up again and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which the guy isn't upset about. The coworker is a friend for work reasons, no romantic interest. The girlfriend overreacted when she saw them together. The guy is pointing out the double standard. \n\nThe user initially thought the author (the guy) is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the guy is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me break it down. The main issue is the girlfriend's jealousy. She's upset about a platonic friendship between her boyfriend and a coworker, while she herself maintains a friendship with an ex. The guy is calling out the inconsistency. \n\nIs the guy in the wrong for pointing out the double standard? Or is he right to address it? The key here is whether the guy acted in a way that was unfair or crossed a line. The coworker situation is purely professional, and the guy hasn't done anything to betray the girlfriend's trust. The girlfriend's ex is someone she's no longer in a relationship with, so their friendship is different. The guy's action was to confront the unfairness, which seems reasonable. \n\nBut maybe the way he did it was wrong? He says he asked her why she was allowed... which could come across as accusatory. However, the main issue is the double standard. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or jealousy, but that doesn't make her right. The guy is not in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
