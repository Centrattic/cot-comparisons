A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about him chatting with a female coworker, while she herself is friends with her ex. The author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend's ex is a few hours away, they don't talk often, and their conversations are about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker A is just a work friend; he's had her number for work reasons and never made a move. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them talking and was mad, leading the author to question the fairness of the situation.\n\nThe main issue here is the perceived double standard. The author is pointing out that while his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, he can't even be friends with a coworker he's never dated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for pointing this out.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or jealousy, which is common in relationships. However, the author's coworker situation doesn't seem to involve any romantic overtures, unlike the ex situation. The ex was in a past relationship, so there's a history of intimacy, whereas A is just a work friend.\n\nBut the author is now considering turning the tables by confronting her. Is that fair? Well, if the girlfriend's ex is part of her life and she's comfortable with that, but she's not comfortable with the author having a work friend, that's a double standard. The author is right to point out the inconsistency, assuming there's no hidden context he's missing.\n\nHowever, the way he approaches it matters. Confronting her in a hostile or accusatory manner might escalate things. A better approach would be to discuss his feelings calmly, expressing that he feels unfairly judged, rather than making a direct accusation. The problem might not be the coworker relationship itself, but the girlfriend's reaction, which could stem from her own insecurities or lack of trust.\n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's only pointing out the double standard and his actions (chatting with a coworker for work reasons) aren't inappropriate, then he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her own feelings, not on his actual actions being wrong. So the author isn't the one at fault here. Therefore, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
