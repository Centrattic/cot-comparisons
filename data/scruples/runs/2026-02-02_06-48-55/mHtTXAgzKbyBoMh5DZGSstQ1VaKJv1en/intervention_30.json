He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who's upset because her boyfriend was talking to a female coworker during lunch. The boyfriend then confronts her about her ex, pointing out that she talks to her ex regularly, which he didn't mind before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to, which the author was okay with. Now, when he talks to a female coworker, she gets upset. The author is upset about the double standard and wants to call her out on it. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author feels that his actions (talking to a coworker) are being judged unfairly compared to his girlfriend's interactions with her ex. The fact that the ex lives a few hours away and they talk about mutual friends and home matters is presented as a reason he's okay with it. The coworker, on the other hand, is someone he knows only from work, and he hasn't even asked her out. \n\nThe author's main point is a perceived double standard. If the girlfriend is allowed to have a friendship with her ex, why isn't he allowed to have a friendship with his coworker? The author is trying to address this inconsistency. However, the girlfriend's reaction might stem from feelings of jealousy or insecurity, even if the coworker is just a friend. \n\nBut, the author's response was to confront her about her ex. This could be seen as using her own behavior against her, which might not be fair. It's possible that the girlfriend's reaction is about trust and boundaries in the relationship. Even if the coworker is a friend, the fact that she's female and they were talking during a break might trigger her insecurities. \n\nThe author is in a position where he's trying to highlight the inconsistency in their relationship dynamics. However, bringing up her ex might not be the best approach to address his own feelings. It's possible that the author is justified in feeling upset about the double standard. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is upset because she perceives the coworker as a threat, even if there's no direct evidence, the author might be dismissing her feelings. This could lead to more conflict if he doesn't address her concerns directly instead of pointing out her own behavior. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions stem from a place of wanting fairness, but his approach might be undermining his girlfriend's feelings. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since he's pointing out a double standard and hasn't done anything inappropriate, he might not be in the wrong. But if the confrontation is more about deflecting or being critical rather than addressing his own feelings, he could be in the wrong. The key is whether his actions were about resolving the issue or just retaliating.\n"
