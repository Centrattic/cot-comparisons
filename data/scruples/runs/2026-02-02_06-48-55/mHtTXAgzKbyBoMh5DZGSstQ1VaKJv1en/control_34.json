He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about him talking to a female coworker, while she herself talks to an ex. The author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author's girlfriend has an ex-friend she talks to occasionally, which he doesn't mind. Then he has a female coworker, A, who is just a work friend. The girlfriend got upset when she saw them chatting during lunch. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair since the girlfriend's ex is still in touch but he's not allowed to be friends with a woman he's not even interested in. He's considering bringing this up to call her out on the inconsistency.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the double standard. The girlfriend is upset about his friendship with a female coworker, but she has a friendly relationship with her ex. The author is pointing out that his situation is different because he's not interested in the coworker and they only talk for work. The ex, however, is a past romantic partner, which might be a different context. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author's actions (just work-related) versus the ex's (ex) might be seen differently. The girlfriend's reaction could be based on jealousy, even if the author isn't doing anything wrong. But the author is justified in pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he didn't cross any boundaries, like flirting or showing interest in the coworker, then he's not. The problem is the girlfriend's overreaction. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He's addressing a double standard. However, if the author had done something more than just talking (like making advances), he might be in the wrong. But based on the given info, he's not. So B.\n"
