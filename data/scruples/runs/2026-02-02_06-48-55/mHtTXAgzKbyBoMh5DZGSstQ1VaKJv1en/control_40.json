A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend is upset because her partner is friends with a female coworker, but she has a close ex. The author is considering confronting his girlfriend about this double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The girlfriend talks to an ex who's a few hours away, mainly about home and mutual friends. The author's coworker, A, is a friend since he started the job. He used to think she was cute but never made a move. They only communicate for work-related reasons and haven't met outside. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch, got upset, and the author is now questioning the fairness of her reaction.\n\nThe author is thinking of bringing up the double standard. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the girlfriend's ex is a past partner, which might be more sensitive. The author's friend is a current coworker. The girlfriend's reaction could be seen as hypocritical if she's okay with her ex but not with his current friend. However, the context matters. The ex is a past relationship, so ongoing communication might be normal, whereas a current friend in the same workplace could be more sensitive, especially if there's any potential for a relationship now.\n\nBut the author did not make any moves on coworker A, and they only interact for work. The girlfriend's ex, on the other hand, is someone she used to be in a relationship with. It's possible that the girlfriend's feelings are based on her own insecurities or past issues. The author's actions here don't seem to have crossed any boundaries if he's just maintaining a platonic relationship with a coworker.\n\nHowever, the key issue is the double standard. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with an ex, but he's not allowed to be friends with someone else. The author's actions in this case might be justified in pointing out the inconsistency, but the way he does it could affect the relationship. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for bringing it up, not necessarily the initial reaction.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for being a friend to a coworker or for pointing out the double standard. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own jealousy or past experiences, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to address it. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
