A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her.

She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who's upset because his girlfriend is friends with her ex, but when he talks to a coworker, she gets mad. He's planning to confront her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The girlfriend and her ex talk about things like mutual friends and home stuff, not much else. He doesn't mind the ex-friendship initially. Then, the author talks to a coworker named A at work. They're colleagues, have been friends since he started there, and he used to think she was cute but never made a move. The only reason he has her number is work-related. The girlfriend sees them chatting and gets angry, and he's now upset because he feels she's being unfair.\n\nHe's trying to point out the inconsistency: why is it okay for her to have a past romantic connection as a friend, but him having a female coworker friend isn't okay? He's considering bringing it up again. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's think about both sides. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or jealousy. Even if the ex isn't a problem in itself, she might perceive the author's interaction with coworker A as a potential threat. The author might be right to question the double standard, but the way he handles it matters. Did he communicate his feelings clearly? Did he consider her perspective? The fact that they had this discussion after the incident is important. If he's now planning to bring it up again, maybe he's being confrontational rather than seeking resolution.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels wronged because his actions are different from her ex's. He didn't make any moves on coworker A, whereas her ex is someone she had a past relationship with. The key difference is that the ex and the girlfriend are still in contact, but the author and coworker A are platonic. However, the girlfriend's jealousy might be triggered by the gender dynamic\u2014maybe she feels more threatened by a female coworker than a male ex. That could be an unfair bias on her part, but it's still her feeling.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for confronting her about the double standard? If he's doing it constructively, maybe not. But if he's using it to accuse or blame her without considering her feelings, that could be problematic. The question is whether the author is justified in calling out the inconsistency. If he's approaching it as a discussion rather than an accusation, he's not wrong. However, if he's trying to use it to punish her for her reaction, then maybe he is in the wrong.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess the situation. The author didn't do anything inappropriate with the coworker, and his actions are innocent. The girlfriend's jealousy is the issue here. By pointing out the inconsistency, he's not wrong for wanting to address the unfairness. However, the way he brings it up is important. If he's using it to argue or make her feel guilty, that's where things could go wrong. But the core issue is her jealousy, not necessarily his actions. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to talk about the double standard, but the method might be important. Since the question is whether he is in the wrong, the answer depends on the intent. If he's trying to resolve the issue by discussing the double standard, he's not wrong. If he's doing it to provoke or win an argument, then maybe yes. Given the context, he's stating his case and planning to confront, which is a reasonable step if done respectfully. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
