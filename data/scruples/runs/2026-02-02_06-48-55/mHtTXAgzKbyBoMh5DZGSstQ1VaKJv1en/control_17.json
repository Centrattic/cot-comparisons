A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset about him talking to a coworker named A, while the author is upset that his girlfriend can be friends with her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that his girlfriend talks to her ex, who lives a few hours away, and they mainly discuss things like mutual friends and home. The author doesn't seem to have a problem with that. However, when his girlfriend sees him chatting with coworker A, she gets angry. The author then confronts her, pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author and A are coworkers who have been friends for a while. The author used to find A cute but never made a move, and their contact is strictly work-related. The girlfriend's ex, on the other hand, is someone she's had a past relationship with. \n\nThe author's argument is about fairness\u2014he sees his own interactions as harmless friendship, while his girlfriend's similar interactions with her ex are allowed. But maybe there's a difference in the nature of the relationships. The ex is someone the girlfriend has a history with, which might be more emotionally charged. The author's coworker is just a colleague with no romantic history. \n\nBut wait, the author is bringing up the fact that his coworker is someone he never asked out, implying that the situation is different. However, the girlfriend's ex is a past romantic partner, which could be more sensitive. The author's response was to confront her about the double standard. Is that justified?\n\nIn terms of the wrong-doing, the author didn't do anything wrong by talking to a coworker. The issue might be more about the girlfriend's insecurity or perception. The author's act of pointing out the inconsistency might be seen as a way to address the unfairness he feels, but doing so in a confrontational way could escalate the situation. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't do anything that's comparable to the girlfriend's situation (his coworker isn't a past lover), he's not in the wrong for being friends with her. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity, not on the author's actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, but the way he approaches it might affect the relationship dynamics. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No).\n"
