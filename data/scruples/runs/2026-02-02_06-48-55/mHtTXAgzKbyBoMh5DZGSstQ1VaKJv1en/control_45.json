He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on his girlfriend regarding her ex. The situation is that the girlfriend is upset about the author chatting with a coworker, A, but he's pointing out that she talks to her ex regularly. He's considering bringing it up again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The key points here are about fairness and double standards. The girlfriend is upset about him talking to a female coworker, even though he's never even asked her out, just friends. Meanwhile, she's allowed to talk to her ex, who's a few hours away. The author is trying to highlight this inconsistency.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for pointing out her double standard? Well, wanting to address an inconsistency in how the girlfriend treats relationships isn't inherently wrong. If the girlfriend's behavior is causing him distress, it's reasonable for him to want to discuss it. However, the way he approaches it matters. He's considering \"turning the tables,\" which could be a confrontational move. \n\nBut the core issue is whether his actions (just chatting with coworker A) were wrong in the first place. Since he's not doing anything inappropriate and just maintaining a work friendship, he's not at fault there. The problem is the girlfriend's reaction. By pointing out her inconsistency, he's not wrong, but he should approach the conversation calmly and respectfully, not as a way to retaliate or provoke.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's addressing a fair issue of double standards. However, the user might want to consider the method of communication to ensure it's constructive rather than confrontational.\n"
