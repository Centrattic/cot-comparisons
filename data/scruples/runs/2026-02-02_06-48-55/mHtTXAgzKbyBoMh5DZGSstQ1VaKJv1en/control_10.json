He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is asking if they're at fault for turning the tables on their girlfriend. The setup is that his girlfriend talks to her ex a lot, but when he chats with a female coworker, she gets mad. The author is pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex is someone from the past, and they talk about mutual friends and stuff. The author mentions that he doesn't mind her talking to the ex. But then his girlfriend gets upset when she sees him chatting with coworker A. The key point is that the author is questioning the double standard.\n\nIs there a reason the author is in the wrong? Well, the author didn't make any moves on the coworker and only has her number for work. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is friends with her ex, which might be a different context. If the girlfriend isn't in a relationship with her ex anymore, then talking to him might be okay. But if the author's jealousy is about being friends with a coworker, maybe the girlfriend's actions are more problematic if she's in a relationship.\n\nWait, the author is in a relationship with the girlfriend. So if the girlfriend is in a relationship and talks to her ex, that's a red flag. The author is highlighting that inconsistency. The girlfriend is upset about his friendship with a coworker, but she's okay with talking to an ex. That seems unfair. The author is pointing out the double standard, so he's not the one being hypocritical here.\n\nBut maybe the girlfriend's ex is just a friend, and she's allowed to have that. But the author isn't with the ex, so maybe the girlfriend's actions are crossing a line. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for confronting her about it. Since he's pointing out the inconsistency without being hypocritical himself, he's probably justified. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
