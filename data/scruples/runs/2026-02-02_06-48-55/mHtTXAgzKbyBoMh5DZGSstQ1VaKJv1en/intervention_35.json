He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who's upset because the author was chatting with a female coworker. The author then confronts her about it, pointing out that she's allowed to be friends with her ex, who they had a past relationship with, but he can't even be friends with a coworker he's never asked out. The author is considering bringing it up again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a coworker. The author is trying to highlight a double standard here. The key points are whether the author's actions were appropriate and if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away, and they talk mainly about home and friends. The author's coworker is just a work friend, no romantic advances. The author uses his girlfriend's ex situation to justify his own actions, which is a valid comparison. But is it fair to use that to justify his own behavior?\n\nJealousy in relationships can be tricky. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity, even if there's no real threat. The author's coworker is not a romantic interest, but the girlfriend's ex is someone she dated. The author didn't have a romantic relationship with the coworker, whereas the ex and the girlfriend did. So maybe there's a difference in the nature of the relationships here.\n\nHowever, the author is pointing out a possible double standard. If the girlfriend is allowed to keep in touch with her ex, then why is the author being criticized for a platonic relationship with a coworker? The author's argument is about fairness and consistency in expectations.\n\nBut does that mean the author is in the right? The author could have handled the situation better by addressing his feelings calmly instead of turning it into a confrontation. Turning the tables might come off as accusatory, even if the point is valid. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own feelings, and the author's response could escalate the conflict unnecessarily.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with a coworker, especially since there's no romantic interest. The real issue here is the girlfriend's jealousy and the author's response to it. The author's actions are a reaction to his girlfriend's behavior, so it's a matter of whether his response is justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might not be wrong, but his approach in turning the tables could be seen as confrontational. If he's asking whether he's in the wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The girlfriend's jealousy isn't the author's fault, but how he handles it matters. If he's being fair and pointing out a double standard, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he's doing it might not be the best approach. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's pointing out an inconsistency, but the method could be better.\n"
