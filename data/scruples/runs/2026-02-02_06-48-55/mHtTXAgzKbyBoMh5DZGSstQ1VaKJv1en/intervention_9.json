      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend (gf) is friends with her ex, and the author doesn't mind that. The ex lives a few hours away and they talk occasionally about things like home and mutual friends. Then, the author has a coworker named A who he's been friends with since starting the job. He used to think she was cute but never made a move, and only has her number for work reasons. One day, the gf saw them chatting during lunch and got really upset. The author confronted her about the double standard, saying why is she allowed to be friends with an ex but he can't be friends with a coworker. He's considering bringing this up again and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. First, the author's gf is in contact with her ex, which is allowed by the author. The ex is in a different city, so it's not a close friendship. The author has a female coworker he's been friends with for a while, no romantic interest, just work-related contact. The gf gets upset seeing them together, leading the author to confront her about hypocrisy. \n\nNow, why would the author be in the wrong? Maybe because he's using the ex situation to justify his own actions. Even though he claims he's just friends with A and hasn't done anything wrong, bringing up the ex might be deflecting from his own feelings. Maybe he has unresolved feelings for A, even if he hasn't acted on them. Also, even if the coworker is just a friend, the girlfriend's jealousy is a valid emotion if she feels threatened. The author's reaction could be seen as trying to manipulate the situation by pointing out the double standard, which might not be fair if he's not actually in the same position as the ex. The ex and the gf have a past relationship, which is different from the author's coworker. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's feelings and using the ex as an excuse to justify his behavior. On the other hand, if the author is genuinely just friends with A and the girlfriend is being inconsistent, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But the key here is whether the author's actions are reasonable. The author is using the ex to justify his own behavior, which might be a red flag. Also, even if he didn't do anything wrong, confronting her in this way could be seen as a way to manipulate the situation. The author might be in the wrong for not addressing the underlying issue of his girlfriend's jealousy directly instead of using the ex as a shield.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is right to point out the inconsistency. If the girlfriend is allowed to be friends with her ex, then the author should be allowed to have a female coworker friend. But the key difference is that the ex is a past partner, which can be more sensitive. The author's coworker isn't a past partner but just a colleague. However, the girlfriend's reaction might indicate insecurity, and the author's response is to use the ex as a point of comparison. That could be seen as not being fair, as the situations aren't exactly the same. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being empathetic to his girlfriend's feelings and using the ex to justify his behavior. \n\nAnother angle: the author's coworker is only known through work, and the author hasn't even seen her outside of work. The ex is a past relationship, so there's a history. The girlfriend might feel the ex has a different kind of connection. The author's action of bringing up the ex could be a way to deflect from his own possible feelings towards A. So, the author might be in the wrong for using the ex to justify his own actions without considering the girlfriend's perspective. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because he's using the ex situation to justify his behavior, which might not be fair, and he's not addressing his girlfriend's feelings directly but instead pointing out a perceived double standard, which could be a way to avoid the real issue.\n"
