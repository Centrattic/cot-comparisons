He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend being upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker during lunch. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to about mutual friends and things back home, which the author doesn't mind. But when the author points out the hypocrisy, he's considering bringing it up again.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The key points here are about the friend's ex and the author's coworker. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with, and they maintain occasional contact. The author's coworker is just a friend from work, no romantic advances, and they don't see each other outside work. The girlfriend got upset after seeing them together, which the author finds unfair because he hasn't done anything similar to her.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author hasn't made any moves on his coworker, only work-related communication. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is in contact with an ex she had a past relationship with. The author is pointing out a double standard. But maybe there's a reason the girlfriend is uncomfortable. Even if the author is innocent, the presence of an ex might be more sensitive because of the past romantic involvement. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy, even if there's no wrongdoing. However, the author's coworker is a different scenario\u2014no prior relationship, just a friend. The author's argument is about fairness, but relationships can be about perception too. The girlfriend might feel that talking to an ex is more intimate or could lead to issues, while the author's friendship with a coworker is more neutral. \n\nBut some might say the author should be more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings. Maybe she's just uncomfortable with him interacting with any woman, even platonic. If the author brings it up again, it could lead to conflict. However, if he doesn't, the issue might fester. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nSince the author is highlighting a disparity in treatment (his girlfriend has an ex, he has a coworker), and there's no evidence he's done anything inappropriate, he might not be the asshole. But it's also possible that he's not considering her feelings. The answer depends on whether the author's actions are genuinely harmless or if he should have been more sensitive. The original post mentions the girlfriend \"lost her shit,\" which might indicate her feelings were hurt, even if the coworker interaction was innocent. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's pointing out a valid inconsistency in how he and his girlfriend are treated. However, the way he brings it up could affect the situation. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and there's no evidence of the author's wrongdoing, the answer should be B.\n"
