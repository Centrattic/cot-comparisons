He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker during lunch. The author then confronts his girlfriend about her talking to her ex, which he's not really bothered by, and points out the hypocrisy. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally about home, friends, etc. The author has a female coworker he's friends with but hasn't dated. The girlfriend gets upset when she sees them talking, and the author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think he is, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's argument is that his girlfriend's behavior is hypocritical. She's allowed to maintain a friendship with an ex, but he's not allowed to be friends with a coworker. However, the ex is someone she used to date, which might be more sensitive than a current coworker who's never dated the author.\n\nThe author's actions here are turning the tables by pointing out the hypocrisy. The user is asking if that's wrong. The main issues here are: 1) Is the author justified in confronting his girlfriend about a double standard? 2) Did the author act in a way that's respectful or manipulative?\n\nOn one hand, the author is addressing an inconsistency in the relationship. It's valid to discuss boundaries and expectations. If the girlfriend is upset about his friendship with a coworker, but isn't bothered about her ex, the author has a point. However, the way he's approaching it matters. If he's using it as a weapon to deflect from his own actions, that's a problem. But if he's trying to have an open conversation about mutual trust, it's a different scenario.\n\nAnother angle: the author's coworker is someone he's never dated, and the friendship is work-related. The ex situation is different because they were in a past relationship. The girlfriend might feel more threatened by an ex because of the history, even if they're just friends now. The author might not realize the difference in dynamics between a past romantic partner and a current coworker.\n\nThe author could be in the wrong if he's using his girlfriend's actions as a justification for his own, without considering the context. For example, maybe the girlfriend's boundary is that she's okay with her ex as a friend from the past, but uncomfortable with the author having a potentially romantic interest in a coworker. The author might be ignoring that the coworker is a current presence in his life, which could pose different challenges.\n\nHowever, the author's main point is about fairness. If the girlfriend isn't treating both situations equally, it's reasonable for him to bring it up. The key is whether the author is being constructive or just trying to win an argument. If he's escalating the situation to make a point, that could be unwise. But if he's seeking to understand and set mutual boundaries, it's a healthy discussion.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have a role. The author should have clarified boundaries earlier if he was uncomfortable with the ex, but since he wasn't, it's less of an issue. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or past experiences. The author's response should be about communication rather than confrontation. If he's calling her out in a way that's accusatory, it might be inconsiderate. But if he's approaching it with the intention to resolve the issue, it's more about seeking fairness.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is not entirely in the wrong. He's pointing out a legitimate double standard. However, the way he handles the confrontation matters. If he's being respectful and seeking a dialogue, it's not wrong. If he's using it to provoke or deflect, then yes. But based on the information given, the author is justified in addressing the imbalance in the relationship's expectations.\n"
