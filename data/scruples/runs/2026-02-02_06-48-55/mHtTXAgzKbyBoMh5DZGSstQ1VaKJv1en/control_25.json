He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's girlfriend being upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker, A. The author mentions that he's had a long-standing friendship with A, who's just a nice person and they've been friends since he started working there. He never made any moves on her and only has her number for work reasons.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she has an ex she talks to occasionally about home and friends. The author is upset that his girlfriend can be friends with her ex but he can't have a female coworker friend. He's considering bringing it up to call her out on the double standard.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the perceived double standard. The author's argument is that if his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, even if they don't see each other much and talk about mutual things, then he shouldn't be restricted from being friends with a female coworker. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on jealousy or insecurity, but the author is trying to point out the inconsistency.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, if the girlfriend can have a close relationship with an ex, but the author can't have a close relationship with a coworker, that's a double standard. However, relationships are about mutual respect and boundaries. The author's action of pointing this out is about addressing the inconsistency, which might be necessary for a healthy relationship.\n\nBut wait, the author should also consider if there's a reason the girlfriend is uncomfortable. Maybe she isn't jealous of the ex in the same way she is about his coworker friend. The ex is geographically distant and the communication is about mutual friends and home, whereas the coworker is someone he interacts with daily, which might be a different context. The author's coworker friend is just a friend, but the girlfriend might feel differently if the coworker is female and they're in the same workplace.\n\nHowever, the author is not doing anything inappropriate with the coworker\u2014he's just having a work-related friendship. If the girlfriend is okay with her ex but not with his coworker, that's a clear double standard. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is reasonable. So, is the author in the wrong? No, he's trying to address a fair point. The answer would be B, No.\n"
