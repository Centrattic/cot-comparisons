He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker. The author is questioning why his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't be friends with a coworker he's never dated. \n\nFirst, I need to check the facts. The author's girlfriend talks to her ex who lives a few hours away and they don't talk often. The author's coworker is just a work friend; he's had her number for work reasons and they've never been outside of work. The author didn't make any moves on her and hasn't even seen her outside work. \n\nThe girlfriend got upset when she saw them talking during lunch. The author is pointing out the double standard. The question is whether he's in the wrong for bringing up this double standard.\n\nHmm. So, the author isn't doing anything wrong here. He's pointing out that his girlfriend's ex is allowed to have a friendship (even if past romantic), but he can't have a platonic work friendship. The key here is that the author has no romantic or physical relationship with the coworker, whereas the girlfriend's ex is someone she had a past relationship with. \n\nThe author's argument is about consistency. If his girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with her ex (which she's doing), then he should be allowed to have a friendship with a coworker. The fact that the author hasn't made any romantic overtures and the coworker is just a work friend makes his position valid. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). He's not being hypocritical because his situation is different. He's not in a relationship with the coworker, whereas the ex was a past relationship. Pointing out the double standard is reasonable. The girlfriend's jealousy without a valid reason might be her issue, not the author's.\n"
