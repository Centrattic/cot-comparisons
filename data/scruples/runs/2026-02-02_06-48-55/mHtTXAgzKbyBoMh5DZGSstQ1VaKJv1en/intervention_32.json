He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. Let me start by reading the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author's girlfriend (gf) talks to her ex a lot, which he's okay with. The ex is a few hours away, and their conversations are about home and mutual friends. Then, the author has a coworker, A, who he's been friends with since starting the job. He used to find her cute but hasn't made any moves. The only reason he has her number is for work. The gf saw them talking during lunch and got mad. The author is upset because he feels it's double standards\u2014his gf can talk to her ex, but he can't even be friends with a coworker. He's considering bringing it up and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly, which he's not bothered by. However, when he has a professional and purely platonic relationship with a female coworker, his girlfriend gets upset. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here.\n\nI need to analyze if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the double standard in their relationship. The author is justified in pointing out that the rules aren't applied equally. His girlfriend's ex is someone she was in a relationship with, while the coworker is a professional acquaintance. The author hasn't done anything inappropriate, has a work-related reason for the contact, and hasn't pursued a relationship with his coworker. On the other hand, the girlfriend's ex is someone she had a past relationship with, which is a different dynamic. The fact that the author is pointing out the inconsistency doesn't make him wrong; it shows he's aware of the unfairness. The girlfriend's reaction could be based on insecurity or jealousy, but that doesn't justify her behavior. The author isn't being unreasonable here. Therefore, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
