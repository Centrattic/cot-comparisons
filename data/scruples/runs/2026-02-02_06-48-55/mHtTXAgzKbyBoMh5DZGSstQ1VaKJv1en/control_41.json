A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally. The author doesn't mind that, as they don't talk often and it's about mutual friends and home stuff. Then there's a coworker, A, who the author has been friends with since starting the job. He never asked her out, just work-related communication. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got upset. The author then called out the double standard, pointing out that his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't even have a friend at work.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the perceived double standard. The author is trying to highlight that his actions (being friends with a coworker) aren't comparable to the girlfriend's friendship with an ex, especially since there's no romantic history between him and coworker A.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's about consistency in expectations. If the girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with someone she used to have a relationship with, it's inconsistent to expect the author to not have a platonic friendship. The author's actions (chatting during lunch) are within normal coworker interactions, and he hasn't done anything to suggest romantic interest. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on jealousy or insecurity rather than any actual wrongdoing by the author.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. The key here is that the author hasn't acted on any romantic feelings, while the girlfriend's ex is a past relationship. The author's actions are more about highlighting unfair expectations rather than being in the wrong himself. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
