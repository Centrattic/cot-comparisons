He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nSo the setup is that the author's girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which the author isn't a problem with. The ex lives a few hours away, and they discuss things like home and mutual friends. Then there's this coworker, A, who the author has been friends with for a while. They chat during lunch, and the author hasn't made any romantic moves. The coworker's number is only for work. \n\nThe girlfriend gets upset when she sees them talking during a break. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair that his girlfriend can have a past relationship but he can't even be friends with a coworker. He's considering confronting her about it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, but the author is being criticized for being friends with a coworker. The author didn't make any moves on the coworker, just work-related communication. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate if the ex is not a current issue. \n\nIn relationships, jealousy can be an issue, but there's a difference between past relationships and current interactions. The ex isn't around much, and the author's coworker is just a friend. The author isn't doing anything questionable, like having a secret relationship. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity rather than actual wrongdoing. \n\nThe author is pointing out the inconsistency. If the girlfriend can have an ex friend, then the author should be allowed to have a coworker friend. The author isn't in the wrong because he's not violating any boundaries that his girlfriend hasn't set herself. Unless there were specific rules about not talking to coworkers, the author is within his rights. \n\nBut maybe there's an unspoken rule in the relationship about interactions with others. However, since the author hasn't made moves on the coworker and the relationship is purely professional, it's hard to see how he's at fault. The girlfriend's reaction is the issue here, not the author's actions. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The problem lies in the girlfriend's jealousy and double standard, not the author's behavior.\n"
