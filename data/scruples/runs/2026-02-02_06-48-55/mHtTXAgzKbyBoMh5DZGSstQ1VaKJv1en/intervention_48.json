He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because he was talking to a female coworker, but she has an ex she talks to. The author is considering confronting her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away and they talk about mutual friends and such, which the author doesn't mind. Then, the author's coworker A is a friend he's known since starting the job, and he's never pursued anything with her. The girlfriend gets mad after seeing them chatting during lunch, and he's upset because he feels it's a double standard. He wants to confront her about it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The author's girlfriend is talking to an ex, which could be a red flag in some relationships. But the author says he doesn't mind because they don't talk often and it's about mutual friends and home stuff. Then the author is friends with a coworker, which is normal, but the girlfriend gets upset. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nIs the author wrong to confront her? Well, in relationships, communication is key. If the author feels that the girlfriend's behavior is inconsistent or unfair, it's reasonable to discuss it. But maybe the author's approach could be better. The girlfriend might be feeling jealous or insecure, even if the situation is different. The author's coworker is a colleague, and the ex is a past partner. The dynamics are different. The ex might have more emotional baggage. \n\nBut the author's point is about fairness. If the girlfriend is allowed to talk to her ex, why can't he be friends with a coworker? That's a valid question. However, the ex and the coworker are different in nature. The ex is a past relationship, which can sometimes be more complicated than a current friendship. The author's coworker is just a friend, and he's never even seen her outside work. \n\nBut maybe the author's approach is confrontational. He's asking if he wants to \"turn the tables,\" which could be seen as deflecting instead of addressing the underlying issue. Jealousy in a partner can be a real issue, and it's important to approach it with empathy. If the author is just pointing out the double standard without acknowledging his girlfriend's feelings, that might not be the best approach. \n\nHowever, the core issue is the double standard. If the author is being treated unfairly, it's right to bring it up. The author isn't doing anything wrong by having a friend, so he's justified in questioning the girlfriend's reaction. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. He's trying to address a perceived double standard, which is a reasonable thing to discuss. The problem might be how he approaches the conversation, but that's about communication style rather than being in the wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
