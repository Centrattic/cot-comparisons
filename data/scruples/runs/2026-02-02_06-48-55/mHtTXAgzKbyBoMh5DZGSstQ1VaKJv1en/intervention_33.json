      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for turning the tables on their girlfriend. Here's the situation: the girlfriend talks to her ex regularly, which the guy is fine with. Then, the guy has a female coworker he's friends with, but when the girlfriend sees them chatting, she gets mad. The guy is upset because he feels it's double standards since his girlfriend is allowed to have a close relationship with her ex, but he's not with his coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The ex is a few hours away, and their communication is about home, mutual friends, etc. The guy's coworker is just a work friend; he's never shown interest and only has her number for work. The girlfriend's reaction seems disproportionate at first glance because the coworker isn't a romantic interest. The guy is pointing out the inconsistency, which could be a valid point.\n\nBut wait, there's a nuance here. The girlfriend is upset about the guy talking to a female coworker, even if just as friends. The guy is bringing up his girlfriend's ex to highlight the double standard. However, the girlfriend's ex is a past relationship, while the coworker is a current friend. Maybe the girlfriend is worried about future romantic feelings? The guy hasn't acted on any interest, but maybe the girlfriend's jealousy is based on past experiences or insecurity.\n\nThe question is whether the guy is wrong for calling out the double standard. If the girlfriend's ex is a mutual, non-romantic friend, then the guy has a point. But if the ex is still a romantic connection, that's different. The user mentions the GF's ex is \"ex\" and they don't talk often, but the nature of their communication (home, mutual friends) might be innocuous. So the guy's argument is valid. However, bringing up the ex in this context might be a way to deflect from his own actions. Also, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is about the public display of friendship (seeing them chat in person) versus private communication.\n\nThe guy's approach is to call out the inconsistency, but the way he does it might be confrontational. Instead of addressing his own feelings of being restricted, he's pointing out her behavior. This could be seen as deflecting. Also, even if the coworker is just friends, the girlfriend's reaction might be about the emotional safety in the relationship. The guy might be right that it's a double standard, but his method of addressing it could be problematic. The key here is whether the guy is in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. If the girlfriend's ex is allowed to be a friend but his coworker is not, then the guy isn't in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's ex is a different situation (like still having feelings), then the comparison isn't fair. But according to the description, the ex is truly an ex with no romantic contact. So the guy's argument is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong), but maybe there's more to consider.\n"
