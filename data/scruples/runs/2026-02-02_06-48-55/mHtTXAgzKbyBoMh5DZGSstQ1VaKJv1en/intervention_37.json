      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. So the scenario is that the author's girlfriend talks to her ex regularly, which he doesn't mind. But when the author is seen chatting with a female coworker (A), the girlfriend gets upset. The author then wants to confront her about the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to have a relationship with and they talk about mutual friends and home stuff. The author is okay with that because they don't interact often. Now, the author's coworker is a friend they've had since starting the job, and the author hasn't made any romantic moves on her. The author and the coworker only interact at work, and the author has her number for work reasons.\n\nThe key point is the girlfriend's reaction. She was upset after seeing them chatting, even though there's no indication of anything inappropriate. The author feels it's unfair because his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't be friends with his coworker. The author is considering confronting her about this inconsistency.\n\nNow, thinking about jealousy and relationships. In a healthy relationship, trust and communication are key. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with the author being friends with another woman, even if it's platonic, that's a communication issue. The author might have a valid point about the double standard, especially if the ex is just a friend to the girlfriend and not a current romantic interest. However, the author could have addressed the situation earlier or communicated better with his girlfriend to set boundaries or understand her concerns.\n\nBut the author didn't mention whether he had prior discussions with his girlfriend about being friends with the coworker. If he didn't set that up, then maybe the girlfriend's reaction is based on her own insecurities. However, the author is now thinking of \"turning the tables\" by pointing out the inconsistency. That could lead to a productive conversation, but it could also come off as confrontational.\n\nAnother angle: the author is justified in feeling that if the girlfriend can be friends with her ex, then he should be allowed to be friends with his coworker, especially since there's no romantic involvement. However, the ex situation is different because it's a past relationship, while the coworker is a current friend. The girlfriend might feel differently about her ex because of the history. But if the ex isn't a current partner, then the comparison might be unfair.\n\nBut the author's approach of \"turning the tables\" could be seen as manipulative or using the girlfriend's own actions against her, which might not be the healthiest way to address the issue. It's possible that the girlfriend's jealousy is a symptom of a deeper issue in the relationship, like trust or insecurity. The author should consider whether confronting her in this way is constructive or just stirring up conflict.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if he's been honest about his relationship with the coworker and there's no hidden agenda, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's reaction is based on her own issues and the author is now using that to point out her inconsistency, it could be a way to deflect from her feelings. Alternatively, the author is just seeking fairness and transparency.\n\nI think the main issue here is about communication and understanding. The author's right to be friends with a coworker isn't inherently wrong, but how he approaches the confrontation matters. If he's trying to call out the double standard in a respectful and open way, that's one thing. If he's using it to manipulate or guilt-trip her, that's another. The initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. Based on the info given, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to address the inconsistency. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own insecurities, and the author's actions are about seeking fairness. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
