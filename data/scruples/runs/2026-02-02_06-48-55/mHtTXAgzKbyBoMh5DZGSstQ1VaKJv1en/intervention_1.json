He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend who's upset because her partner is friends with a guy she used to date, but when the author (the boyfriend) is friends with a coworker, she gets angry. The author is considering confronting her about this perceived double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally about mutual friends and home stuff. The author has a female coworker, A, who's just a friend and they haven't even gone out. The girlfriend saw them chatting and got upset. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair since he didn't make any moves on A, while she's friends with her ex.\n\nNow, the main issue is about jealousy and perceived double standards. The girlfriend might be uncomfortable with the author being close to another woman, even if it's platonic. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is a valid point. However, relationships often involve boundaries and communication. \n\nThe author's actions: He's considering bringing up the inconsistency. Is that wrong? On one hand, he's addressing a fair point. On the other, he's bringing up the ex situation, which might be sensitive. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because the author is using the girlfriend's past to justify his current behavior, which could be seen as manipulative or bringing up past issues unnecessarily. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity rather than actual wrongdoing. The author might be right in pointing out the inconsistency, but the way he does it could affect their relationship. If he's confrontational, it might escalate things. However, if he's just addressing the unfairness calmly, it's reasonable.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The core of the matter is whether the author's actions (having a friend at work) are wrong compared to his girlfriend's (talking to an ex). Since he didn't make any romantic moves, his actions aren't wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy is her issue, not his. So the author isn't in the wrong for being friends with A, and pointing out the inconsistency isn't wrong either. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
