He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation involving their girlfriend's ex and a coworker.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their girlfriend talks to an ex regularly. They don't mind it because the ex is far away and they only discuss non-romantic topics. Then, when the author is seen chatting with a coworker (A), the girlfriend gets upset. The author is annoyed because they think it's double standards\u2014girlfriend can have an ex friend, but he can't have a coworker friend. The author is considering confronting her about this.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for planning to call out the double standards. Let me break it down.\n\nThe key points here are about perceived double standards and communication in a relationship. The author doesn't mind the girlfriend's ex, but the girlfriend is upset about his friendship with a coworker. The author is pointing out inconsistency. But wait, maybe there are other factors. For example, does the coworker situation have any potential for romantic tension? The author says they've never asked the coworker out and only talk work-related stuff. But maybe the girlfriend feels jealous because of past issues or insecurities. \n\nHowever, the author is comparing two different scenarios. The girlfriend's ex is a past romantic partner who's now a friend, while the coworker is a current friend. The author's situation might be different because the coworker isn't a past romantic partner. But the girlfriend might feel threatened regardless. \n\nIs it fair for the girlfriend to be upset? That's subjective. Jealousy can come from insecurity. The author, on the other hand, is pointing out a discrepancy. If the author is genuinely not interested in the coworker and there's no history, maybe the girlfriend is being unfair. But if the author had flirted with the coworker before, that would be different. According to the story, the author didn't make any moves on the coworker.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is based on the idea that their friend is different from the girlfriend's ex. The author's response was to confront the girlfriend about the double standard. Now, the author is considering bringing it up again. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to confront her? It depends on how they approach it. If they frame it as a discussion to understand each other's feelings, that's healthy. But if they're using it to accuse or provoke, it could escalate things. However, the initial confrontation was about pointing out a perceived unfairness, which is reasonable in a relationship. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but maybe the user is assuming the girlfriend has a valid reason. But the author's actions don't seem to cross any lines. The coworker is just a friend, and the girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own insecurities. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the double standard. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). The key is whether the author had any inappropriate intentions with the coworker, which they don't, and if the girlfriend's reaction is unwarranted based on the given info. The author is trying to communicate their feelings, which is important for a healthy relationship.\n"
