He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for addressing their girlfriend's jealousy over her ex. The situation is that the girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally, which the author is okay with. However, when the girlfriend saw the author chatting with a female coworker, she got upset. The author then questioned why it's okay for his girlfriend to have a past relationship but he can't have a friendly coworker.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about fairness and double standards. The author is pointing out inconsistency in the girlfriend's behavior. The ex is someone the girlfriend used to be in a relationship with, but they don't talk often. The coworker is just a friend, and the author hasn't even pursued anything with her. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy or insecurity rather than a valid reason.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the girlfriend is allowed to maintain a friendship with an ex, the author should be allowed to have a friendly relationship with a colleague. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with someone; the issue arises from the girlfriend's reaction. The author is trying to address the double standard, which is a valid point. \n\nHowever, the way the author brings it up might matter. If he's using it to provoke or turn the tables, maybe he's being a bit manipulative. But the core issue is about the unfairness. The author isn't in a relationship with the coworker, so the jealousy is misplaced. The girlfriend's reaction seems more about her own insecurities rather than the author's actions being wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. He's highlighting a fair point about mutual respect and equal treatment in relationships. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
