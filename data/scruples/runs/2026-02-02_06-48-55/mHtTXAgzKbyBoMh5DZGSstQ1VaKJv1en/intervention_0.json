      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend (gf) talks to her ex, which he doesn't mind. The ex is a few hours away, and their conversations are about home, mutual friends, etc. Then, there's a coworker named A who the author has known since starting the job. He used to think she was cute but never made a move, and only has her number for work. The gf saw them chatting during lunch and got mad. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair since his gf talks to her ex, but he can't be friends with a coworker. He's considering bringing this up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is the perceived double standard. The girlfriend has a history with her ex (implied to be more than just friends) and talks to him, while the author is being reprimanded for being friends with a coworker he's never even dated. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong by confronting her about this inconsistency.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's behavior: she's in contact with her ex. The author doesn't seem to have a problem with that since he says he doesn't mind. But maybe there's an unspoken issue? Like if the ex is someone she's still emotionally involved with, even if they don't see each other often. But the author mentions that they don't talk often and the topics are neutral (home, mutual friends). So maybe the ex is just a normal friend.\n\nOn the other side, the author's situation with coworker A: he's been friends with her since work, has her number for work, and never made any moves. The gf got upset when she saw them chatting. The author is pointing out that he's not even interested in A anymore, and that the gf's ex is a different case. \n\nIs the author's behavior problematic? Well, he's not doing anything inappropriate with A, just being friends. The girlfriend's jealousy is the issue here. The author is trying to address the unfairness of the situation. The problem might be that the author is comparing their situations, but maybe the girlfriend's ex is a different scenario. For example, if the ex and girlfriend have a history that's more complicated, even if they're not currently dating, the author might not be aware of all the nuances. However, the author is stating that he has no romantic intentions with A, so if the girlfriend is upset over a harmless friendship, maybe she's being unreasonable. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for confronting her? He's not doing anything wrong with A, so bringing up the double standard could be valid. However, the way he confronts her might matter. If he's accusatory, it could escalate things. The key is whether the author is justified in pointing out the inconsistency. Since the ex situation is allowed, but the author is being criticized for a work friend, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards B, that the author isn't in the wrong. The girlfriend's jealousy about a work friend who isn't a romantic interest seems unfair, especially when she's allowed to talk to her ex. The author is addressing the issue by pointing out the inconsistency, which is reasonable. Unless there's more context that makes the author's actions problematic (like if he's actually doing something with A), but based on the info given, he's just maintaining a friendship. So the answer is B.\n"
