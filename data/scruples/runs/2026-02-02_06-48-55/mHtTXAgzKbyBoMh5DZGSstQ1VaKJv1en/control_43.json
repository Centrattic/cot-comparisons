He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is about the girlfriend's jealousy over his friendship with a coworker, while she's allowed to stay in touch with an ex. The author is asking if he's at fault for wanting to confront her about this double standard.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally. They live a few hours apart and discuss things like mutual friends and home stuff. The author doesn't mind this. But when his girlfriend sees him chatting with coworker A during lunch, she gets upset. She's mad all day. The author then points out the inconsistency: she can be friends with an ex but he's not allowed to be friends with a coworker he's never even seen outside work.\n\nSo, the key points here are about perceived double standards. The author is upset because he's being treated unfairly. The girlfriend is jealous of his friendship with A but isn't concerned about her own friendship with an ex. The question is whether the author is wrong for confronting her about this.\n\nNow, considering relationships, trust is important. If the author hasn't crossed any boundaries\u2014like, he's not flirting with A, just chatting during lunch\u2014it's reasonable for him to be confused about why his friendship is an issue. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or past issues. However, the author's response is to call out the inconsistency. Is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to express his feelings if he feels treated unfairly. On the other hand, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is rooted in something deeper, like past experiences with the ex. The author might be overreacting by bringing up the ex's situation, which could escalate the conflict.\n\nBut the author is just pointing out the double standard. If the girlfriend is okay with her own ex but not his coworker, that's a valid point to raise. However, the way he approaches it matters. If he's accusatory, it might come off as confrontational. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not the method.\n\nThe main issue is the double standard. The author isn't doing anything wrong by having a work-related friendship, and the girlfriend's ex is a different situation. So, by pointing out the inconsistency, the author is justified. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
