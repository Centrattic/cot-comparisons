He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend (the author) who is upset because his girlfriend is friends with her ex, but he gets in trouble for talking to a female coworker. He's considering calling her out on the double standard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's ex is someone she's in contact with, but it's described as occasional and about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworker, A, is a female he's known since starting the job. He's friends with her, but they only interact at work. The girlfriend saw them chatting and got upset, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nThe main issue here is the perceived double standard. The author is comparing his relationship with a coworker to his girlfriend's friendship with her ex. The girlfriend's ex is part of her past, while the coworker is someone the author is still in a relationship with. Jealousy is a common issue in relationships, but the fairness of the jealousy matters.\n\nThe author hasn't done anything inappropriate with the coworker\u2014no advances, no dates. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is in touch with her ex, which might be a sensitive area. The key question is whether the girlfriend's actions are more problematic than the author's. The author is pointing out a lack of consistency in their relationship boundaries.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the girlfriend is allowed to have a friendship with her ex, but the author is not allowed to have a friendship with a coworker (even if innocent), that could be a valid point. However, exes can sometimes be a more sensitive topic because of the past romantic involvement. The girlfriend's ex might have a different context compared to a coworker, even if the interactions are similar in frequency.\n\nThe author's response is to call out the double standard. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so. If the girlfriend's behavior is indeed a double standard, then the author isn't in the wrong for pointing it out. However, if there's a reason the girlfriend's friendship with her ex is different (like emotional attachment or the ex's intentions), that might not be the case. But the story doesn't mention such issues.\n\nSo, the author's main point is about fairness and consistency. If the girlfriend is upset about his friendship while she has a similar or less restricted friendship with her ex, the author has a valid concern. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for bringing it up. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
