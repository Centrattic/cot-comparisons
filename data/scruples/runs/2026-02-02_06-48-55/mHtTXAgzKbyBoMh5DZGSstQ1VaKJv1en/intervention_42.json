He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who's upset because his girlfriend got mad at him for talking to a female coworker. He argues that his girlfriend can be friends with her ex, but he can't even be friends with someone else. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's ex is mentioned as someone she talks to occasionally about home and friends. The guy's coworker is someone he's had a long-time work relationship with, and he's never made any romantic moves. The key point here seems to be the double standard the guy is pointing out.\n\nThe girlfriend reacted strongly when she saw them talking during lunch. The guy feels it's unfair because his coworker isn't even a romantic interest, while his girlfriend is allowed to remain friends with her ex, who they have a history with. The guy is considering bringing up the inconsistency in their expectations.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from jealousy, even if the coworker isn't a threat. However, the guy's argument about the double standard is valid. If the girlfriend's ex is allowed to maintain a friendship, then the guy should be allowed to have a platonic friendship with his coworker. \n\nBut maybe the context matters. The ex is a past romantic partner, so there's built-in tension even if they're just friends. A coworker, who's never been pursued, might be a different situation. However, the guy is trying to highlight unfairness here. \n\nI think the guy isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. If the girlfriend is upset without valid reason (like actual infidelity or intent to pursue the coworker), then his reaction is justified. However, if the girlfriend feels insecure, communication is needed. But whether he's wrong depends on the context. Since he's not doing anything wrong (no advances, just work friendship), his argument is valid. So the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
