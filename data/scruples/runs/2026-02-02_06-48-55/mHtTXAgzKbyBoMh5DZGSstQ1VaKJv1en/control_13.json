He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author's girlfriend being upset because he was chatting with a female coworker. The author then points out that his girlfriend has an ex she talks to regularly, so he's questioning why he's treated differently.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's ex is someone she used to be in a relationship with and still talks to. The author's coworker, A, is just a friend, and they've never had any romantic interaction. The author isn't in the wrong for being friends with a coworker, especially since he hasn't done anything inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy or insecurity, perhaps projecting her own behavior onto the author.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are equivalent to his girlfriend's. The girlfriend's ex is an ex-partner, so maintaining contact could be a sensitive issue in a new relationship. However, the author's coworker isn't an ex or someone he's dating. The author isn't violating any boundaries that his girlfriend hasn't herself. \n\nThe author is pointing out a double standard. If the girlfriend is allowed to talk to her ex, then he should be allowed to talk to his coworker. The author isn't doing anything that warrants the same level of concern. So, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The issue is more about the girlfriend's reaction and potential double standards.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's highlighting an inconsistency in how he's treated compared to his girlfriend's own behavior.\n"
