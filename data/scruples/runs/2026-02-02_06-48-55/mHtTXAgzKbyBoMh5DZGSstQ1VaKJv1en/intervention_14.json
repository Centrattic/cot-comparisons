She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend talks to her ex a lot. They don't talk often, just about home and mutual friends. The author doesn't mind that. Then there's this coworker, A, who he's been friends with but has never asked out. They only interact at work, same place, same time. The girlfriend saw them chatting during lunch and got really mad. The author then confronted her about the double standard, pointing out that she can be friends with an ex but he can't even be friends with someone who's not a romantic interest. Now he's considering bringing it up again.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about perceived double standards and communication issues. The author is upset because his girlfriend got angry over a non-romantic interaction, while she's allowed to have a more romantic past friendship. But wait, the ex is someone she used to have a relationship with, whereas the coworker is just a friend. The author is pointing out inconsistency.\n\nBut maybe the issue is how he handled it. He says he's thinking of turning the tables on her. The question is whether that's fair. The girlfriend might feel jealous even if there's no real threat, and the author's response could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even though there's a double standard, confronting her in a confrontational way might not be the best approach. Also, the author might not realize that jealousy isn't always logical. Just because he's not interested in the coworker doesn't mean his girlfriend can't feel insecure. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's not the one being unfaithful or doing anything wrong by talking to a coworker. But maybe he's not considering her feelings and is using her own behavior as a weapon. That could be inconsiderate. The problem isn't necessarily his actions but how he's reacting to hers. If he brings it up again, it might escalate things. The right approach might be to discuss the issue calmly, not as a way to accuse her. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's pointing out a legitimate inconsistency. But maybe also A because he's not handling it the best way. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for the situation, not just his response. Since his actions (talking to coworker) aren't wrong, but his approach to confronting her might be. The initial question is about the situation described, so the main issue is the double standard. The author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by being friends with the coworker, so he's not in the wrong for that. However, if he's planning to call her out in a way that's dismissive or accusatory, that could be problematic. But the question is about the situation as it is now, not the future action of calling her out. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the act of being friends with a coworker isn't wrong, and pointing out the inconsistency isn't necessarily wrong either. The real issue is the communication and handling, but the initial action isn't wrong.\n"
