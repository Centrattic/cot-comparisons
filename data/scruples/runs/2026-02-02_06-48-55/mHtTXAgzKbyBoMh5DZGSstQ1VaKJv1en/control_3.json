He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author's girlfriend is upset because she saw him talking to a female coworker. The author is upset because his girlfriend talks to her ex, but he's being accused of doing something similar.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend's ex is several hours away, and they talk about mutual friends and home stuff. The author's coworkers are at the same workplace. The girlfriend got mad after seeing them chatting during lunch. The author is questioning the double standard here.\n\nThe author argues that since his girlfriend can have a close relationship with her ex, he should be able to have a friendly relationship with his coworker. The coworker isn't someone he's interested in romantically, just a work friend. The girlfriend's reaction feels unfair to him.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, trust and communication are important. The author didn't make any moves on the coworker and only knows her through work. The girlfriend's ex is an ex, so there might be different expectations. But the author is pointing out a double standard. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the girlfriend feels uncomfortable seeing her partner talking to another woman, but the author is allowed to talk to his ex, then there's inconsistency. The author's actions aren't necessarily wrong if he's not violating any boundaries. However, the way he's approaching the situation might affect the relationship. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's not doing anything inappropriate and is pointing out a double standard, then he's not in the wrong. The key is whether his actions are justified. Since he's maintaining friendly work relations and she's upset over an ex, the author might be right to address the inconsistency. However, the way he brings it up matters. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's not doing anything wrong and is highlighting a double standard. The issue is more about the girlfriend's insecurity or inconsistent standards rather than the author's actions.\n"
