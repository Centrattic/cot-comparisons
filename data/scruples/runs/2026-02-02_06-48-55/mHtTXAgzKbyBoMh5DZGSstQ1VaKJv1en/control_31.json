A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend is friends with her ex, which he's okay with. The ex lives a few hours away, and they talk about things like mutual friends and stuff from back home. The author doesn't have a problem with that.\n\nThen there's this coworker named A. The author and A have been friends since he started working there. The author used to think she was cute but never made a move. He only has her number for work reasons and hasn't seen her outside of work. The girlfriend showed up during a lunch break, saw them chatting, got really mad, and was upset the rest of the day. The author then confronted her by pointing out that she's allowed to be friends with her ex, but he can't even be friends with someone he's never dated. Now he's thinking about bringing it up again.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong here? Let's break it down. First, the girlfriend's behavior: she's friends with her ex, which the author is okay with. But when the author is friends with a coworker (who he didn't even ask out), she gets upset. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, it seems unfair that his girlfriend can have a friendship with an ex that she's still technically in a relationship with, but he can't have a platonic friendship with a coworker. The author isn't doing anything wrong by being friends with A\u2014no physical contact, no romantic interest, just coworkers. The girlfriend's reaction is based on jealousy or insecurity, maybe projecting her own behavior onto him. \n\nThe key point here is the double standard. The author is trying to highlight that his girlfriend is being inconsistent. If she's allowed to be friends with her ex, why isn't he allowed to be friends with a coworker? The author isn't doing anything that crosses into the realm of cheating or being flirtatious. The girlfriend's ex is not in the picture anymore, but she's still friends with him, which she considers acceptable. The author's coworker is a current coworker, and there's no romantic overtures from either side. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong. He's being reasonable by pointing out the inconsistency. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's reaction and her double standards. The author isn't violating any boundaries he hasn't been given, so he's in the right to address the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
