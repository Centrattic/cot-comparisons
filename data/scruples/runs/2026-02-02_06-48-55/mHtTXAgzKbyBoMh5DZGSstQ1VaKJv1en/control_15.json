He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy whose girlfriend is upset because he was seen talking to a female coworker. The guy points out that his girlfriend talks to her ex a lot, but he's allowed to have a friend at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend sees the guy talking to coworker A and gets upset. The guy then confronts her about the double standard, referencing her ex. The main question is whether the guy is in the wrong for bringing up the ex situation when he's upset about his coworker.\n\nSo, the guy's argument is that it's unfair for his girlfriend to be okay with her ex but not his coworker. The girlfriend's reaction is based on jealousy or insecurity, perhaps. The guy is trying to address the inconsistency. But is he right to bring up the ex? \n\nI need to consider if there's a double standard here. The ex is someone the girlfriend used to have a relationship with, which is different from a coworker. The ex is geographically distant and they talk about non-romantic things. The coworker is a current friend, and the guy hasn't done anything inappropriate. \n\nThe guy's actions are being called out by the girlfriend, but he's pointing out a possible inconsistency. However, relationships require communication and trust. Maybe the guy should have discussed his concerns about the ex earlier instead of bringing it up after the fact. But in this case, he's responding to her reaction. \n\nIs it wrong for him to call her out? If the ex situation was a known issue, maybe he's justified. But if the ex isn't a problem and the coworker is a new issue, perhaps the guy is overstepping. Also, the guy isn't doing anything wrong with coworker A, but the girlfriend's jealousy is a separate issue. \n\nI think the key here is whether the guy's actions are equivalent. The ex is a past relationship, and the coworker is a current platonic friend. The guy isn't showing interest in the coworker, just being friendly. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity, but the guy's pointing out the inconsistency isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the guy isn't in the wrong (B), but it's a complex situation. However, the main question is if he's in the wrong. Since he's addressing a double standard and his actions towards the coworker are innocent, he's probably not in the wrong. But the way he brings it up could affect the situation. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about how to handle it. So answer B.\n"
