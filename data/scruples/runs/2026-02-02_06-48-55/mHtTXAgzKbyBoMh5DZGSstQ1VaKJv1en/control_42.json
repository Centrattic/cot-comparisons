He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning the tables on his girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is upset because she saw him chatting with a female coworker, even though he's never asked her out. Meanwhile, the girlfriend has an ex she talks to occasionally.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend's reaction is based on jealousy when seeing him with another woman, even if it's just a work friend. The author points out the double standard, since his girlfriend is allowed to have a past relationship. The key here is whether the author's actions were wrong in bringing up this comparison.\n\nThe author didn't make a move on the coworker and only communicates with her for work. The girlfriend's ex is a former romantic partner, which might have different emotional implications than a work friendship. The author is trying to highlight inconsistency in their relationship boundaries.\n\nIs the author wrong for pointing out the double standard? If the girlfriend's behavior is indeed inconsistent, the author isn't in the wrong for addressing it. However, the way he brings it up could matter. If he's using it to manipulate or hurt, that's different. But from the description, he's seeking fairness.\n\nPossible issues: The author might be overreacting if the coworker situation is a red flag he's ignoring. But since he's not pursuing her, it's just a friendship. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from insecurity, not the author's actions being inherently wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. But he should consider her feelings and communicate it respectfully.\n"
