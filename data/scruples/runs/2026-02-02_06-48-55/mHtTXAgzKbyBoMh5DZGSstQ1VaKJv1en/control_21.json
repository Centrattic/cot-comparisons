He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves his girlfriend being upset about him chatting with a female coworker, while she herself is friends with her ex. He's considering pointing out the double standard.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's ex lives a few hours away, and they talk about home stuff and mutual friends. The author doesn't mind that, but when he chats with his coworker A, she gets upset. The key issue here is the perceived inconsistency in their behaviors. The author is pointing out that his girlfriend has a past relationship that they still communicate with, but he's not allowed to have a friendly relationship with a coworker he's never dated.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on a few factors. First, the nature of the relationships. The ex is someone the girlfriend was in a relationship with, and now they're just friends. The coworker A is someone the author has only been friends with for work reasons. The author hasn't made any romantic moves and only interacts with her for work. That seems innocent, but maybe the girlfriend felt insecure or jealous.\n\nBut then, the author is bringing up a valid point about double standards. If the girlfriend can maintain a friendship with her ex without issue, then why is the author being criticized for a similar, non-romantic relationship with a coworker? The author isn't doing anything inappropriate, like flirting or spending time outside of work. The coworker is only known through work, and they haven't even met outside of that.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity rather than any actual wrongdoing by the author. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency. However, the way he approaches it could affect the relationship. If he's confrontational, it might escalate the issue. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not how to handle it.\n\nSo, considering that the author isn't acting inappropriately (no flirting, no dating, just work-related interactions) and his girlfriend's ex is a different situation (past relationship vs. current coworker), the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is the girlfriend's jealousy and double standard. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
