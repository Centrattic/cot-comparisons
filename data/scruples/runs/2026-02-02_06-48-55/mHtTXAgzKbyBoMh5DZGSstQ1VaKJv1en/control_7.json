He lives a few hours away and they dont talk often, mainly about things back home, mutual friends, etc.\n\nThere is a girl I work with, let's call her A. A is very nice, and she and I have been friends since I started working at the place I do. I used to think she was cute, but I never made any moves on her. The only reason I have her number is for work related reasons, I have never even seen her outside of work.\n\nWell the other day my gf stopped by while i was on my break and saw A and I chatting while we were eating lunch. She lost her shit, and was mad at me for the rest of the day. I asked her why she was allowed to be friends with a guy she used to fuck but I cant be friends with a girl who I never even asked on a date.\n\nThis situation hasn't come full circle yet, and i'm thinking about bringing it back up. I dont think it was fair, and I want to call her out on it. WIBTA for calling her out or should I let it be?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the guy is upset because his girlfriend got mad at him for talking to a coworker named A during lunch. He didn't make any moves on her and only has her number for work. The girlfriend is mad about this, and he's upset because she's allowed to talk to her ex, who she used to be in a relationship with, even though they don't talk often now. He's considering bringing it up again to point out the inconsistency.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the girlfriend's jealousy versus the author's actions. The author mentions that he and the coworker are just friends, no romantic involvement. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has an ex she's friends with. The author is pointing out the double standard. \n\nIs there something the author did wrong? He was talking to a female coworker during lunch, which is reasonable in a workplace setting. There's no indication he did anything inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction seems based on jealousy, but the author isn't the one being unfair here. He's actually pointing out a lack of consistency in her behavior. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural or personal expectation thing here. Some people might feel uncomfortable if their partner talks to someone they find attractive, even if there's no romantic intent. But in this case, the author hasn't done anything to suggest he's interested in the coworker. He's even clarifying that he's just friends with her. \n\nThe girlfriend's ex, though, is someone they used to be in a relationship with. If the ex is a close friend, that could be a different scenario. But the author's situation is about a coworker he hasn't even seen outside work. \n\nSo, if the author is bringing up the double standard to address the unfairness, he's probably not in the wrong. The issue is more about the girlfriend's reaction and her need for consistency. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
