My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the wife eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The user is asking if they are the asshole for asking her to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is very clear that he's protective of his food. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she keeps taking more, leading to him feeling like he's competing for his own meal. When he gave her the plate, which he thought was his own food, it led to a fight. The wife is upset, feeling judged or called out for eating his food, even though the author says he's okay with her trying it. \n\nNow, from a fairness standpoint, if someone orders their own meal, it's reasonable to expect that they have ownership over their portion. The wife is taking without permission beyond a couple of bites, which the author has already set as the limit. However, some might argue that sharing food can be a sign of intimacy and bonding, and pushing back on that could be seen as being overly controlling. But the key here is that the author has communicated his boundaries and the wife is not respecting them. \n\nThe author's actions, like giving her the plate when she's eating his food, might come off as confrontational, but his intent was to enforce the boundary he had already discussed. The wife's reaction seems to be about feeling criticized for her actions, which she sees as playful and cute, but the author is genuinely distressed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting boundaries around his personal space and belongings (his food). The wife not respecting those boundaries is the issue here. The problem isn't with the author asking for his space but with the wife not respecting his established limits. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
