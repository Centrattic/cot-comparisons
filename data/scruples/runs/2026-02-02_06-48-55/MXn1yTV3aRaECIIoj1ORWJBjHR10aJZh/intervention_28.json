My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband who's upset that his wife eats off his plate when they eat out. He's tried to communicate his boundaries, but she keeps doing it, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband feels protective of his food, which is understandable. People have different levels of comfort with sharing food. He's clear about wanting to share a bite or two but not the whole meal. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and bonding. She might not realize how much it's bothering him.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect for boundaries. The husband has communicated his feelings multiple times, which is good. He's even offered solutions like paying for her to get the same dish. However, when she continues, he reacts by giving her the plate, which she finds hurtful. \n\nI need to assess if the husband's reaction was appropriate. Taking away the plate might have been a way to enforce his boundary, but it could come off as harsh. The wife might feel disrespected, especially if she didn't understand the extent of his discomfort. The fight arose from a lack of immediate resolution despite prior communication.\n\nThe husband isn't wrong in wanting to have his own food. It's a personal preference, and it's reasonable to expect others to respect that. However, the way he enforced it led to conflict. Maybe a more effective approach would be to find alternative ways to bond without involving his food, like choosing shared dishes more often or planning activities together outside of meals.\n\nIn the end, both parties have valid points. The husband isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, but his method of enforcing them might have been too abrupt. The wife might need to be more considerate of his feelings. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether his actions were justified. Since he tried to communicate and only escalated when his boundaries were repeatedly crossed, he's more in the right. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
