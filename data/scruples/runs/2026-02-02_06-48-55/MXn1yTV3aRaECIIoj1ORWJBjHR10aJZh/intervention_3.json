My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author wrote about their wife eating off their plate when they eat out, and they're upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is clearly frustrated. They mention being very protective of their food, which is understandable. They've tried to set boundaries, like allowing a few bites but not treating the meal as shared. However, the wife seems to continue eating from the author's plate, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, from their perspective, they've communicated their feelings and tried to find solutions. They're not unreasonable\u2014they\u2019re okay with sharing a little but not the entire meal. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the author is being too strict or not flexible. But the author's main point is about respecting their personal choice and boundaries regarding their own meal. \n\nThe wife's actions cause the author discomfort and reduce their meal size, which is valid. The author's request is reasonable: if the wife wants to eat something, they can order it themselves. The problem arises because the wife isn't respecting the author's boundaries despite multiple attempts to address it. \n\nHowever, the author's response of giving the plate to the wife might have come off as harsh, possibly contributing to the argument. But the core issue is about respecting personal boundaries. The author isn't wrong for wanting their food to be theirs. They've made their preferences clear. The wife's reaction might stem from not seeing the issue as the author does, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to their own food and have tried to communicate their needs. The problem is a communication breakdown, but the author's stance is reasonable.\n"
