My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate. The situation is that the wife keeps taking bites from the author's plate when they order different things at restaurants. The author feels protective of their food, and this has led to arguments.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and respect in a relationship. The author has tried to communicate their discomfort by setting limits\u2014allowing a couple of bites but not treating the food as a shared meal. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, leading to the author feeling like they're competing for their own food.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being reasonable. In many cultures, sharing food can be a sign of closeness, but when it's about separate orders, there might be different expectations. The author's issue isn't with sharing per se, like communal dishes, but with others taking from their personal plate. The wife's actions, even if meant to be friendly, might be crossing a boundary that the author has clearly set.\n\nThe author has tried to explain their stance multiple times, which shows they're not being unreasonable. They've offered solutions like paying for her to have the same dish next time. The conflict arises because the wife isn't respecting these boundaries, leading to frustration and a fight. \n\nIs the author at fault? If the author has communicated their needs clearly and the wife continues the behavior, then the fault isn't on the author. The wife's actions are the issue here. However, the author's reaction of giving her the plate might have come across as harsh, but the underlying problem is the wife not respecting the author's wishes. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have a valid concern about their personal space and food, and they've made their boundaries clear. The wife is the one not respecting those boundaries, leading to the conflict.\n"
