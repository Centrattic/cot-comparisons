My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation is that they go out to eat, order different things, and the wife eats from his plate. The author is really upset about this, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels his personal space and food are being invaded. He's set boundaries before, but she keeps doing it. He even offers to pay for her to have her own food. On the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute, maybe a way to bond. The fight happened when he gave her the plate, making her feel like a pig. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, food is personal. People have different comfort levels. If he's uncomfortable with her eating his food, it's valid to ask her to stop. But maybe his approach could be better. Giving her the plate might have been a harsh reaction. However, the wife continued despite his clear requests, which might mean she's not respecting his boundaries. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because in relationships, some give and take is expected. The wife might feel it's a small thing, and the author is overreacting. Also, the fight escalated because of his reaction. \n\nBut I think the author is not in the wrong. He's expressed his feelings multiple times, tried compromises, and it's about personal boundaries. The wife's actions are the issue here, not his response. He's within his rights to want his food to himself. The problem is more on her side. So answer B.\n"
