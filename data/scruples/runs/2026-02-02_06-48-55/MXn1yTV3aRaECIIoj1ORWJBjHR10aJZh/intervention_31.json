My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his wife to stop eating off his plate. So, the main issue here is about shared meals versus personal plates.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's very protective of his food, referencing the Friends episode where Ross gets upset about the sandwich. That's a cultural reference that many people might relate to, indicating that this is a common issue some people have. The author has tried to communicate his boundaries, offering solutions like letting her have a few bites and even paying for her to get her own meal if she likes his food. However, the wife keeps taking more than a few bites, which makes the author feel like he's competing for his own food when they eat out.\n\nThe wife's perspective seems to be that sharing food is playful and bonding, and she might not realize how much it's bothering him. The argument escalated when the author gave her the plate, making her feel like a pig, even though he was the one trying to set boundaries. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author has clearly expressed his feelings multiple times, which is good. He's offered compromises. However, giving her the plate might have been a poor choice because it could have been perceived as shaming, even if it was meant to enforce his boundaries. The wife's reaction suggests that she felt attacked, which could have been avoided with a different approach.\n\nIn terms of personal boundaries, everyone has different comfort levels. The author's discomfort with shared plates isn't unreasonable. However, the way he enforced it might have contributed to the conflict. The key here is mutual respect. Both parties need to listen and adjust. The wife might need to respect the author's boundaries more, while the author could find a better way to enforce them without making her feel shamed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. If we consider that he's communicated his needs and tried to find solutions, he might not be in the wrong. However, the method of giving her the plate was inappropriate, leading to the fight. So maybe he's not entirely wrong, but his response could have been better. Alternatively, if the wife is respecting their shared meals as a bonding experience, maybe the author is overstepping. But since he's clear about his discomfort and has tried to find middle ground, perhaps he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but I lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's communicated his needs, even if the execution could be improved.\n"
