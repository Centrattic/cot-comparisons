My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation is about the wife taking multiple bites from his plate when they order different dishes, which stresses the author out and leads to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is clearly bothered by this behavior and has tried to communicate his preferences. He's offered solutions like allowing a couple of bites or paying for her to get her own meal if she likes his dish. However, the wife continues to take more than that, which makes the author feel like he's not getting enough to eat. He gives examples of her eating his food despite assurances she wasn't hungry, leading to a conflict where he gave her the plate, which upset her.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. She might feel that sharing food is a way to bond or show closeness. The author's reaction\u2014giving her the plate and calling her a pig\u2014might have been harsh, which could explain her anger. The fight might have stemmed from miscommunication or the author not addressing the issue in a more constructive way.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author tried to set boundaries but perhaps didn't express them clearly enough for the wife to understand. The wife might not realize how much this behavior is affecting him. However, the author's approach of giving her the plate could have been seen as dismissive or confrontational, escalating the situation. \n\nAlso, cultural norms might play a role. In some cultures, sharing food is common and seen as affectionate, while in others, personal space around food is important. The author might be coming from a perspective where personal boundaries are crucial, while the wife sees it as a gesture of intimacy.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he has a right to his personal space and food. However, his method of handling the conflict might have been part of the problem. The wife also has a responsibility to respect his boundaries once they're communicated. The fact that the author tried multiple times to explain his feelings but the wife continued suggests that both sides could have handled it better. \n\nThe author might have escalated the issue by giving her the plate, which could be seen as a power move rather than a compromise. The wife's reaction indicates that she felt attacked, which could have been avoided with a more calm approach. However, the core issue is about differing needs and boundaries. The author is justified in wanting to protect his meal, but the way he addressed the problem might have been harsh. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. Both parties have some responsibility. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he has a valid reason for his discomfort and tried to communicate his boundaries, but the way he enforced them might have been part of the conflict, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the initial act of asking her to stop isn't wrong. The problem is more about how the conflict was handled rather than the request itself.\n"
