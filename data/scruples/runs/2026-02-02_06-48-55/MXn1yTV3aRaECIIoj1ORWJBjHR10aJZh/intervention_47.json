My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The wife does this even after the author has set boundaries, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clearly uncomfortable with the wife's behavior. He values his own food and feels it's his when he orders it. He's tried negotiating, offering to buy her food, but she still takes from his plate, making him feel like he's competing for his own meal. The author ends up giving her his plate, which the wife resents, leading to a fight.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. She's taking a few bites and says she's just having a little. Maybe she doesn't realize how much it's affecting him. The argument arose when the author took away his plate after she took too much, which made her feel like a pig, even though the author was the one upset about her taking his food.\n\nNow, considering typical AITA scenarios, the key points are about respect for boundaries. The author has communicated his discomfort multiple times and tried solutions. The wife hasn't respected those boundaries, continuing the behavior despite the author's clear requests. However, the author's reaction of giving her the plate might have been abrupt, leading to the fight. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether he overstepped. He asked her to stop, she didn't. He tried to set clear boundaries. When she continued, he enforced them by giving her the plate. That action might have been harsh, but it's his right to protect his food. The wife's reaction is understandable but perhaps she should have respected his limits from the start. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did communicate, and the wife didn't adjust. So the fault might lie more with the wife. But the author's final action could have been handled better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's the one who set boundaries and tried to resolve it, I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
