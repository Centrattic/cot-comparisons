My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's wife eating off his plate when they eat out.\n\nFirst, the author is clearly bothered by this behavior. He mentions being protective of his food, which he references from the Friends show, indicating it's a known personality trait. He's tried setting boundaries\u2014allowing a few bites and offering to order for her\u2014but she continues. This led to conflict, with the wife feeling targeted when he took the plate from her.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: The author's main issue is about personal space and boundaries regarding food. He's communicated his feelings, but the wife doesn't respect them. The wife, on the other hand, might see it as playful sharing or bonding. However, the author feels his needs aren't being respected, leading to frustration and a fight.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his needs and boundaries, which is reasonable. People have different comfort levels with sharing food, and it's valid for him to want his own plate. The wife not respecting this after multiple discussions could be the issue. But maybe the author's reaction was too harsh, like taking the plate, which might have escalated the conflict. However, the core problem is the wife's continued behavior despite his boundaries. \n\nBut wait, is it possible the author is being overly rigid? Maybe the wife is trying to bond, and his response made her feel criticized. However, the author has tried multiple solutions. The fact that they fought after he enforced his boundary might indicate miscommunication. But the wife's actions are the root of the problem. The author isn't wrong for wanting his own plate; it's about personal preference. The wife not respecting that despite discussions is where the fault lies. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
