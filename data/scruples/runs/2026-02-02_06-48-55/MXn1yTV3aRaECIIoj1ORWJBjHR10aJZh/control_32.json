My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband being upset that his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband says he's very protective of his food and finds it annoying when his wife takes multiple bites from his plate. He's tried explaining that a bite or two is okay, but she keeps doing it, leading to arguments. His wife thinks it's playful and cute, but he feels like he's competing for his own food and ends up only half-full. The last incident ended in a fight, with the wife feeling hurt by him giving her the plate and the husband explaining his stance again.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's expressing a legitimate personal boundary. People have different levels of comfort when it comes to sharing food. The husband is clear that he wants his own food to himself, which is a personal preference. He's tried reasonable solutions like offering to order for her if she likes his food. The wife, on the other hand, seems to not respect his boundaries despite his communication. \n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The husband has communicated his feelings and tried to find compromises. The wife's actions are disregarding his boundaries, even after being asked. That could suggest that she's not respecting his needs, which would make her at fault. However, the husband's reaction of giving her the plate might have been a poor choice in the moment, possibly escalating the situation. But the main issue is the repeated disregard for his boundaries by the wife. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to respect each other's preferences. The husband isn't being unreasonable by wanting to keep his own plate. The wife's actions are the problem here because she's continuing to take from his plate despite his requests. So, the husband isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
