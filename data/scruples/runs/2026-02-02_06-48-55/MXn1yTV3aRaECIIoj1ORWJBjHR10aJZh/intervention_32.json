My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The wife does this, and it's causing conflicts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author clearly states that he's protective of his food and that his wife's actions make him uncomfortable. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a bite or two and offering to pay for her to get her own. But she keeps doing it, and it's leading to fights. Now she's upset because he gave her the plate and called her a pig, which she took as an insult. \n\nThe wife's perspective, as described, is that she sees it as playful and bonding. She might not realize how much it's affecting him. The author feels like he's losing out on his food and that it's not fair. He's consistent in his requests, but she's not respecting them. \n\nOn one hand, people have different boundaries. The wife might not see the issue, but the author is within his rights to want his own food. On the other hand, the wife is acting out of care or affection, thinking they're sharing. But when someone explicitly says they don't want it, it's a problem. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014like giving her the plate to stop her from eating his food\u2014might have come off as harsh. He could have handled it differently, like expressing his feelings without escalation, but the core issue is about respecting boundaries. The wife isn't respecting his boundaries despite multiple requests, which is a key factor here. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. It's reasonable to want to eat what you ordered without someone else taking from you. However, the way he handled the situation might have contributed to the fight. But the main issue is the wife not respecting his requests. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for asking her to stop.\n"
