My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the wife eating off his plate when they go out to eat. Let me start by understanding both sides.\n\nThe author is clearly very protective of his food. He doesn't like her taking bites from his plate, especially when they ordered different things. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, and even offering to reorder for her if she likes it. But she keeps taking more, which makes him end up half-full and stressed. The last straw was when he gave her the plate, leading to a fight where she felt he made her feel like a pig.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and bonding. She might think sharing food is a way to connect, especially if she tried it before and liked it. When he took the plate, she felt attacked or criticized, which led to her being upset. She might also feel that he's being overly controlling about something that she didn't think was a big deal.\n\nThe author's main argument is about ownership of the food he ordered. He's paying for his own meal, so he feels it's his to eat as he pleases. The wife's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if she's taking more than a couple of bites despite his requests. However, the way he handled it (giving her the plate) might have been confrontational and hurtful, which could be where he's in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the wife did agree to stop taking bites when asked before, but continued anyway. That seems like she disregarded his feelings. On the flip side, the author could have communicated his discomfort without being so abrupt. Maybe there's a middle ground where they could both find a solution that works for them. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the situation.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. The author expressed his concerns multiple times, and the wife didn't comply, leading to frustration. However, the way he took the plate could have been perceived as shaming, which might have escalated the conflict unnecessarily. So, while the author isn't entirely wrong for having boundaries, his reaction might have been the wrong approach. But the main issue is the wife not respecting his boundaries, which is her fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Hmm.\n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to protect his food and setting boundaries. It's his meal he paid for, and he has the right to enjoy it without someone else taking portions. However, his approach could have been better, but the core issue is the wife's actions. So the author isn't wrong, but maybe he needs to find a more constructive way to handle it. The wife is the one not respecting his boundaries.\n"
