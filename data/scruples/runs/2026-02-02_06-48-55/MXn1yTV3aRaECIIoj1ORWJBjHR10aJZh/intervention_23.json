My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who's upset because their wife keeps eating off their plate when they go out to eat. The author says they're very protective of their food, and the wife takes multiple bites from their plate, even after being asked to stop. This led to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels their personal space with food is invaded. They value having their own plate and not sharing it. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and maybe a way to bond. She might feel that sharing food is a sign of affection or closeness. \n\nThe author has tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites and offering to order for her if she likes. But the wife still takes more than that. The key issue here is consent and respect for boundaries. If the author has clearly communicated their discomfort and the wife continues, that's a problem. But maybe the author's expectations aren't realistic. Sharing food is a common social behavior in many cultures, and some people find it endearing. \n\nHowever, the author mentions that the wife ends up eating half the meal, leaving them half-full. That's a legitimate concern because the author isn't getting to enjoy their meal as intended. The wife might not realize how much it's affecting the author. The fight arose when the author gave away their plate, which upset the wife. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The author has a right to their own food and should be able to express that. The wife, however, isn't respecting those boundaries despite being asked. The author isn't being unreasonable here; they've tried compromising. The wife's actions are the main issue. The author's response, while maybe harsh (giving up their plate), is a reaction to repeated boundary violations. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of giving up the plate, they could have left the restaurant or addressed it calmly later. However, the core problem is the wife not respecting the author's wishes. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and expressing their needs.\n"
