My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation is about sharing food when they go out to eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly states that he's very protective of his food and finds it annoying when his wife eats from his plate. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a few bites, but she keeps taking more. This led to a fight where he gave her his plate, which upset her.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to respect his own preferences and set clear boundaries. He's communicated his issue multiple times and even offered solutions like paying for her to get her own food. He feels that when you order a plate, it's your own, and sharing beyond a few bites is not okay. His actions were meant to enforce his boundaries, even if it caused conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, his wife sees this behavior as playful and cute. She might feel that sharing food is a way of bonding and that the author is overreacting. When he gave her the plate, she felt judged, which led to her being defensive and upset. She might feel that he's being too controlling about a minor issue, making dining out stressful for her.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author's actions are unreasonable. Setting boundaries around personal space and belongings is generally acceptable. The author is expressing his discomfort and trying to find a solution that works for both. However, giving her the plate might have been a harsh reaction, especially if it came across as shaming. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can compromise without causing hurt feelings.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did communicate his feelings, but the way he enforced it might have been too abrupt. Perhaps a more compassionate approach, without giving up the plate entirely, could have been better. However, the wife's repeated disregard for the boundaries might also be an issue. She might need to show more respect for his preferences.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has the right to his own food preferences and tried to address the issue peacefully. The conflict arose from differing perspectives on what's acceptable. While the author's method of giving the plate could have been better handled, his core request isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
