My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife eating off his plate when they're out to eat, which makes him uncomfortable. He's set boundaries but feels like she's not respecting them. They ended up in an argument, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear that he doesn't want his food touched because he's protective of it. He's tried to communicate his feelings by allowing small bites but when she oversteps, he gives her the plate. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, not understanding why it's such a big deal. She ended up feeling like he was making her feel like a pig when he gave her the plate, which led to the fight.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author has tried to express his feelings multiple times. However, when the conflict arose, his reaction (giving her the plate) might have been perceived as harsh or dismissive. The wife's reaction suggests she felt unappreciated or criticized for her actions. Maybe the author didn't handle the situation in the best way, but his underlying issue is about personal boundaries around food.\n\nIs it reasonable for him to want his own food to himself? Yes, that's a personal preference. People have different views on sharing food. However, the way he addressed it might have contributed to the conflict. Instead of giving her the plate, perhaps he could have calmly reiterated his boundaries without making her feel attacked. The key here is whether the author's actions were proportionate to the situation. He had already communicated his preferences, but his reaction might not have been the most constructive approach.\n\nThe wife's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, but she might have good intentions, thinking it's a way to bond. The author's problem isn't the act itself but the lack of respect for his personal boundaries. Neither side is entirely in the wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he was clear about his preferences and the wife kept eating off his plate despite that, he was within his rights to enforce his boundaries. However, the way he enforced them might have been problematic. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on who had the more reasonable behavior. The author's core issue is valid, but his handling of the situation could be improved. However, the wife's repeated disregard for his boundaries is also an issue. It's a mutual problem. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong because he's standing by his boundaries. But if his method of enforcing them caused unnecessary harm, maybe he's part of the problem. Hmm. This is tricky. The initial question was whether he's in the wrong. The user thought he is, but I'm leaning towards him not being in the wrong because he's standing up for his preferences, even if the communication could be better. So answer B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
