My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main issue is the wife taking food from the husband's plate when they order different dishes. The husband is uncomfortable with this and has tried to set boundaries, even offering to pay for her to have her own meal if she wants to try it. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, but the husband finds it annoying and feels it affects their dining experience negatively.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sharing food can be seen as a sign of intimacy or playfulness in some cultures. However, when it's about individual plates, especially when they've ordered different items, it's common for people to expect their food to be personal. The wife's actions might be crossing a boundary the husband has, even if he's usually accommodating. The husband's request to not have his food taken is about respecting his personal preferences and boundaries.\n\nThe husband has communicated his discomfort multiple times and offered solutions, like allowing a few bites and paying for her to have her own meal next time. If the wife is still taking more than that, it's a matter of respect for the husband's wishes. The fight arose when the husband gave her the plate, which she took as being insulted, but he was trying to enforce his boundary again. \n\nIt's possible that the wife's actions are more about habit or not understanding the husband's specific sensitivity. The husband's approach to setting boundaries is reasonable, and the issue might be the wife not respecting those boundaries after being asked. The husband isn't wrong for wanting his own food to himself, especially when he's communicated this. The problem might be in how the wife is reacting to the boundary, rather than the husband setting it. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the husband isn't in the wrong for asking his wife to stop. He's expressing his preference and trying to find a compromise. The wife might need to adjust her behavior if it's causing distress. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
