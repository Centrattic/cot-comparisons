My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The question is between A (yes) and B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is upset that his wife keeps taking food from his plate when they eat out. He's protective of his food, and even though he allows a couple of bites, he's frustrated because she takes a lot, leading to him being half-full. He's tried setting boundaries, but she doesn't respect them. The latest incident led to a fight where he gave her his plate, which upset her. Now she's mad and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the wife might see it as playful and a way to bond, but the husband clearly states that he dislikes this. Food sharing can be a personal preference. Some people are okay with it, others not so much. The husband is trying to communicate his boundaries and even offers solutions like ordering extra or paying for her to have her own. The wife's actions are making the husband uncomfortable, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If the husband has communicated his discomfort multiple times and the wife continues, it's possible she isn't respecting his needs. However, the husband's reaction of giving her the plate might have been confrontational. He could have handled it differently, maybe by calmly removing his plate or not engaging in the situation. But the core issue is his right to have his own food without interference. \n\nThe wife's argument that he made her feel like a pig is a bit ironic, but she's also not respecting his boundaries. The husband's actions were trying to enforce his limits, which is valid. The fact that she's now upset might be because she didn't expect him to be so firm, but he's entitled to his preferences. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to maintain his boundaries despite the wife's actions. The problem might be in how he handled the last situation, but the main issue is the wife not respecting his wishes. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
