My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the wife eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The author is frustrated because he's protective of his food and doesn't want her to take bites from his plate. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she keeps taking more, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he owns his own food when they order separately, and he's not comfortable sharing it beyond a few bites. He's communicated his feelings multiple times and even offered to pay for her to get her own meal if she likes his dish. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, maybe not realizing how much it's bothering him. She might feel that sharing food is a way to bond or be affectionate, and she's upset when he gives her the plate, thinking it's an insult.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's clearly expressed his discomfort and tried to set boundaries. He's even suggested alternative solutions. The problem is that the wife isn't respecting those boundaries, but the author isn't wrong for wanting his own food. People have different preferences; some might find sharing food normal, others not. Since he's communicated his stance and the issue arises from her not adhering to his boundaries, the fault isn't entirely on him. However, maybe he could have handled the situation differently, like being more understanding or finding other ways to bond, but the core issue is about differing expectations. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
