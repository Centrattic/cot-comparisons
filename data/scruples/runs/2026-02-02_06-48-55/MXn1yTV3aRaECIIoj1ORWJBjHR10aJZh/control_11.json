My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clearly uncomfortable with his wife eating his food when they go out. He's protective of his meal, wants to enjoy his own food, and this has led to arguments. He's tried setting boundaries but she isn't respecting them. She sees it as playful, but he sees it as intrusive. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's communicating his needs. He's even offered solutions like ordering her the same thing if she likes it. But she continues, which makes him feel his meal is being taken from him. When he finally gives her the plate, it causes a fight. \n\nOn the wife's side, she might see it as a way to bond or share, but she's not respecting his boundaries. The author is setting limits, which is important in any relationship. If someone consistently disrespects your boundaries, that's a problem. \n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it differently. Yelling or giving her the plate might have been a harsh reaction. However, the core issue is about respecting personal space and autonomy. The author has a right to his own meal. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to explain multiple times, but she didn't comply. The wife's reaction of feeling judged when he asked her to stop seems unfair. The author isn't wrong for standing up for his needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to set boundaries, which is healthy. The problem might be more on the wife's side not respecting those boundaries, but the question is about the author. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
