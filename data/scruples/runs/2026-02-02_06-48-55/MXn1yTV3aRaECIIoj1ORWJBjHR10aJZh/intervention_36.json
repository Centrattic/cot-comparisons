My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation is that the wife keeps taking bites from his meal when they eat out, which he finds annoying and leads to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband feels that when he orders something, it's his plate, and he's not comfortable sharing. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a few bites and offering to order more for her, but she continues. The wife sees it as playful and cute, and she's upset when he enforces his boundaries, leading to a fight where she feels targeted for eating.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate if that's the case. From a boundary standpoint, the husband is within his right to set limits on his personal space and belongings, including his food. Eating off someone's plate isn't a universal norm, and people have different comfort levels. The husband's discomfort is valid. However, the way he handled it might be problematic. Giving her the plate and calling her a pig could be seen as harsh, especially if he's frustrated. The wife's actions might be playful, but the husband is trying to communicate his needs. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband is in the wrong for asserting his boundaries. Since he's made his feelings clear and the wife isn't respecting them, he's justified in trying to enforce his limits. The conflict arises because the wife's actions are intrusive to him, even if she's not malicious. So the husband isn't in the wrong for asking her to stop. However, his response (giving her the plate in a confrontational way) could have been handled better. But the question is about the initial act of asking her to stop, which is his right. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
