My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband being upset that his wife eats off his plate when they eat out. He's clear that he's protective of his food and doesn't like her eating from his plate beyond maybe a couple of bites. They've tried solutions, but she keeps doing it, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the husband is in the wrong. The key points are about boundaries and mutual respect. The wife is eating from his plate, which he finds disrespectful to his personal space and preferences. He's tried to communicate his boundaries and offered alternatives, like ordering her a separate plate if she likes his food. However, she continues the behavior, which he says makes him feel like he's competing for his own food. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If the husband has clearly communicated his discomfort and the wife isn't respecting that, then the issue is on her. The husband is trying to find solutions and compromise, but the wife's actions are disregarding his feelings. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the wife is just being playful and not malicious. But the husband's feelings are valid. Consistent disregard for someone's boundaries can be a problem. The fact that they had a fight and now she's reluctant to go out to eat anymore could indicate that the wife is reacting negatively to being asked to respect his boundary. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the side that's causing the problem by not respecting the other's feelings is usually in the wrong. The husband is not overreacting if this is a consistent issue. The wife's actions are the ones that are violating his personal space and preferences. Therefore, the author (husband) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
