My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation is that the wife takes bites from his plate when they order different things, which really bugs him. He's tried setting boundaries, but she doesn't respect them, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is expressing his discomfort and feeling disrespected when his wife takes his food without permission. He's clear about his boundaries and even offers solutions like paying for her to get her own. But she continues, making him feel like he's not getting to enjoy his meal. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see this as a playful or bonding moment. However, the key here is consent and respect for personal boundaries. Even if the wife finds it cute, the author has made it clear this behavior is not acceptable. The fact that he's been consistent in communicating his needs and she still does it suggests she's not respecting his boundaries.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014giving her the plate when she oversteps\u2014could be seen as a last resort to enforce his limits. While it might have come off as confrontational, he was trying to make a point. The wife's reaction, feeling like a pig, seems like a misinterpretation of the situation. The author isn't judging her for eating, but for taking without permission.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to eat his own food. The wife's insistence on eating off his plate despite his clear objections is the main issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. He's tried to be understanding and offered alternatives, but his needs are valid.\n"
