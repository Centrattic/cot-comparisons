My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clearly frustrated because his wife keeps eating his food even after he's asked her to stop. He feels it's his own meal, and he's protective of it. He's tried to set boundaries, offering to pay for her to get her own plate if she likes his food. But she doesn't comply, leading to a fight.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's asserting his right to his own food. He's communicated his feelings and tried compromises. He's even offered to cover the cost for her to have her own meal. The problem arises when the wife doesn't respect these boundaries, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see sharing food as a way to bond, something playful and affectionate. She might not realize how much it bothers him. When he gives her the plate, she feels criticized, leading to her feeling like a pig. This reaction suggests that she perceives his actions as a personal attack rather than a boundary issue.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But does he have a valid case? Sharing food is common in many cultures and relationships as a sign of closeness. However, personal boundaries vary. The author has the right to his own space and belongings, including his meal when it's ordered separately. He's made his feelings clear, so the responsibility also lies with the wife to respect that.\n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it differently. Instead of giving her the plate in a confrontational way, he could have calmly reiterated his request without escalating the situation. However, the main issue here is about mutual respect for boundaries. The wife isn't respecting his boundary, so the author isn't wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. He's communicated his needs and tried to find solutions. The wife's actions are the main issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
