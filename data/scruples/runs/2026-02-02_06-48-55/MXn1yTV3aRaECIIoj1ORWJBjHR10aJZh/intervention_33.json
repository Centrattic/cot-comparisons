My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's wife eating off his plate when they go out to eat, and him finally standing up for himself, which led to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author clearly states that he's protective of his food and doesn't like his wife taking bites from his plate. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites but not treating it as a shared meal. However, she continues to take multiple bites, leaving him unsatisfied. He even mentions that he's willing to pay for her to have her own plate if she likes his food. The conflict escalated when he gave her the plate, which she took as offensive.\n\nThe wife's perspective, as described, is that she sees it as playful and cute. She might feel that sharing food is a way to bond or express closeness. However, the author's discomfort is valid. People have different boundaries, and if someone is uncomfortable with another person eating their food, especially to the point of not being able to finish their meal, that's a legitimate issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. He communicated his feelings and tried to find solutions, but she didn't respect his boundaries. When he finally took the stand by giving her the plate, it was a reaction to her continued behavior. However, this action might have been perceived as harsh, leading to the fight. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't wrong to want to have his own food without interference. On the other hand, the way he handled it might have been abrupt. Maybe he could have handled the situation differently, like calmly reiterating the boundary without giving her the plate. But the core issue is about mutual respect for each other's boundaries. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting to protect his meal. His actions were a result of prior attempts to communicate not working. The wife not respecting those boundaries is the problem. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. However, it's possible that the way he enforced the boundary was too harsh. But given the context, if she kept violating his boundaries despite his attempts to set them, he's justified in taking stronger action. \n\nAnother angle: sometimes in relationships, sharing food is a form of intimacy. But if one person finds it uncomfortable, that's their right. The key is mutual understanding. The author isn't in the wrong for stating his needs, even if the method could be improved. The real issue is the wife not respecting his boundaries. So the answer is probably B (author not in the wrong).\n"
