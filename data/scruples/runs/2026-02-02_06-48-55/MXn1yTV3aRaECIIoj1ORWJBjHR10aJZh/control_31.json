My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is clearly uncomfortable with his wife sharing his food. He mentions being very protective of his food, using a Friends reference which implies a known joke about Monica being protective of her food. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she keeps taking more. This causes him to feel like he's competing for his own food and ends up only half-full. The situation escalated into a fight.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. She might not realize how much it's bothering him. She might value the bonding aspect of sharing food, which is common in some cultures or relationships. When the author gave her the plate, she felt insulted, thinking he made her feel like a pig. That's a miscommunication. She might feel that he's being overly sensitive.\n\nNow, boundaries in relationships are important. The author has a right to his personal space and belongings, including his meal when he paid for it. He's tried to communicate his feelings multiple times, which shows he's making an effort. However, maybe his approach could be more empathetic. For example, giving her the plate might have been a harsh reaction. Instead, he could have calmly reiterated his boundaries without making her feel attacked.\n\nThe wife's actions, while perhaps meant to be friendly, are crossing a boundary the author has set. She needs to respect his wishes once they're clearly communicated. It's about mutual respect. If she continues despite his requests, she's at fault. But the author could also work on expressing his needs without escalating the situation.\n\nSo, considering that the author has communicated his boundaries and the wife is not respecting them, the fault isn't entirely on the author. However, his reaction (giving her the plate) might have been an overreaction. But overall, he's not wrong for standing up for his boundaries. The main issue is her not respecting them after being told. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
