My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset with his wife for eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The author has tried to set boundaries, but the wife continues the behavior, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly states that he's protective of his food and finds his wife's actions annoying. He's communicated his preferences and tried to find solutions, like offering to pay for her to get her own plate. However, the wife still takes from his plate, which makes him feel like he's not getting the full meal he paid for. This has led to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see this as a playful or affectionate gesture. Sharing food can be a way of bonding for some people. She might not realize how much it bothers him. The fight happened when he gave her the plate, which she took as being judged or accused of overeating. She might feel that he's being overly controlling or not appreciating her actions as a sign of closeness.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author has communicated his boundaries, but the wife isn't respecting them. However, the way he handled the situation\u2014giving her the plate during the argument\u2014might have come off as confrontational, which could have escalated the fight. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to listen and adjust. The author's frustration is valid if he's consistently not getting the food he ordered. However, the approach to resolving it might need to be more collaborative. Maybe using \"I\" statements to express his feelings without making her feel attacked. The wife's refusal to respect the boundary despite multiple requests could indicate she's not taking his feelings seriously enough. \n\nOn the flip side, if the author's reaction was too harsh (like giving her the plate in a way that made her feel criticized), that could be his fault. Timing and method of communication matter. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's standing up for his needs. However, there's room for improvement in how he communicates. The wife's actions are also problematic if she's not respecting his boundaries after being asked. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and he did take steps to address it before, the answer leans towards B (No). The main issue is mutual understanding and adjusting communication strategies, not necessarily that one person is entirely at fault. However, some might argue that the author could be more flexible, but given the context, his stance seems reasonable.\n"
