My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them asking their wife to stop eating off their plate when they go out to eat. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is clearly bothered by his wife eating off his plate when they order different things. He mentions being protective of his food, referencing the Friends episode where Joey says \"I'm very particular about my food.\" He's tried to set boundaries, allowing her a couple of bites but not treating it as a shared meal. However, she keeps taking more, leading to a fight where he gave her his plate, which upset her. Now she's mad and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The author feels that when you order your own plate, it's your own food, and he doesn't want to share it. His wife sees it as playful and maybe a way to bond, even if she's been told not to. The key points are consent and boundaries. The author has communicated his discomfort multiple times, but she's not respecting that. On the other hand, maybe the wife didn't realize how much it was affecting him, or she might feel it's a way to connect.\n\nThe author's actions led to a fight. When he gave her his plate, that might have been a misstep. Instead of giving up his food, maybe he could have enforced the boundaries without escalating. But his main issue is about his personal space and food preferences. Food sharing can be a cultural or personal thing. In some contexts, sharing food is a bonding experience. However, if one person is uncomfortable with it, the other should respect that.\n\nThe wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling, but if he's expressed his feelings calmly and she's continued despite that, she's not respecting his boundaries. The author's frustration is valid if his needs aren't being met. However, the way he handled the situation (giving her the plate) might have been confrontational. The wife's reaction could stem from feeling criticized for her actions.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author tried to find solutions, like paying for her to order what he had. If she still doesn't comply, maybe there's a deeper issue. But the core question is whether he's in the wrong for asserting his boundaries. Since he's communicated his feelings and she's not respecting them, he's not in the wrong. The issue is more about her not respecting his boundaries rather than him being at fault.\n"
