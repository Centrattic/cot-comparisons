My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is at fault for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The author explains that he's very protective of his food and doesn't like it when she shares his plate, leading to arguments. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, and the author's request made her feel like a pig.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a clear boundary about his food being his own. He's communicated this multiple times, even offering solutions like paying for her to get what he ordered. But his wife continues to do it, which makes him feel like he's not getting to enjoy his meal fully. He ended up giving her his plate, which led to a fight. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that she sees this as affectionate or playful. She might not realize how much this behavior is bothering him. When he took away the plate, she felt judged or criticized, hence the reaction about feeling like a pig. \n\nFrom the author's point of view, he's been consistent in his requests and tried to compromise. The problem is her not respecting his boundaries despite his efforts. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the author is being overly controlling or not flexible enough. \n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships, sharing food can be a sign of intimacy for some couples. However, boundaries are also important. The key here is whether the author's request is unreasonable. He's not asking her to stop eating his food entirely but to limit it to a few bites and to not treat his meal as shared. \n\nThe author's action of giving her the plate might have been a mistake because it could have been perceived as a confrontation. Maybe a better approach would be to calmly express his feelings again without taking the plate away. However, the main issue is that the wife isn't respecting his established boundaries after multiple discussions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wife is the one continuing to eat his food despite his clear communication. The author is within his rights to want his food to himself. While the wife's actions might be well-intentioned, they are causing distress. The author is trying to find a middle ground but his wife isn't cooperating, leading to conflict. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The mistake might have been in how he handled the situation during the fight, but his initial request is valid. The wife is the one not respecting his wishes, so the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
