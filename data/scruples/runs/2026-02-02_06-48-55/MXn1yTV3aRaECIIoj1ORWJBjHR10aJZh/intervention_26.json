My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the wife eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The author is clearly upset about this and has tried to set boundaries, but the wife isn't respecting them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: he feels protective of his food, doesn't want her to take more than a couple bites, and is okay with paying for her to get her own plate if she likes what he orders. He's tried communicating this multiple times but it's still an issue. When he finally gives her the plate to stop her from taking his food, it leads to a fight. He's frustrated because he ends up not getting to eat his meal properly.\n\nNow the wife's perspective: she sees it as playful and cute. She might be doing it because she likes his food, maybe she's not as hungry, or perhaps she's trying to bond. But she's not respecting his boundaries once he's clearly communicated them. The problem is that the author has already set limits (a couple bites) and offered solutions (paying for her own plate), but she's overstepping those each time. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did communicate his boundaries, and if the wife is still crossing them, that's a problem. However, the way he handled it in the last incident\u2014giving her the plate and ending up in a fight\u2014might have been a harsh reaction. Maybe he could have handled it differently, but the main issue is that his wife isn't respecting his established boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. The wife is the one not respecting them despite the communication. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
