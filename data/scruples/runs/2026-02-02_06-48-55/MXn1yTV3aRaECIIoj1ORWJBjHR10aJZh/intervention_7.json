My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his wife to stop eating off his plate. So the situation is that they go out to eat, order different dishes, and the wife eats from his plate. The author is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author says he's protective of his food and finds it annoying when she does this. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a few bites, but she keeps taking more. He ends up not getting to eat all his meal, which is frustrating. He even says he's willing to pay for her to get the same thing, but she doesn't take him up on it. Then, when he gives her his plate to stop her from eating it, she gets mad and there's a fight.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. Maybe she doesn't realize how much it's bothering him. She might be used to sharing food, especially in a romantic way. The author is asking if he's in the wrong, but the user initially says they think he is. But I need to decide based on the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did communicate his feelings and tried to find a solution. He's clear about his boundaries. The wife, however, is not respecting those boundaries despite his attempts to explain. The problem here is that the wife's actions are causing distress, and the author is trying to set limits. But maybe the author could have approached it differently, like finding alternative ways to bond instead of being rigid. However, the key is that the author is standing up for his own needs. If someone keeps taking your food despite being told, isn't it reasonable to protect your own meal? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife feels that sharing food is a way to connect, and the author is rejecting that gesture. But the author isn't against sharing in general, just not his own meal. He's okay with communal items like chips, but not individual plates. So it's a personal preference. The author isn't doing anything wrong by asserting his own boundaries. The wife isn't respecting those boundaries, but the fault isn't on the author for trying to protect his food. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's communicating his needs and trying to find a solution. The issue is that the wife isn't respecting his boundaries, not the author setting them. So he's not in the wrong for asking her to stop.\n"
