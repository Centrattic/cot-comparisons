My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their wife to stop taking food from his plate when they eat out. The author is very protective of their food, and the wife keeps taking bites from his plate, even after he's tried setting boundaries.\n\nSo first, I need to understand both sides. The author's main issue is that he doesn't want his wife eating off his plate when they order different meals. He's offered to pay for her to get her own if she wants to try his food, but she ignores this and keeps taking from his plate. This leads to him feeling like he's losing half his meal and ends up in a fight.\n\nThe wife's side, from what little is given, is that she sees it as playful and cute. She might not realize how much it's bothering him. The author tried to compromise by allowing a bite or two, but she goes beyond that. When he finally takes his plate away, she gets upset and accuses him of making her feel like a pig.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate whether the author is being unreasonable. The key points here are about personal boundaries and communication. The author has communicated their discomfort multiple times, tried to find solutions, but the wife isn't respecting those boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. If the wife continues to take food despite being asked, that's a problem. However, the author's method of giving her the plate might have been seen as confrontational. Maybe a better approach would be to calmly reinforce the boundary without escalating the situation. But the fact remains that the wife isn't respecting his wishes, which is a valid issue.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently. For example, not giving her the plate but instead calmly stating that he's uncomfortable and that she needs to respect his plate. However, the main issue is the wife's repeated actions despite clear communication. \n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his boundaries. The wife is the one not respecting them. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
