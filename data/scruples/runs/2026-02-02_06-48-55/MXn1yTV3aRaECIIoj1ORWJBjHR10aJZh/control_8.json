My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who's upset because his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He's tried to set boundaries, but she doesn't respect them, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband clearly communicates his discomfort and has tried to find solutions, like allowing a couple bites and offering to order for her. He emphasizes that he doesn't mind her eating her own food but is against sharing his plate. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, but she ends up taking more than a few bites, leading to him feeling deprived.\n\nFrom a perspective of personal boundaries, the husband has a right to his own food. People have different levels of comfort with sharing, and if someone is uncomfortable, their feelings are valid. The wife's actions, while maybe coming from a place of wanting to bond or try different dishes, are crossing a boundary he's set. The fact that he's tried to explain and propose alternatives suggests he's not unreasonable. However, the wife's response to the conflict\u2014feeling judged and not wanting to eat out anymore\u2014might indicate she's defensive about the situation.\n\nBut is the husband wrong? Well, he's not doing anything actively harmful. He's expressing his needs and setting a boundary. The problem arises when the wife doesn't respect those boundaries, not necessarily because the husband is being wrong. The question is whether he's at fault. The wife's actions are the issue here, but maybe the husband could have handled the confrontation differently? For example, he gave her the plate, which made her feel like a pig. Maybe a better approach would be to stay firm without making her feel accused. But does that mean he's in the wrong? Not necessarily. He's standing up for his needs, which is important in a relationship. The wife's lack of respect for his boundaries is the root problem.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's justified in setting his boundaries, and the issue lies with the wife not respecting them. However, there's room for both to communicate better. But the question is if the author is in the wrong, and based on the information provided, he's not. His actions are about respecting his own preferences, which is valid.\n"
