My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband feels protective of his own food when they eat out. He orders different things, and his wife keeps eating from his plate, which he finds annoying. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she continues, leading to a fight. He says he ends up eating less because she's taking food from his plate, and he wants to share the experience but in a way that he can enjoy his own meal.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife seems to see it as playful and doesn't understand why he's making a big deal. She took the plate when he asked her not to, which upset her. Now she's angry and not wanting to eat out anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The husband is asserting his right to his own food, which is reasonable. People have different comfort levels with sharing. The wife, however, might not realize how much this is bothering him, even though he tried to explain it multiple times. But when he gave her the plate, that action might have been misinterpreted as him being rude, making her feel insulted. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his own preferences, which is valid. However, the way he reacted (giving her the plate) might have been harsh, especially if it was done in a confrontational manner. Maybe there's a communication breakdown here. He tried to explain before, but she didn't adjust. Giving the plate could be seen as an ultimatum, which might not be the best approach. But the core issue is her actions versus his boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's preferences is important. If he's communicated his boundaries clearly and she still continues, then she might be the one not respecting his wishes. But the husband's reaction could have been perceived as harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's the one asking for his own space with his food, which is a personal boundary, I think he's not in the wrong. The wife is not respecting his boundary, so she's the one at fault. The husband is justified in setting that boundary, even if his method of enforcing it could be improved.\n"
