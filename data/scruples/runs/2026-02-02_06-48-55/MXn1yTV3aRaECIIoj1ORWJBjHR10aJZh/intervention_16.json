My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author explains that he's very protective of his food when they go out to eat. His wife eats off his plate when they order different things, which he finds annoying. He's tried setting boundaries\u2014like allowing her a couple of bites\u2014but she keeps taking more. He even offers to pay for her to get her own meal if she likes his dish. The issue escalates to a fight where he gives her his plate, making her feel like a pig, and now she's upset and doesn't want to eat out anymore.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points. The wife's action is eating off his plate without permission, which he finds unacceptable. He has communicated his boundaries multiple times, but she continues. The conflict arises when she doesn't respect his limits, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's been clear about what he's willing to accept (a couple of bites) and has offered solutions. The problem is that the wife isn't respecting those boundaries. He's taking action to protect his own meal, which he paid for. Food sharing in some contexts is common, but the author draws the line at having his own plate taken from him. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. She might feel that sharing food is a way to bond, and the author's insistence on keeping it separate is making her feel judged. When he gives her the plate, she interprets it as him making her feel like a pig, which is ironic because he's the one upset about her actions. The fight leads to her not wanting to eat out anymore, which suggests that her feelings are hurt.\n\nNow, whose side is the right one? Boundaries in relationships are important. If the author has clearly communicated his discomfort and the wife continues despite those boundaries, she might be the one in the wrong. However, the way the author handled the situation (giving her the plate) might have been confrontational and hurtful, even if his intention was to enforce his boundaries. The wife's reaction suggests that his approach was not effective and may have been perceived as harsh.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about the act of asking her to stop eating off his plate. The author's actions are a response to her not respecting his boundaries. However, his method of resolving it (giving her the plate) led to a fight. Maybe he should have handled it differently, but the act of setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. \n\nThe wife's behavior is the initial problem\u2014taking food from his plate without consent. The author is trying to correct that. However, his approach might have been too abrupt, leading to conflict. So, while both parties have valid points, the author's main issue is about his right to his own food, which isn't unreasonable. The wife's continued disregard for his boundaries is the root of the problem.\n\nBut the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Maybe they see the wife's actions as playful and the author overreacting. But given that the author has been clear and the wife isn't respecting that, he's justified in setting boundaries. The problem is in how the conflict was resolved, not the initial act of asking her to stop. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, even if the resolution could have been smoother.\n"
