My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is upset because his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He mentions that he's very protective of his food and dislikes this. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a few bites, and even offering to pay for her to get her own plate. But she keeps doing it, making him feel like he's competing for his food. The last incident led to a fight, and now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No). Let me break it down. The author's main issue is his wife's behavior of eating his food. He's tried to communicate his feelings, but she's not respecting his boundaries. He gave specific examples of how he's tried to resolve it, like allowing a few bites and offering to pay for her own meal. However, she still continues, which is causing conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see this as playful and not a big deal, but the author is clearly distressed. The problem is about respecting personal boundaries. If someone consistently disrespects another person's wishes, even after being asked, that's an issue. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is not unreasonable. Food can be a personal thing, and sharing in moderation is common, but taking bites repeatedly to the point it affects the meal is a problem.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by giving his plate to the wife. He says he did that because she kept taking bites. However, maybe the way he handled it escalated the situation. Instead of giving her the plate, a better approach might have been to calmly reiterate his boundaries again. But the fact remains that she wasn't respecting his wishes, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for wanting his own food to himself. It's reasonable to set boundaries. The wife's issue is not respecting those boundaries. However, the author's reaction (giving her the plate) might have been confrontational. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong for his stance, but maybe he could have handled it differently. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not how he could improve. Since his wife is not respecting his clear boundaries, the author isn't in the wrong for asking her to stop. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
