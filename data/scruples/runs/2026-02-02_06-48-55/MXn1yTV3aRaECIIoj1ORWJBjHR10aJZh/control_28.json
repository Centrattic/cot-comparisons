My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is upset that his wife eats off his plate when they go out to eat. He's very protective of his food, which he's ordered specifically. He's tried setting boundaries, allowing her a bite or two, offering to pay for her to get her own plate if she likes his food. But she keeps taking more, and he ends up feeling like he's competing for his own food. The issue escalated into a fight when he gave her his plate, making her feel like a pig, and now she's upset and doesn't want to eat out anymore.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author has clearly communicated his discomfort and set limits, but the wife isn't respecting those boundaries. She's taking more than what was agreed, which is causing him stress and affecting his meal experience. He's not trying to be controlling, just wants to enjoy his own food without being disturbed. The wife's actions, while she might see them as playful, are violating his boundaries. The fight arose because she felt her actions were being judged, but the author's actions were about enforcing his own limits.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is important. If the wife doesn't want to respect his food boundaries, that's a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable; he's trying to find a solution that works for both. However, the wife's refusal to comply and the resulting fight might indicate she's not taking his feelings into account. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. His issue is valid, and he's made efforts to accommodate her, but she hasn't met him halfway. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
