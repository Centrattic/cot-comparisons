My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation is that the wife takes bites from his plate when they order different things, which the author finds annoying. They ended up in a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly communicates his discomfort and has tried to set boundaries. He's even offered solutions like paying for her to get his dish if she likes it. But the wife keeps doing it, making the author feel like he's competing for his own food. The author gives examples of specific instances where this happened, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. She might not realize how much it bothers him. The fight arose when he took away the plate, which she felt was making her feel like a pig. She's now upset and doesn't want to eat out anymore. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's the one who initiated the discussion about it being an issue, but he's also trying to stand up for his needs. However, the way he handled the situation might have contributed to the conflict. Taking the plate away during dinner could have been a harsh reaction. Maybe he should have addressed it calmly instead of escalating it during the meal. \n\nBut the core issue is about personal boundaries. If someone orders their own food, they have a right to expect it's theirs. The wife's actions are infringing on that, even if she means it as playful. The author isn't wrong for wanting his food to himself. However, the method of confrontation (giving her the plate) might not have been the best approach. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The fault might lie more with the wife not respecting those boundaries and the author's reaction during the meal. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is B (No). He's justified in his feelings but could have handled the confrontation better.\n"
