My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to stop eating off his plate. The author explains that he's very protective of his food when they go out to eat. His wife takes bites from his plate, even after he's tried to set boundaries. He's offered solutions, like allowing her a couple of bites and offering to order it for her instead. But she keeps doing it, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels his personal space and ownership over his meal are being invaded. He's tried communication, but it's not working. His wife, on the other hand, might see it as a playful way to bond and shares the food as a sign of closeness. She might not realize how much it's affecting him.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author has tried to express his feelings and even proposed compromises. However, the wife's actions indicate she either isn't respecting those boundaries or doesn't see the issue. It's possible she's not aware of how much it's bothering him. The fight that ensued suggests a breakdown in communication.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? He's standing up for his personal boundaries. Being protective of one's food isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's causing stress. However, maybe he could have approached it differently, like using \"I\" statements to express his feelings without making her feel attacked. The final action of giving her the plate might have been confrontational, which could have escalated the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife shouldn't take more than a few bites if it's agreed that a bite or two is acceptable. She might be overstepping by continuously taking from his plate. The author's frustration is valid because he's not getting to enjoy his meal as intended. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, the situation might require more empathy from both sides. The wife needs to respect his boundaries, and the author might need to communicate more effectively to avoid confrontations. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No), as he's advocating for his own needs and had tried to compromise.\n"
