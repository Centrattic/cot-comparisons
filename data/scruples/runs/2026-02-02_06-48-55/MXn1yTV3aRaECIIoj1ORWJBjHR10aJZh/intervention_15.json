My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset that their wife eats off their plate when they're out to eat. The author is protective of their food and finds it frustrating, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author clearly communicates their discomfort and has tried to set boundaries, like allowing a few bites but not the entire meal. However, the wife continues to take more than agreed, leading to conflict. The author gave up their plate in a moment of frustration, which the wife took as an insult.\n\nFrom the author's side, they have a legitimate right to be upset if they paid for their own meal and want to enjoy it without interference. Food sharing can be a personal preference, and if it's causing distress, it's reasonable to set boundaries. However, the way they handled it\u2014giving up the plate during the argument\u2014might have been a mistake in communication. Instead of escalating the situation, maybe they could have calmly reiterated their feelings again.\n\nOn the wife's side, she might see sharing food as a way to bond, but she isn't respecting the author's boundaries. Even if she finds it playful, the author's feelings are valid. The wife's reaction to being called a pig is also a bit contradictory since she was the one overstepping.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, their decision to give up the plate might have been a harsh reaction. The wife's continuous disregard for the author's wishes is problematic. The key here is mutual respect: the author should express their needs clearly without aggressive actions, and the wife should respect those boundaries. Since the author was the one who communicated their feelings and tried to find solutions, they're not in the wrong. The wife's actions led to the conflict, so the author isn't at fault.\n"
