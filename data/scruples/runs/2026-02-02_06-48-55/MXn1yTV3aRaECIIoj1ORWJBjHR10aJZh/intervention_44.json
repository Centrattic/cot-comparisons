My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author is at fault for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is upset because his wife keeps eating off his plate when they order different dishes. He's protective of his food and doesn't like sharing it, even though he's okay with her having a few bites. He tried setting boundaries, but she continues, leading to a fight. Now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore. The author's main argument is that when you order your own plate, it should be yours, and sharing beyond a couple of bites is not okay. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and doesn't see the issue.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nLooking at the details, the author has communicated his boundaries multiple times. He's tried to find solutions like offering to pay for her to get her own plate if she likes his food. However, the wife isn't respecting those boundaries. The key here is about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author is asserting his right to his own food, which is a reasonable request. Food is personal, and while some people are more open to sharing, others aren't. The fact that the wife continues despite being told multiple times suggests she's not respecting his boundaries. The author's actions were to enforce what he's already communicated, which is his right. However, the conflict arose because the wife felt targeted when he took the plate away. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the author overstepped. He's standing up for his comfort level, which is valid. The wife's behavior is the main problem here, not the author's request to stop. The fight was due to her not respecting his boundaries, so the fault lies more with her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
