My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife eating off her husband's plate when they go out to eat, which is bothering him. The author, the husband, has tried to set boundaries but the wife isn't respecting them, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband is clearly upset about his wife eating his food. He values his own meal and feels it's his because he ordered it. He's tried to communicate his boundaries and even offered solutions like paying for her to get the same dish. However, the wife continues to take bites, which is causing the husband to be uncomfortable and even go home hungry sometimes.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see the act of sharing food as a way to bond and be playful. She might not realize how much it's bothering him. But the key here is communication. The husband has tried to explain his feelings and set clear boundaries. If the wife is still doing it despite those explanations, it's possible she's not respecting his boundaries, which is her fault. However, the husband's approach might come off as being too strict or not considering her perspective, especially if she's used to a different way of sharing.\n\nThe author's actions: He's being clear with his boundaries, trying to find solutions (like paying for her to get the same food), and is standing his ground when she disrespects those boundaries. The problem arises when he gives her the plate, which might have seemed abrupt, but his intention was to protect his meal. The wife's reaction suggests she feels accused, which might be due to how the boundary was enforced rather than the boundary itself.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If the husband has communicated his feelings and the wife continues to eat his food despite that, she's in the wrong. However, the husband might need to be more empathetic in his approach, perhaps finding a way to share without making her feel deprived. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's clearly expressed his needs and is trying to maintain his boundaries, it's the wife who isn't respecting them. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
