My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is upset because his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He finds it annoying and it's causing arguments. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she doesn't respect that. He ends up giving her the plate, which made her angry, and now they're fighting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider each side. The author is clearly not happy with his wife's actions. He values his own food and feels like he's not getting to eat what he ordered. On the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. She might not realize how much it's bothering him. She might see sharing food as a way to bond or be close.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about boundaries in relationships. It's important for couples to respect each other's preferences. If one person is uncomfortable with something, the other should make an effort to accommodate that. The author has communicated his feelings multiple times and tried to find solutions, like offering to order her what he has. If she still doesn't respect that, maybe the problem is on her side.\n\nBut then, when he gave her the plate, she got upset and accused him of making her feel like a pig. That reaction might be because she felt attacked or that her actions were being criticized harshly. Maybe the author's response was too direct or hurtful, leading to the fight. However, he did mention he tried to explain calmly and suggest alternatives.\n\nAnother angle: cultural or social norms. In some cultures, sharing food is a sign of affection. But the key here is mutual respect. If one person's comfort is being disregarded, the other might need to adjust. The author's issue isn't about the food itself but about ownership and personal space. If he's okay with her eating a little, but she goes overboard, that's a problem. The wife might not be aware of the extent of her actions.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's okay with her eating other people's food, just not his. That could indicate that he's being overly possessive, but maybe it's just his personal preference. It's his choice to have boundaries around his own food. However, if she's doing it playfully and he's reacting strongly, there might be a communication breakdown. But since he's already communicated his feelings and she's not respecting it, maybe it's not just about communication.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have roles. The author should express his feelings without making her feel attacked, and the wife should respect his boundaries. Since she's not respecting his boundaries despite his explanations, the main issue might be on her side. However, the author's reaction of giving her the plate might have been a bit harsh, leading to her feeling insulted. So there's some fault on both sides, but which is more significant?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife is not respecting his boundaries, he's not wrong for trying to enforce them. However, the way he enforced it (giving her the plate) might have been a poor choice, leading to conflict. But the core issue is her not respecting his wishes, so he's not entirely at fault. Therefore, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in how he handles the situation.\n"
