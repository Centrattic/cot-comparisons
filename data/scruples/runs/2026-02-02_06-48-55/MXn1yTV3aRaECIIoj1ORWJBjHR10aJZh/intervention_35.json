My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the wife eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The author is really bothered by this and it led to a fight. He's asking if he's the a**hole for asking her to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is protective of his food. He doesn't like that she's eating his meal when they ordered different things. He's tried to set boundaries\u2014like allowing a few bites and offering to buy her the same dish. But she keeps doing it, and he ends up not being able to eat enough. He even mentions giving her the plate, which made her upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. She might not realize how much this is bothering him. Her argument is that sharing food is a bonding experience. But the author feels like he's losing his meal and that it's not a bonding activity if it's making him uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, food boundaries can be a personal thing. If someone is uncomfortable with their partner eating their food, it's reasonable to ask them to stop. The author has tried to communicate his feelings and set limits. If the wife isn't respecting those boundaries, then maybe the issue is more on her side. But the author did take it to an extreme by giving her the plate, which might have been a harsh reaction. However, his main issue is valid\u2014owning the food he paid for and not wanting to share.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. The key points are mutual respect and communication. The author has a right to his own food, and the wife should respect that. The problem is that she's not respecting his boundaries, which is more her fault. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for asking her to stop. The answer should be B (No).\n"
