My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The situation has led to a fight, and the wife is upset now. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is very protective of his food, which he ordered specifically. He's okay with a bite or two but not treating his plate as shared. The wife, on the other hand, does this regularly, finds it playful, and now feels accused when he offers her the plate or sets boundaries.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, people have different boundaries. The wife's actions are inconsiderate because she's taking more than a bite and it's affecting the author's meal. But the author's approach\u2014giving her the plate and having a big fight\u2014might have been harsh. He tried to set clear rules (bite or two, pay for her next meal if she likes it), but she didn't respect that. \n\nHowever, when the wife took multiple bites and he gave her the plate, she might have felt embarrassed or attacked. The author's solution of giving the plate away could have made her feel like she's being judged for eating, hence her feeling like a pig. He should have handled the situation more calmly and maybe found another way to enforce his boundaries without escalating to a fight. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect in the relationship and how each person communicates their needs. The wife isn't respecting his boundaries, but the author's reaction might have been too strong. There's a balance here. He's not wrong to want to protect his food, but the way he handled the fight might have been part of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to listen to each other's concerns. The author did try to explain his feelings multiple times, but the wife didn't comply. However, the fight resolution might have been his fault for giving in and then being confrontational. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The wife is overstepping, but his method of enforcing them could have been better. Therefore, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
