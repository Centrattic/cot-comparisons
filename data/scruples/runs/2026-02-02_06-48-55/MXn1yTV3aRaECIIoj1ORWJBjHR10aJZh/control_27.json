My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong regarding their wife eating off their plate. The author clearly states that they're uncomfortable with this and it's causing fights.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries. The author mentions being protective of their food, which is their personal choice. They've tried explaining and setting boundaries, like allowing a few bites but not the whole meal. The wife, however, continues to take more, which the author finds disrespectful to their own meal choice.\n\nThe author has communicated their feelings multiple times. That's important because in relationships, communication is key. If the wife isn't respecting the boundaries after repeated discussions, maybe there's a deeper issue in how they're handling the situation. The wife's reaction to the fight seems to be that she feels accused, but the author's action of giving up the plate might have been a way to stop the argument, not to shame her.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled the situation differently. Instead of giving up the plate, which might have felt like an ultimatum, they could have tried another approach, like suggesting separate meals or finding a compromise. But the core issue is about the wife not respecting the author's boundaries despite being told. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The wife not respecting those boundaries is her issue. The key point is mutual respect in a relationship. If one partner's actions consistently disregard the other's feelings, that's a problem. The author has tried solutions and it's leading to conflict, which might indicate a need for more discussion or understanding from the wife. But the author's stance is valid. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
