My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting his wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He's asked her to stop, but she keeps doing it, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author clearly states that he's uncomfortable with his wife eating his food, especially when he's ordered something specific. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a few bites and offering to order for her instead. The wife, on the other hand, seems to view this as playful and not a big deal. The fact that they ended up in a fight suggests there's a communication issue here.\n\nI should think about whether the author's reaction is reasonable. Food sharing can be a cultural or personal thing. Some people find it affectionate, others find it intrusive. The author is not okay with it, so he's trying to set boundaries. It's his right to feel that way. However, the wife might see it as a gesture of togetherness. But the author is the one who ends up eating less because of it, so it's affecting his experience.\n\nThe key points are: the author has communicated his feelings, tried to find compromises, and the wife hasn't respected his boundaries, leading to conflict. The wife's actions, while maybe seen as harmless by her, are causing distress to the author. So, from a personal boundary perspective, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting her to stop. However, he might need to approach the conversation differently to avoid making her feel accused. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his approach is perfect.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, the main issue is mutual respect for each other's preferences. The wife's actions are infringing on the author's personal space (his food), which he values. Therefore, the author is justified in wanting her to stop. The answer would likely be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any aspect where he might be. For example, did he give enough time to address the issue? He tried multiple times, so it's not that. The fight happened because of the issue, not because he was mean. So, he's in the right to set boundaries.\n"
