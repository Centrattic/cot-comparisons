My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the wife keeps eating off the husband's plate when they go out to eat. The husband is really bothered by this and it led to a fight. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is protective of his food, which he finds important. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a bite or two and offering to order for her instead. He's even said he's okay if she eats a lot in general, but not his specific food. The wife, on the other hand, sees this as playful and cute. She ends up eating a lot of his food, leaving him hungry. The last incident made her upset, and now she's refusing to go out to eat.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's communicated his boundaries clearly. He's offered solutions like paying for her to order the same thing. He's frustrated because his needs aren't being respected. The wife's behavior is causing him discomfort and hunger, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the wife's side, she might feel that sharing food is a way of bonding. She might not realize how much it's affecting him, especially since she's not intentionally trying to upset him. But she did act in a way that disregarded his boundaries, leading to the argument.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The husband expressed his feelings and tried to find solutions, but the wife didn't adhere to those boundaries. Even though she might not see it as a big deal, her actions have consequences. The fight escalated because the boundaries weren't respected.\n\nSo, considering that the husband made his feelings known and the wife didn't respect those boundaries, the husband isn't in the wrong. The problem lies in the wife not respecting his wishes, even after he tried to compromise. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
