My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate at restaurants.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clearly upset because his wife keeps eating from his plate, even though they ordered different things. He's explained that he's protective of his food, wants to enjoy his meal without feeling like he's sharing, and has tried to set boundaries. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute and seems to not take his boundaries seriously, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, people have different boundaries. The author has communicated his discomfort and tried to find compromises, like allowing a few bites or offering to pay for her to get the same dish. He's even given specific examples of what's acceptable and what's not. The wife isn't respecting those boundaries, which is causing conflict. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to keep his own food. The issue is the wife not respecting his wishes despite multiple attempts to communicate. So the problem lies with her not following through. However, the author's response in giving her the plate might have been harsh, but the main issue is the ongoing disrespect for his boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like discussing it calmly instead of giving up his plate mid-meal, which could be seen as a confrontation. But the core issue is the wife's actions and not respecting his limits. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The wife is the one not respecting his boundaries despite being told, leading to the conflict. The author is justified in wanting to eat his meal without interference.\n"
