My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is very protective of his food when they eat out. He doesn't like that his wife takes bites from his plate, even though they order different things. He's tried setting boundaries, offering to buy her food, but she still does it. They had a fight about it, and now she's upset with him and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is at fault. From the husband's perspective, he's clearly communicating what he's comfortable with. He's even offered solutions like paying for her to get her own plate if she likes his food. He feels that when you order your own plate, it's yours, and he's not okay with her treating his meal as shared unless it's communal like chips or wings. \n\nThe wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, but the husband is genuinely stressed about it. The conflict arises because the wife isn't respecting his boundaries. Even though she says she's not hungry, she ends up eating his food. The husband gives her the plate in frustration, which makes her feel like a pig, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, boundaries in relationships are important. If one person is consistently not respecting another's boundaries, even after communication, that's a problem. The husband has tried to be reasonable and accommodating, but the wife doesn't seem to take his boundaries seriously. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about mutual respect. The husband is standing up for his needs, which is valid. The wife's actions are causing distress, which is also valid. However, since the husband has communicated his boundaries clearly and the wife is not respecting them, the fault might lie with the wife. But the user is asking if the husband is in the wrong. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to establish mutual respect and his feelings are valid. The wife is the one not respecting his boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
