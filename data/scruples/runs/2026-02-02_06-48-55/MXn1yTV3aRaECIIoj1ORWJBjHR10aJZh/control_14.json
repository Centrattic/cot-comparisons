My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for a judgment call on a situation where the husband is upset that his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the husband mentions he's very protective of his food, referencing the Friends episode where Joey says \"I'm very protective of my food.\" He's annoyed because his wife takes bites from his plate after they order different things, even though he's okay with her having a couple of bites to try. The problem arises when she keeps taking multiple bites, making him feel like he's competing for his food and leaving him only half full. He's tried setting boundaries, offering to pay for her to get her own, but she doesn't respect those boundaries. The result was a fight where he gave her the plate, which upset her, making her feel like a pig, and now she's not wanting to go out to eat anymore.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Is the husband being reasonable? He clearly communicates his discomfort and sets boundaries. He's even offered solutions like paying for her to have her own meal. The wife, on the other hand, continues to take more than the agreed-upon bites, which violates his boundaries. She seems to see it as playful and cute, but he's genuinely upset. The fight escalated when he gave her the plate, which she took as an insult.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The wife might see sharing food as a way to bond, but the husband's need to have his own food isn't unreasonable. The key point is that he's communicated his needs, and she's not respecting them, leading to conflict. However, the husband's action of giving her the plate might have been a mistake in how he handled it, but his core issue is valid. The wife's response being upset and not wanting to eat out anymore might be a reaction to feeling attacked, but the root problem is her not respecting his boundaries. \n\nSo, in terms of who's in the wrong, the wife is the one consistently violating his boundaries, even after he's tried multiple times to set them. The husband is trying to assert his needs, which is his right. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for standing up for his boundaries, even if the conflict happened. The answer should be B (No).\n"
