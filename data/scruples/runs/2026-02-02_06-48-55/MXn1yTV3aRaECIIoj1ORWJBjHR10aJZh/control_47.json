My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is clearly very uncomfortable with his wife eating from his plate. He mentions he's protective of his food, even referencing the Friends episode where Ross is annoyed by this. He's tried to set boundaries\u2014allowing a few bites but not treating it as a shared meal. Despite this, the wife continues to take more than she's allowed, leading to a fight.\n\nThe wife's perspective, as presented, is that she finds it playful and cute. She might see it as a way to bond. However, the husband feels it's intrusive and that he's not getting enough to eat. The conflict escalated when he gave her his plate, which she took as being made to feel like a pig, even though he was the one eating his own food.\n\nNow, to determine if the husband is in the wrong. The key points are consent and mutual respect. The husband has clearly communicated his boundaries. The wife, despite knowing these boundaries, continues to take more. This could be seen as a breach of trust and disrespecting his wishes. The husband is trying to protect his own meal, which is a personal preference. It's reasonable for someone to want to eat the food they ordered without it being taken from them. \n\nThe wife's actions led to a fight because she didn't respect his boundaries, even after he made it clear. The husband's response (giving up his plate) might have been a mistake in communication, but the root issue is her not respecting his limits. So, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for his own space. However, the question is about whether he's at fault. Since he's the one who initially set the boundary and she crossed it, he's not wrong for enforcing it. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Relationships require compromise. The husband could have tried different strategies to address the problem without escalating it. But according to the scenario, he did try to set clear limits. The wife's reaction might be more about feeling criticized than about the actual issue. Still, the husband's primary issue is his own boundaries being disrespected. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
