My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So the situation is about a couple where the husband is upset because his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He's tried to set boundaries, but she doesn't respect them, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband is clear that he dislikes sharing his food and has communicated his feelings. He's even offered solutions like paying for her to get the same dish. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute. The main issue here is differing personal boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The husband has expressed his discomfort multiple times, yet the wife continues the behavior. That could suggest she isn't respecting his boundaries, which might make her the one in the wrong. But the question is whether the husband is in the wrong.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author is the husband. So, if the wife isn't respecting his boundaries, then the husband isn't in the wrong. He's trying to communicate his needs. However, sometimes in relationships, even if someone's boundaries are valid, the way they're enforced can be an issue. Did the husband handle it appropriately?\n\nHe tried to compromise, setting clear rules like allowing a few bites. But the wife oversteps, taking many bites. When he gave her the plate, that might have come off as harsh. Maybe he could have handled the confrontation better. But the core issue is that the wife is not respecting his boundaries. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to feeling judged (\"made her feel like a pig\") is a problem, but that doesn't negate the husband's right to his own food. So the main issue is the wife's actions. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong.\n"
