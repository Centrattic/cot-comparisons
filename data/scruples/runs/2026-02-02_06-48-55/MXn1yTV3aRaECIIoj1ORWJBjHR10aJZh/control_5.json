My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is uncomfortable with his wife eating from his plate when they order different dishes. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a few bites, but she keeps taking more, leading to conflicts. He had a fight with her after giving her his plate because she kept taking his food. The wife feels he's making her feel like a pig, even though she's the one taking his food.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The husband has explained his feelings multiple times and even offered solutions like paying for her to get the same meal. The wife, however, doesn't seem to respect his boundaries as much as he wants. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his needs and setting clear boundaries. That's generally healthy in a relationship. The problem might be that the wife isn't respecting those boundaries, but the husband isn't at fault for trying to communicate. The wife's actions are the issue here. The husband's response, like giving her the plate, was probably a last resort after repeated issues. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. But the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Since he's trying to establish his needs and it's about personal space and property (his food), he's not wrong. The wife's behavior is problematic, but the husband's actions are about self-respect and his own comfort. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's standing up for his personal boundaries. The wife needs to adjust, but he's not wrong for doing this.\n"
