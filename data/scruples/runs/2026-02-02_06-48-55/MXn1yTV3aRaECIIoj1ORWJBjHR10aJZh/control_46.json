My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate when they go out to eat. The situation involves the wife taking bites from the author's plate, which he finds frustrating and leads to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband is clear that he dislikes others taking from his plate, especially when they've ordered different items. He's tried setting boundaries\u2014allowing a couple of bites, offering to reorder, but she continues. This has led to arguments and a recent fallout where she's now upset and avoiding dining out.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's expressing his personal preference and trying to respect his own needs. He's communicated his boundaries multiple times, so it's not like he's being abrupt. The key point here is that he's trying to maintain his own meal without interference, which is a reasonable request. People have different comfort levels with sharing food, and it's his right to set that boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees this as playful and doesn't understand why it's a problem. She might feel that sharing food is a way of bonding and that his reaction is over the top. Her actions, while well-intentioned, are infringing on his personal space and preferences. The fact that she continued despite his warnings suggests that she hasn't respected his boundaries, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nThe fight happened because the husband took a stand by giving her the plate, which she took as an insult. However, the root issue is that the wife hasn't respected his wishes, leading to the husband feeling compelled to enforce his boundaries more directly. \n\nConsidering all this, the husband isn't being unreasonable. He's communicated his needs and tried various solutions. The wife's actions, while perhaps coming from a place of affection, are crossing his boundaries. The responsibility here isn't solely on the husband; the wife should also respect his preferences. However, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Based on the information, he's acting within his rights to set and enforce personal boundaries. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
