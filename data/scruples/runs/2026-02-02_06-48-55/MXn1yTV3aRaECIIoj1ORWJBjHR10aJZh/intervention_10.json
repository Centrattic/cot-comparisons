My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The situation is that the wife takes bites from his plate when they order different things, which the author finds annoying. He's tried to set boundaries, but she keeps doing it. They ended up in a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is protective of his food, which he ordered, and feels like he's not getting enough. That seems reasonable. People have different preferences, and being protective of your own food is a common thing. On the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. Maybe she doesn't realize how much it bothers him.\n\nThe author has tried to communicate his feelings, offering to pay for her to get her own meal if she wants to try something. But she still does it. Maybe he didn't express his needs clearly enough, or she isn't respecting his boundaries. The fight happened after he gave her the plate, making her feel like a pig. That's a problem because his response might have been harsh, even if his initial request was reasonable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his own needs, which is valid. However, the way he handled the situation might have escalated the conflict. Instead of giving her the plate, which could be seen as shaming, maybe a different approach could have worked. But the core issue is her eating his food without consent. So, technically, he's not wrong for wanting her to stop. The problem might be in the communication and handling the conflict. But the main question is if he's in the wrong, not if he handled it perfectly. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
