My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is very protective of his food when they eat out. He's ordered different meals, and his wife keeps eating from his plate, even though he's offered to order her the same thing. He finds it annoying and it's led to a fight. The wife sees it as playful and cute. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, am I supposed to take sides here? Let's break it down. The key points are the husband's discomfort with his wife taking his food and the wife's perspective that it's a bonding experience. The husband has explained his feelings multiple times and tried to set boundaries, but she continues, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the husband has the right to his own food. Ordering different meals implies that each person's plate is their own. The wife's actions might be seen as a lack of respect for his boundaries, even if she means it as a gesture. However, the husband's response\u2014giving her the plate and causing a fight\u2014might have been an overreaction, especially if he's been clear about his preferences before.\n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe that the wife's actions aren't a big deal and the husband is being too rigid. However, the husband's feelings are valid. People have different sensitivities. The main issue is communication and mutual respect. If the wife can't respect his boundaries despite repeated requests, she might also be at fault. However, the husband's response could be seen as abrupt. The question is whether the husband's actions were justified.\n\nThe husband's solution of offering to order her the same meal is reasonable. The wife's continued behavior ignores his boundaries. The fight arose when he gave her the plate, which might have been a last straw. The wife's reaction of being upset about being labeled a pig is ironic but doesn't negate the husband's valid feelings. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, both need to find a middle ground. However, the husband's main request is to not have his food taken. That's a personal boundary. So, the wife is in the wrong for not respecting it. The husband's actions during the fight might not be ideal, but the core issue is about respecting boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n"
