My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they eat out. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is annoyed because his wife keeps taking bites from his plate when they order different dishes. He's very protective of his food, which he mentions in a Friends reference (probably the \"I'm not sharing my food\" one). He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites and offering to reorder, but she continues, leading to arguments. The latest incident caused a fight, and now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. So, I have to consider both sides. The author has a valid point about personal boundaries. When you order your own meal, especially when you're paying for it, it's reasonable to expect that it's yours. The wife might see it as a playful bonding moment, but the husband is genuinely uncomfortable with it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife isn't aware of how much this is bothering him. She might think it's a cute gesture or a way to connect. However, the fact that he's tried explaining it multiple times and she still does it suggests that she's dismissing his feelings. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The husband has communicated his boundaries clearly but she's not respecting them. That could mean she's in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries. However, if he's come across as controlling or too rigid, maybe that's where he could be at fault. \n\nBut the husband's main issue is about personal space and ownership of his food. It's a common thing for some people to be protective of their food, especially in public. If he's already offered compromises (like allowing a couple of bites or reordering), and she's ignoring that, then the problem lies with her not respecting his limits. \n\nThe fight that ensued might have been because of how he gave her the plate, making her feel like a pig. Maybe he could have handled it differently, but the initial request to stop isn't unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's preferences. If the wife insists on doing something that the husband finds uncomfortable, especially after clear communication, that's a problem. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The wife is not respecting his boundaries, which is why she's the one at fault here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
