My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I The Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. \n\nFirst, the context: The husband is very protective of his own food when they eat out. He orders his own meal and doesn't want his wife to take bites from it. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing a couple of bites, but she keeps taking more. This leads to arguments and him feeling deprived. The last incident escalated into a fight, and now the wife is upset and doesn't want to eat out anymore.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The husband clearly communicates his discomfort and sets boundaries. He's even offered to pay for her to get her own meal if she likes his choice. The wife, on the other hand, seems to see it as playful and not a big deal, which is causing friction. \n\nFrom a standpoint of personal boundaries, it's reasonable for someone to want to keep their own food, especially if it's a personal preference. The husband is asserting his needs here. The wife's continued disregard for his boundaries despite his clear communication suggests that the issue might lie in her not respecting those limits. \n\nHowever, relationships require compromise. The husband's rigidity might be contributing to the problem. Maybe he could explore other ways to bond during meals that don't involve the food. But given the situation, he's trying to communicate and find solutions. The wife's reaction to him giving her the plate seems disproportionate, as he was finally firm about his needs. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The problem might be more about the wife not respecting those boundaries rather than the husband enforcing them. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
