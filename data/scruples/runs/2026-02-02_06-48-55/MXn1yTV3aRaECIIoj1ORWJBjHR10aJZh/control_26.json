My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author explains that they're very protective of their food, which is a common trait. They've tried to set boundaries, allowing only a few bites and offering to reorder if the wife likes the food. However, the wife continues to take more than a bite, leading to the author giving up their meal and causing a fight. The wife feels it's playful, but the author is genuinely upset because they end up not getting to enjoy their meal.\n\nNow, considering personal boundaries. The author has clearly communicated their discomfort, but the wife isn't respecting those boundaries. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The wife's actions are crossing a line, even if she thinks it's harmless. The author isn't being unreasonable by wanting to keep their own food. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that sharing food is a way of bonding. But the key here is that the author has asked her to stop, and she's not listening. That suggests that the issue is about respect for the author's wishes. \n\nThe fight arose because the author took away the plate, making the wife feel like a pig. But the root cause is the repeated disregard for the author's boundaries. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're trying to find a solution (like reordering) but the wife isn't cooperating. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their needs after trying to compromise. The wife is the one not respecting the agreed-upon boundaries, leading to the conflict. The author's actions were a last resort when their requests were ignored.\n"
