My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the husband being upset that his wife eats off his plate when they go out to eat. He's tried to communicate his preferences, but she keeps doing it, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband clearly states that he's protective of his food and doesn't want her to take more than a bite or two. He's even offered to pay for her to have her own plate if she likes his meal. But she continues to take from his plate, which makes him feel like he's competing for his own food. The problem seems to be that she's not respecting his boundaries, even though he's tried multiple times to set them. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see this as playful or a way to bond, and she might feel that he's being overly controlling. But the husband isn't just being nitpicky; he's been clear about his limits, and she's crossing them repeatedly. The fact that he ends up only half-full because she's eating his food is a valid concern. He's paying for the meal and wants to enjoy his own food without it being taken from him.\n\nThe key points are communication and respect. The husband did communicate his feelings and even offered solutions. However, the wife didn't respect his boundaries once she agreed to them. The line \"I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off\" suggests that he tried to enforce the boundary in a moment of frustration, which might have escalated the situation. But the main issue is her not adhering to his requests despite him making them clear.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If she agreed to his solution but then continued to eat off his plate, she's at fault. However, the husband's approach in giving her the plate during the dinner might have been a harsh move, leading to the fight. But the core problem is her not respecting his request. So, while the husband could have handled the situation better, the main fault lies with the wife for not honoring his boundaries. Therefore, the author (the husband) isn't in the wrong; the wife is. The answer should be B (No).\n"
