My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The author is very protective of his food when they go out to eat, especially when they order different dishes. He gets annoyed when his wife takes bites from his plate, even though he's okay with her having a couple of bites. They had a fight about it, and now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nHmm. So, the author's perspective is that his own ordered food is his, and sharing it like that makes him feel like he's not getting enough. He tried to set boundaries and even offered to pay for her to get the same thing. But his wife sees it as playful and cute, and she's hurt by his reaction. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nWell, from a general standpoint, sharing food can be a way people bond, especially in relationships. The wife might feel that taking a bite is a gesture of closeness. However, the author is clearly uncomfortable with it, to the point where it's causing him stress and affecting his meal. It's important to respect each other's boundaries. If one person is okay with a certain behavior and the other isn't, that's a problem that needs addressing.\n\nThe author did try to communicate his feelings and set some rules, but maybe he could have done it in a more understanding way. The way he gave her the plate when she was taking too much might have been hurtful. Maybe he should have found a different way to enforce the boundary without making her feel like a pig. But the main point is that he's asking her to respect his boundary. Since consent and mutual respect are key in relationships, if he's communicated his needs clearly and she's not respecting them, then maybe the wife is at fault. However, if the way he's enforcing it is causing harm, maybe he's part of the problem.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the wife isn't respecting his requests, leading to conflict. The author's actions were to give her the plate, which she took as a personal attack. So, maybe he overreacted in that moment, but his underlying issue is valid. The question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No), because he's standing up for his own needs and trying to set boundaries, which is important in a relationship. However, the way he handled the situation could be improved. But the core issue is about his right to his own food, which is a personal preference. So he's not in the wrong; the wife isn't respecting his boundaries, so the author is justified in asking her to stop.\n"
