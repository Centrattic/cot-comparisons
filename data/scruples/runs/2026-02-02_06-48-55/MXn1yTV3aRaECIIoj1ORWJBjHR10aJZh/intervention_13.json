My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA story) is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The person thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife go out to eat, and she eats off his plate when they order different things. He's uncomfortable with this and has tried to set boundaries, like allowing a few bites but not treating it as a shared meal. He ended up giving her his plate, which led to a fight. The wife feels the author is being too strict and that he made her feel like a pig, even though she was the one eating his food.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author feels that when he orders his own plate, it's his and he doesn't want anyone taking from it beyond a small taste. His wife, on the other hand, finds it playful and doesn't see the issue. The argument arises because the wife isn't respecting his boundary, and the author is enforcing it in a way that causes conflict.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The wife is taking from his plate without his consent beyond the agreed-upon bites, which he clearly communicated. The author's request is about personal space and respecting his food as his own. However, his method of giving her the plate might have been confrontational, leading to the fight. So maybe the author's approach could have been more diplomatic, but the core issue is about respecting boundaries.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? People have different comfort levels. The author's discomfort is valid, and he has a right to ask for his boundaries to be respected. However, the way he enforced it (giving her the plate) might have been hurtful. The wife's reaction suggests she felt attacked, which the author might have avoided with a different approach.\n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he tried to communicate his boundaries and the wife continued to ignore them, leading to conflict, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, perhaps he could have handled the situation better without escalating. But the core issue is about respecting personal boundaries. The wife is violating his boundaries by eating his food beyond what he's comfortable with. So the author is in the right in setting those boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
