My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. The author is very protective of his food and finds it annoying when his wife takes multiple bites from his plate. He's tried explaining his feelings, setting boundaries, but it keeps happening, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is clear: he owns his food and doesn't want it taken without consent. He's tried to communicate his boundaries, even offering to buy her food if she wants it. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as playful and cute, and is upset when the author gives her the plate, which might have come off as confrontational.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did try to set boundaries, but maybe the method of giving the plate was not the best. It could have been perceived as a power move rather than a solution. The wife felt criticized, which led to her being defensive. It's possible that the author's approach escalated the situation. However, the wife's actions are disrespectful of the author's boundaries. The core issue is mutual respect: the author has the right to his food, and the wife needs to respect that. But the way the author handled the situation might have contributed to the fight. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. The author tried to communicate his needs but perhaps not in the most effective way. The wife's actions are the initial issue, but the author's response could have been more considerate. However, the main problem is the wife not respecting his boundaries. So, the author isn't entirely wrong, but maybe there's room for both to adjust. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the wife's actions are the main problem, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But the way he handled the situation could be improved. But the key point is that the author is asserting his right to his own food, which is valid. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
