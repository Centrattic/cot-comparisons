My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking his wife to stop eating off his plate when they go out to eat. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is clearly bothered by his wife's actions. He values his food and feels protective, even going as far as to mention being half-full because she takes from his plate. He's tried to set boundaries, like allowing a few bites if she wants to try, but she keeps going beyond that. The conflict escalated to a fight, and now she's upset with him.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife sees it as playful and cute. She's taking from his plate even when she said she wasn't hungry, which the author finds frustrating. The key points here are about shared experiences versus personal boundaries. The author wants to maintain his own meal, while the wife might be trying to bond or share the experience.\n\nNow, considering social norms, people often have different levels of comfort when it comes to sharing food. Some see it as a sign of closeness, others as a personal boundary. The author has communicated his discomfort multiple times and tried to find compromises, but it hasn't worked. The fact that she took a lot of his food despite her assurances about not wanting it might be a key point.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting these boundaries? Well, it's his food, and he has the right to feel comfortable with it. The wife, however, might feel that she's being denied a way she likes to interact during meals. The fight happened because the author took his plate away, which made her feel targeted. But given that he's consistently tried to explain and compromise, it's more about differing expectations.\n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. Since he's communicated his needs and the wife isn't respecting them, leading to a conflict, it's more about the wife not respecting his boundaries. However, the author's response of giving up the plate might have been too harsh, leading to the fight. So maybe the fault isn't entirely on one side. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn these scenarios, it's often about mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect his food and setting boundaries. His wife isn't wrong for wanting to share, but she needs to respect his boundaries. The problem isn't his for wanting to set them, but his approach might have been too abrupt. However, the main issue is her not respecting his wishes, not him setting the boundary.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He has a right to his personal space and food. The fault lies more with the wife not respecting those boundaries despite multiple communications.\n"
