My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is upset that his wife keeps eating off his plate when they go out to eat. He's tried setting boundaries, like allowing her a couple of bites, but she ignores that and ends up eating a lot of his food. He gave her the plate when she continued, which led to a fight.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's break it down. The author has clearly communicated his feelings about not wanting her to eat his food. He's even offered solutions, like ordering her his dish if she likes it. But she still takes more than agreed. The wife might feel that it's a playful gesture, but the author is genuinely distressed by it. \n\nNow, is the author wrong for setting this boundary? He has a right to his own food. The problem is that when he gave her the plate, that might have escalated the situation. Maybe he should have handled it differently, like not giving her the plate as it could be seen as an ultimatum. Also, in the fight, he might have made her feel bad, which she took as being called a pig. That could be a miscommunication. The wife, on the other hand, might not realize how much this behavior is affecting her husband. But the author did try to explain his feelings multiple times. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. However, the way he handled the situation might have contributed to the conflict. The core issue is about mutual understanding and respecting each other's feelings. The wife eating his food without respecting his limits is problematic, but the author could have found a more constructive way to enforce those limits without making her feel attacked. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's validly setting a boundary, even if the execution could be better.\n"
