My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is really bothered by his wife eating from his plate when they order different things. He's mentioned this before, setting boundaries like allowing a bite or two, maybe even paying for her to get her own if she likes it. But she keeps doing it, and he ends up not getting enough to eat. The last incident leads to an argument where he takes the plate away, and she's upset, saying he made her feel like a pig. Now she's upset and doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The author has communicated his discomfort multiple times. He's tried to offer solutions, like paying for her to get her own food if she likes his dish. But she's not respecting those boundaries, which is causing conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see this as a playful or bonding thing. She might not realize how much it's affecting him, or she could be used to it and not see it as a problem. But the author has clearly stated his limits, and she's crossed them repeatedly. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners respect each other's boundaries. If someone keeps violating those boundaries despite being asked, it's not just about the act itself but the disregard for the other person's feelings. The author is trying to maintain his own comfort with his food, which seems reasonable. He's also offering alternatives to accommodate her if she wants to share. \n\nThe wife's reaction suggests she might feel unfairly targeted, but the author's action of taking the plate was in response to her not respecting his prior requests. However, taking the plate could have been a harsh move, maybe escalating the situation. But the core issue is her repeated behavior after being asked to stop. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because he's communicated his needs and tried to find solutions, but the wife isn't respecting those. The problem lies in her not adhering to the agreed-upon boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
