My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their wife to stop eating off their plate. The author explains that they dislike this behavior and tried various solutions, but it led to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author clearly states they're protective of their food and find it annoying when their wife eats off their plate even when they've ordered different items. They set boundaries and tried compromises, like allowing a few bites or offering to pay for her to get the same dish. However, the wife continues the behavior, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the wife's side: she might see this as a playful and bonding activity. Maybe she feels it's a sign of closeness or doesn't realize how much it bothers the author. The fact that the fight happened because the author gave her the plate (which she took) might indicate that she felt disrespected or that the author was being overly controlling. The wife's reaction of being called a pig and not wanting to eat out anymore suggests that the author's actions hurt her feelings, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable. The author expressed their feelings and tried to communicate their boundaries, which is valid. They didn't just lash out without prior discussion. However, the way they might have enforced the boundary (giving up the plate) could have been perceived as harsh, especially if the wife was already doing something she felt was harmless. The author's frustration is understandable, but the resolution method might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions, while perhaps intended as playful, are consistently disregarding the partner's clear boundaries. The author's desire to enjoy their own food without interference is reasonable. The fact that the issue has been ongoing despite communication suggests that the wife isn't respecting the author's limits, which is a problem. \n\nBut the question is about who is in the wrong. The author tried to set boundaries and then acted on them when those boundaries were crossed. The wife's reaction indicates she felt the boundary was being enforced in a hurtful way. So, maybe the author's approach was too abrupt, leading to the fight. However, the author isn't wrong for having the boundary in the first place. The problem might be in how they handled the situation during the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author communicated their feelings, but perhaps could have found a middle ground. However, the wife's refusal to respect the boundary despite being told multiple times is also at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. Since the author tried to reason and compromise, and the wife continued the behavior, leading to a fight, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the author's response was too harsh, that could tip the balance. However, the initial request is valid, so maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
