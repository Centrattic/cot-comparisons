My wife does this thing where, when we go out to eat, she'll eat off my plate if we order different things. I'm very protective of my food (insert Friends reference here) and strongly dislike this. If I order pasta, she'll take her fork and literally eat off my plate as well as her own then say \"oh you can eat off mine too!\" I don't want to eat off hers, I want to eat off my own. That's why I ordered it.\n\nTo solve this, I've told her I'm alright with her having a bite or two to see if she likes what I ordered, and if she does I'll order it for her next time or send what she did order back and pay for her to get a plate of what I'm having. I've said I'd pay for anything on the menu when we go out. I've tried everything, but she simply cannot resist the urge to dig in to my scrumptious meal which means I go home half full.\n\nShe acts like it's playful and cute but it genuinely bugs me. I always end up going with half a meal and feel like I'm competing for my own food because she's taking her share which makes eating out an ordeal rather than a good time. Either that or she'll say she isn't hungry then eat mine. I've told her I wouldn't bat an eye if she devoured half a menu in front of me, I like to see her enjoy food, just not **my** food.\n\nIt's one thing to share chips, wings or communal food like that, but in my opinion if you order your own damn plate it should be yours. A bite is fine, treating each dish like a shared meal is not. \n\nYesterday she did it at dinner again. I had ordered something I was looking forward too, someone she had **tried** before, and I asked if she was 110% sure she didn't want me to order her some. Yes, she was sure. The food comes and sure enough, she starts taking bite after bite after bite of mine. \"I'm just having a little!\" she says. I ended up giving her the plate which pissed her off.\n\nWhen we went home we ended up in a fight, with her saying I made her feel like a pig (when it was her eating my food, ironically enough) by giving her the plate and asking why I make it such a big deal, and me explaining what I've explained a million times before and telling her that if it's just the bonding she likes we can do it in other ways where I'd still get to have a full meal. Now she's pissed at me and says she doesn't want to go out to eat anymore.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for asking his wife to stop eating off his plate. The key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the husband is clearly bothered by his wife taking bites from his plate when they eat out. He's given her specific boundaries\u2014like allowing a couple of bites if she wants to try his food, and offering to reorder if she likes it. He's even mentioned being willing to pay for her to have her own plate. The problem is that she continues to take more than agreed, which leads to conflict.\n\nNow, the wife's perspective: she sees it as playful and cute, and she might not realize how it's affecting him. But the husband feels his personal space and choices are being invaded, especially since he paid for his own meal and made specific choices. The fact that she sometimes says she's not hungry but then eats his food adds to his frustration.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband has tried to communicate his boundaries multiple times, but they aren't being respected. The wife, in turn, feels that the husband is overreacting or making her feel bad, which led to a fight. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The main issue is the violation of his personal boundaries. If he's consistently communicated his discomfort and she's not respecting that, then he's not in the wrong for setting those boundaries. However, the way he handled the situation (giving her the plate, which made her feel like a pig) might have escalated the conflict. But the core issue is about respecting his preferences and the financial aspect of ordering his own meal.\n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to set those boundaries. The wife is not respecting them, which is the problem. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
