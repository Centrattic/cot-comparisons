I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection. The main issue is the lack of contraception despite the author's concerns.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together over a year, both 20 years old, and living with their parents. The author wants to use condoms, but the girlfriend refuses, relying on the pull-out method and past experiences. She's against other methods like the pill or female condoms. The author feels she's being irrational and is conflicted about imposing their will on the relationship to protect both from potential pregnancy.\n\nNow, considering ethical and relationship dynamics. The author is prioritizing safety, which is reasonable. The girlfriend, while not using protection, is taking a risk that the author isn't comfortable with. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex to find a middle ground.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, both have the right to make decisions about their bodies, but also to express their boundaries. The author isn't forcing her to use protection, but is considering reducing sexual activity to avoid a situation where they might have a child they're not ready for. This seems like a reasonable compromise, especially given their age and financial situation.\n\nHowever, communication is key here. The author has already discussed the issue multiple times, and the girlfriend remains unmoved. The author's decision to reduce sex could be seen as a way to avoid conflict and ensure mutual safety. It's not necessarily wrong to prioritize one's own comfort and future in a relationship. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
