I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with his girlfriend because they're not using protection. The situation is that they're both 20, using the pull-out method, and the author wants to use condoms. The girlfriend doesn't want to, says she's never used them before and doesn't like how they feel. They argue, and the author is thinking about cutting back on sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is wrong for wanting to do this. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual agreement in a relationship. The author is concerned about potential pregnancy and doesn't want to be in a position to have kids now. The girlfriend is resistant to using any protection, which is risky. The author is trying to communicate his boundaries and safety concerns, which is important for both partners.\n\nIn relationships, especially when it comes to sexual health and protection, both partners should be on the same page. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method (pull-out) and wants to use condoms, it's reasonable for them to express that. However, the author is considering reducing or stopping sex, which could be seen as a form of withholding intimacy due to differing views. But is that wrong? If the author feels that the current arrangement is unsafe and he's not willing to take the risk, then setting boundaries might be his right. However, the approach of reducing sex without a mutual agreement could be problematic because it might not address the root issue and could lead to resentment.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she's not willing to use protection, which is her choice, but the author is not comfortable with that. They need to find a compromise. The author's intention is to protect himself from an unintended pregnancy, which is valid. But by reducing sex, is he being selfish? It depends on how it's communicated. If he's honest about his concerns and they work together to find a solution, that's better. However, if he's using the reduction in sex as a way to pressure her into changing her mind without proper discussion, that might be a problem.\n\nAlso, considering they're both young and not in a position for children, the author has a valid point about responsibility. The girlfriend's argument about past relationships and luck doesn't negate the risk. The author is right to be cautious. But the way he's handling it\u2014possibly reducing sex\u2014could be seen as a reasonable step to avoid compromising his values or safety, as long as it's done respectfully and with open communication.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to protect himself. However, the method of reducing sex without mutual agreement might not be the healthiest approach. The better path would be continued dialogue, exploring all options (like other forms of contraception if the girlfriend is open to them), and ensuring both are comfortable. So, the author isn't in the wrong for his intentions, but the action might need more collaboration.\n"
