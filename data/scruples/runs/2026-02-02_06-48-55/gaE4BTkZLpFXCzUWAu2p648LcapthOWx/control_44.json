I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20, no protection except pull-out. The guy wants to use condoms for safety, but she doesn't want to. They've had arguments about it. She says she's never used condoms before, never pregnant, and doesn't like how they feel. He feels she's being irrational. Now he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the main issue is consent and mutual agreement on sexual health. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and is trying to protect himself. He's trying to communicate his needs but she's not budging. He's thinking of reducing sex, which could be seen as a form of withholding intimacy unless there's agreement.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners should have mutual consent on sexual activities. If they can't agree on protection, does one partner have the right to stop sex? But it's also about personal boundaries and health. The author is setting boundaries to avoid pregnancy, which is reasonable. However, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a form of coercion if it's used as punishment or to force her hand. But if he's doing it to protect himself and is open to finding a compromise, maybe it's justified. \n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. If the couple can't agree, it's a conflict in values. The author is prioritizing safety, while she's prioritizing comfort. Both have valid perspectives. However, the author is trying to communicate and find a solution. If he's reducing sex to encourage her to consider protection, it's a tactic that might not be fair because it uses intimacy as leverage. Alternatively, if he's doing it to protect himself until they can agree on a method, maybe that's his right. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no clear right or wrong, but in terms of relationship dynamics, withholding sex to pressure the other might not be healthy. However, if it's about personal boundaries and health, it's different. The answer might depend on cultural or personal views. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering he's trying to protect himself, maybe the answer is B (No). He's not wrong for trying to set boundaries. But if he's using it as punishment, then A. The situation is complex, but the author is acting out of concern for safety, which is valid. So probably B.\n"
