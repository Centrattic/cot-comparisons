I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because she won't use protection. The situation involves them not using condoms, relying on the pull-out method, and the girlfriend being resistant to using them despite the author's concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and feels it's irresponsible. The girlfriend has her own reasons\u2014past experience without condoms, preference for pull-out, and discomfort with condoms. She's also against other methods like birth control. \n\nThe author is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground. The question is if that's wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. Both partners should agree on contraception. The author is trying to express his concerns, but the girlfriend isn't budging. The author feels conflicted between respecting her preferences and his own safety. \n\nLegally and ethically, neither is wrong in their stance, but the author's action to reduce sex could be seen as a way to enforce his boundaries. However, it's important to consider if this is a fair approach. Is it selfish to prioritize one's own fears over the partner's comfort, or is it responsible? \n\nThe author's intention is to avoid an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's refusal to use protection might be seen as risky, but she's also making a choice based on her comfort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's decision to reduce sex could be a way to protect himself, but it might also be a form of coercion if it's not mutual. However, since they haven't found a middle ground and they're both young, maybe the author is acting in his own interest. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's trying to address a valid concern and is seeking a compromise. It's a difficult situation, but his actions are driven by responsibility rather than selfishness. The wrong would be if he forced her to use protection without her consent, but reducing sex is a personal choice to manage risk.\n"
