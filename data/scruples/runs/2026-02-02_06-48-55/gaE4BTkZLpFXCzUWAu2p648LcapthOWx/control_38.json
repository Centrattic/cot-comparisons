I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend over the use of protection. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, and they're not in a position to have kids. The guy has tried to use condoms, but the girlfriend resists, preferring the pull-out method. She argues that she's been fine in past relationships and doesn't like how condoms feel. The guy feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the main issue is about contraception and mutual agreement. The author is concerned about potential pregnancy and is trying to protect both of them. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is resistant to using condoms and other forms of birth control. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex. The key factors here are communication, mutual consent, and health/safety. The author has tried discussing it, but there's been conflict. He's not forcing her to use condoms but is concerned about the risks. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method, it's important to find a solution that works for both. However, if one person is pushing for a method the other refuses, it can lead to tension. The author is trying to find a compromise but hasn't succeeded yet. \n\nReducing sex as a tactic might be seen as a way to pressure the girlfriend into changing her stance, which could be problematic. However, the author's intention is to reach a middle ground, not to punish her. It's about protecting both of them from an unintended pregnancy. \n\nLegally and ethically, neither can force the other to use a specific method. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect himself, but he should ensure that any changes in the relationship's intimacy are discussed openly and not as a form of punishment. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's acting in his own protection and trying to find a solution. The answer is B.\n"
