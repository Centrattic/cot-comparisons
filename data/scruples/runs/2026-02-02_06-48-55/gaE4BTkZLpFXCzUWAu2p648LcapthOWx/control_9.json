I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong if they stop or reduce having sex with their girlfriend because she refuses to use protection beyond the pull-out method. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and practical aspects here. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20 years old, and live with their parents. The author is concerned about the economic and emotional readiness for children, which is a valid point. They've tried discussing condoms before, but the girlfriend prefers not to use them due to preference and her past experience without them. She argues that the pull-out method is sufficient and that she's had no issues before, which is a common but risky argument.\n\nThe key points are consent and mutual agreement in a relationship. The author feels the need to protect themselves from an unintended pregnancy, which is a personal right. If both parties can't agree on a contraceptive method that works for both, then the author's decision to reduce or stop sex until they find a middle ground could be seen as a responsible choice. It's about prioritizing their own well-being and future, especially since they're both young and not in a position to have children.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue of communication. The author has tried discussing this, but maybe they haven't explored all options. They mentioned birth control pills and female condoms, which the girlfriend rejects. The author is considering reducing sex to pressure a change, but that might not be the healthiest approach. It could lead to resentment or a power imbalance. A better approach might be to seek counseling or explore other methods together, but if that's not possible, the author's action to protect themselves isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that the pull-out method is enough for her. She might feel that the author is suddenly being restrictive without considering her comfort. But the author has a right to express their needs, especially regarding their own reproductive choices and life plans. The problem is the lack of a mutual solution. The author isn't being coercive, just asserting their boundaries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're trying to protect themselves from a situation that could lead to an unintended pregnancy and they're not forcing their partner to use a method she's uncomfortable with, but instead adjusting their behavior to align with their own risk tolerance, then they're not in the wrong. The wrong would be if they forced the issue without mutual consent, but in this case, they're choosing to reduce sex to find a compromise. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
