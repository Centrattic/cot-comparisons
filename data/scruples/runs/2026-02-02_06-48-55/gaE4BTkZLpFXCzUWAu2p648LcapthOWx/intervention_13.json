I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who've been together over a year, both 20 years old. They're not using protection except the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms because they can't handle kids right now, but the girlfriend doesn't want to. They've had arguments about it. The author is now considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and is trying to protect both of them. That seems responsible. On the other hand, the girlfriend is against condoms and has used other methods in the past without issues. She might feel that her autonomy in the relationship is being challenged if the author imposes condom use.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual agreement, and communication. The author is trying to express their needs and boundaries, which is important. However, if the girlfriend is not willing to meet halfway and the author is considering reducing sex, does that cross a line? The author isn't threatening to stop entirely, just reduce until they find a solution. But is that a valid approach?\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel heard. The author has tried discussing it multiple times, and the girlfriend remains unmoved. The author's concern is valid, but so is the girlfriend's discomfort with condoms. Maybe the author should explore other options, like talking to a healthcare provider about better alternatives, or perhaps using other forms of contraception that the girlfriend is open to. However, the girlfriend isn't willing to consider other methods either, like the pill or female condoms.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot because they're prioritizing safety, but the girlfriend isn't. The author might feel that their needs are being ignored. However, reducing sex might not be the best approach if it's done unilaterally without mutual agreement. It's possible that the author is trying to assert control over a situation where both need to compromise. \n\nBut considering the author's age and inexperience, they might not handle this situation perfectly. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If they're trying to communicate their needs and are seeking a solution, even if it means reducing sex temporarily, but not cutting it off entirely, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the approach is dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings or autonomy, then maybe they are. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are respectful of both partners' needs. Since they're trying to find a middle ground, perhaps they're justified. But if the girlfriend's refusal is a deal-breaker for the author, then reducing sex is a reasonable step. However, it's a bit of a gray area. I think the author is trying to act responsibly, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
