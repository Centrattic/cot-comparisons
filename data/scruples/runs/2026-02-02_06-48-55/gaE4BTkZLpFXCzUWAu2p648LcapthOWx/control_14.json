I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation is that they and their girlfriend are in a one-year relationship, both 20 years old, living with their parents, and they don't use any protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to use condoms before, but the girlfriend didn't want to. Now the author is reconsidering and wants to use protection again but the girlfriend is resistant.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy, which is understandable given their age and living situation. The girlfriend, on the other hand, argues that she's never used condoms in the past and hasn't gotten pregnant, so she's not willing to do so now. She also mentions that the pull-out method is sufficient, even though it's less reliable than condoms. \n\nThe author is considering reducing or stopping sex until they can find a middle ground. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong. From a health and safety perspective, not using protection increases the risk of unintended pregnancy and STIs. The author has valid reasons for wanting to use condoms, like economic and emotional readiness for parenthood. The girlfriend's resistance could be seen as dismissing the author's concerns, even if she hasn't had issues before.\n\nHowever, relationships require mutual consent and comfort. The author is trying to communicate their needs, but if the girlfriend is unwilling and the author feels that the current method is too risky, then the author has a right to set boundaries. But is it right to stop sex entirely as a result? That's where it gets tricky. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel heard and respected. If the author stops sex without addressing the underlying issues and without considering their partner's feelings, it might be seen as a selfish move, especially if it's done to pressure her into using protection. \n\nOn the flip side, the author isn't willing to take the risk, and if the partner isn't open to other forms of birth control (like the pill or female condoms), then the author's choice to reduce intimacy until a compromise is reached is a way to protect themselves. It's important that they tried to discuss and find a solution. The author isn't forcing anything, just making a decision based on their own comfort and safety. \n\nThe problem is that using the pull-out method alone isn't reliable. The author is aware of this and is trying to mitigate the risk. The girlfriend's argument about luck is a common one but not a solid reason to ignore safer sex practices. The author's action of reducing sex might be a way to encourage dialogue without being confrontational. \n\nBut are they in the wrong? It's not a clear yes or no. The author is making a responsible choice, but the method of reducing sex could be seen as a form of punishment or manipulation. However, if they're doing it to protect their future and not out of spite, maybe not. The right answer might depend on how they approach it. If they're using it as a tactic to make the girlfriend change her mind, then it's more problematic. If they're making a personal decision to step back until a safer arrangement is possible, it's more about self-respect and responsibility. \n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's resistance and the author's valid concerns, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to prioritize their own well-being. But it's also important to handle it with care, not using sex as a weapon. The answer might be B (No), but with the caveat that communication is key. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given their reasons and the attempts to find a compromise, the answer is probably B.\n"
