I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong if they stop or reduce having sex with their girlfriend because they disagree on using protection. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents. They use the pull-out method but no condoms. The author tried to insist on condoms before, but the girlfriend didn't agree. Now the author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The author's main concern is about not being ready for kids, which is valid. They've tried discussing it, but the girlfriend is resistant. She says she's been fine without condoms before, doesn't like how they feel, and thinks the pull-out is enough. The author feels she's being irrational, but wants to avoid being selfish. So he's thinking of reducing sex to push her to find a compromise.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is wrong. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, they've had discussions and arguments. The girlfriend is not budging. The author's solution is to reduce the sex until there's a middle ground. But is that reasonable? Well, if both are in the relationship, they need to find a solution that works for both. If the author feels that the current method is too risky and he's not comfortable, he's within his rights to set boundaries. However, reducing sex might be a form of withholding affection as a consequence, which can be seen as a manipulation tactic. \n\nBut maybe the author is trying to protect both of them. If the girlfriend isn't considering the risk, the author is trying to be responsible. On the other hand, if the author stops sex, the girlfriend might feel punished or it could harm the relationship. Also, using the pull-out method without condoms is less effective than using condoms. The author's intention is to avoid pregnancy, but the girlfriend is against using protection. \n\nIn terms of rights and responsibilities in a relationship, both partners should ideally agree on contraceptive methods. If one is uncomfortable with the current method, they have the right to express that and seek a compromise. However, the author's approach of reducing sex might not be the best way to handle it. Maybe there's a better way, like seeking medical advice together or exploring other options the girlfriend is open to. But the question is if the author is in the wrong for trying this approach.\n\nI think the author is trying to protect both himself and the relationship, but the method of reducing sex might be too abrupt. However, given that they've tried discussing it multiple times without success, the author is in a tough spot. Withholding sex could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive behavior, but if it's to prevent a potential crisis (pregnancy), it's a way to prioritize his own boundaries. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because he's trying to set a boundary that's important for his well-being and future.\n"
