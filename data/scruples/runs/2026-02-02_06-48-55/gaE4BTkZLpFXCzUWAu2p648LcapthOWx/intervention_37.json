I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting on WIBTA) is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to her refusal to use protection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend is 20, and they've been together over a year. They use the pull-out method without condoms. He's concerned about not being ready for kids financially or emotionally and has tried to use condoms, but she resists. She argues she's never used condoms before, hasn't gotten pregnant, and doesn't like how they feel. They've had arguments about this, and now he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, communication, and mutual health. Condoms are a standard form of protection against pregnancy and STIs. The girlfriend is resistant, citing past relationships and personal preference. The boyfriend is worried about the risks and feels she's being irrational.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong by wanting to reduce sex. From a health and safety perspective, not using protection is a risk. However, the boyfriend is trying to address it through discussion. He's not forcing her to use something she's against but is seeking a compromise. If she's not willing to use any protection, and he's uncomfortable with the risk, then reducing sexual activity could be a responsible choice. \n\nBut is this selfish? The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe not. If both partners aren't on the same page regarding safety, it's his right to set boundaries. The problem is that he's trying to negotiate, and if she's not willing to budge, then his decision to reduce sex might be a way to respect his own boundaries without pressuring her. \n\nHowever, the other side could argue that communication is key. Maybe he should explore other methods she's open to, like the female condom or birth control, even if she's resistant now. But she's already said no to those. So if there's no middle ground, then his choice to reduce sex is about his own comfort and responsibility, not necessarily being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong because he's attempting to address a legitimate concern through communication and is trying to find a compromise without forcing his will on her. It's about mutual agreement and personal responsibility.\n"
