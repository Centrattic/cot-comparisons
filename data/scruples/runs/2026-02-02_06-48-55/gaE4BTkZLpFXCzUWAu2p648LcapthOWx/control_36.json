I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA (Would I Be A Tool for Asking) scenario is in the wrong if they reduce or stop having sex with their girlfriend over the issue of not using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The couple has been together for over a year. They are both 20, living with their parents, and not in a position to have kids. The guy wants to use condoms, but the girl refuses, using the pull-out method. She's been in a past relationship without condoms too, and she's not interested in other methods like the pill or female condoms. They argue about it, and the guy feels she's being irrational. Now he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual decision-making. The guy is concerned about unintended pregnancy and wants protection. The girl doesn't want to use condoms because of preference and past experience. The question is whether he's wrong for potentially reducing sex to enforce his preference.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to have mutual consent on such issues. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method and the other isn't budging, it's a serious conflict. The guy is trying to communicate his concerns, which is good. But is he being selfish by reducing sex? Or is he protecting his own boundaries?\n\nThe girl's stance is that she's had unprotected sex before without issues, but the guy is right that it's statistically riskier. The pull-out method isn't reliable. He's trying to find a compromise, but she's not open to alternatives. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The guy has the right to set boundaries for his own comfort and safety. However, if he reduces sex unilaterally without further discussion, it might be seen as a form of pressure. But given the stakes (unintended pregnancy), his concerns are valid. The question is whether he's in the wrong for prioritizing his own safety, even if it affects their intimacy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he should try to explore other solutions more, like maybe discussing the risks again, finding a female contraceptive method she's willing to try, or counseling. But if he's already done that and she's not budging, then reducing sex could be a last resort to protect himself.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). He's trying to address a serious issue and is looking for a solution, even if it means adjusting their relationship temporarily. His actions are based on protecting himself and avoiding a life-changing situation, which is reasonable.\n"
