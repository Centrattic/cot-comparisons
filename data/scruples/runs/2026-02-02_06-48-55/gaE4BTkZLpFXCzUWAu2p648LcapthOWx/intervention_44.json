I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they're not using protection. The main issue here is about safe sex practices and the couple's disagreement.\n\nFirst, the guy and his girlfriend have been together over a year, both are 20 and living with parents. He's concerned about not being ready for kids, economically or emotionally. He's tried suggesting condoms before, but she didn't like them and they ended up using the pull-out method. Now he's bringing it up again, and she's resistant, saying she's never used condoms before and hasn't gotten pregnant. She's not open to other methods like the pill or female condoms either.\n\nHe's feeling conflicted: he wants to be responsible but doesn't want to be selfish by suddenly imposing his views. The question is whether he's wrong to consider reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the guy's main argument is about safety and responsibility. He's in a situation where an unintended pregnancy would be a big problem for both of them, especially given their age and living circumstances. On the other hand, the girlfriend is adamant about not using protection, possibly due to past habits and discomfort. She might see the pull-out method as sufficient, but he's pointing out that it's less reliable. \n\nNow, when considering if he's in the wrong, it's important to look at communication and compromise. He has already tried to discuss it, and she's not budging. If he stops or reduces sex to push her towards a safer method, is that fair? In relationships, both partners need to be on the same page regarding such critical issues. If she's unwilling to consider any protection, it's a risk he might not be comfortable taking. However, reducing sex could be seen as a form of coercion or using sex as leverage, which is not ideal. \n\nBut given that they are both young and not ready for parenthood, his concern is valid. The key is whether he's giving her a real choice or just trying to force his will. If he's setting a boundary for himself because he can't take the risk, that's understandable. However, if he's using the threat of reduced intimacy to pressure her into changing her stance, that might be problematic. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The author is trying to protect both himself and his partner from an unintended pregnancy, which is responsible. However, the method he's considering (reducing sex) could be seen as a way to manipulate her into using protection. That's where he might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's honestly trying to find a compromise and this is his way of communicating that, maybe not. But the question is about whether he's the asshole if he does this. \n\nAnother angle: mutual consent and compromise. If she's not willing to use any form of protection, maybe he needs to consider alternative solutions. But if he's not willing to engage in unprotected sex due to the risks, then he's justified in not having sex. However, it's important that he's not forcing her to use protection but rather setting his own boundaries. \n\nIn summary, the guy is trying to be responsible but the way he's approaching it might be an issue. If he stops sex without giving her a real opportunity to reconsider or without finding a middle ground, it could be seen as selfish. But if he's trying to find a solution and this is part of that process, maybe not. The answer depends on intent and communication. Since he's already tried discussing and she's not open, he might be at a point where he can't compromise further without risking his own well-being. So, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
