I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. The situation is that they've been together over a year, both 20, and he's concerned about pregnancy. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms, relying on pull-out and her past experience. He's conflicted between his responsibility and not wanting to interfere with their sex life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is trying to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. He's communicated his stance before, and there were arguments. Now he's thinking of reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, he has a right to express his boundaries and health concerns. Condoms are a standard form of protection, and not using them increases risks. His stance seems responsible. But on the other hand, by reducing sex unilaterally, is he being selfish or not respecting her autonomy? The girlfriend has her own preferences and reasons, even if they might be considered less safe. They haven't found a mutual agreement yet.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author has tried discussing it before, but they haven't resolved the issue. If he's considering reducing sex as a consequence, is that a reasonable step? It could be seen as a way to enforce his boundaries, but it might also be seen as a manipulation tactic. However, in consensual relationships, both partners need to agree on terms that work for them. If she's not willing to compromise, and he's not comfortable with the risk, then adjusting the frequency of sex could be a way to prioritize his own health and prevent potential issues.\n\nBut is it wrong? If they're both consenting adults and the girlfriend is aware of the risks and still chooses not to use protection, then he's not obligated to continue without his comfort. However, reducing sex without discussing it might hurt her feelings or create tension. The ethical stance here might depend on whether he's approaching this as a collaborative problem-solving effort rather than an ultimatum.\n\nIn some perspectives, setting boundaries is not wrong. However, doing so without mutual agreement could be problematic. The author might need to have a more open conversation about their differing needs and see if there's another solution they can both agree on. If he proceeds to reduce sex without addressing it, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if he's trying to find a middle ground, maybe he's in the right.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is acting unilaterally without discussion. Since he's thinking about reducing sex until a middle ground is found, it's part of his effort to manage his boundaries. Given that both are adults and the girlfriend is aware of the risks, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to protect himself. So the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
