I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection except the pull-out method. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms or other forms of birth control, and the author is conflicted between their responsibility and not wanting to be selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both are 20 and living with their parents, so they might not be financially or emotionally ready for children. The author has tried to push for condoms before but the girlfriend resisted. Now the author is thinking about reducing sex to find a middle ground. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they do that.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if others agree. Let me break it down. The key issues here are consent, responsibility, and communication in a relationship. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and has valid reasons given their age and living situation. The girlfriend is in a past relationship where she didn't use condoms and hasn't gotten pregnant, but the pull-out method isn't reliable. The author feels she's being irrational, which is a common point of conflict in relationships when it comes to health and safety.\n\nIf the author wants to stop or reduce sex to avoid a situation they're not prepared for, is that justified? In a consensual relationship, both partners should agree on the terms of their sexual activity. If the girlfriend is unwilling to use any protection, and the author is uncomfortable with the risk, then the author has the right to set boundaries. However, the way they approach it matters. Abruptly stopping without discussion could be seen as a power move or not respecting the relationship's current dynamics. But the author mentions trying to find a middle ground, which suggests they're open to compromise, not just imposing their will.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she doesn't like condoms and has gotten lucky before. The author points out that luck isn't a strategy, and the pull-out method isn't foolproof. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and the relationship's future stability. If the author communicates clearly and respectfully, explaining their reasons and being open to other contraceptive methods the girlfriend might be willing to try, then it's not necessarily wrong. But if they just stop without discussion, that could be problematic.\n\nHowever, the author is considering reducing sex until a middle ground is found. That seems like a way to buy time and encourage dialogue without being abrupt. The question is whether this is a valid step. From a rights perspective, each person can set their own limits on sexual activity. If the author is okay with not having sex to avoid the risk, they aren't wrong. The girlfriend's choice not to use protection is her decision, but the author's right to avoid the risk is also a factor.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves. But maybe they should try to find a solution that works for both. The answer here is likely that they are not in the wrong, but it's important to handle the situation with care and open communication. The initial answer the user gave was A (yes, in the wrong), but based on this reasoning, B (not in the wrong) makes more sense because the author is prioritizing their own safety and the relationship's stability. They're not forcing the issue but are trying to set boundaries to find a compromise.\n"
