I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Acting) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to not using condoms.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents. The guy wants to use condoms because they can't handle a child right now. The girlfriend refuses, uses pull-out method, says she's had unprotected sex before without getting pregnant, doesn't like how condoms feel. They've argued before, and now the guy is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe guy is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and wants protection. His partner is not using any method except pull-out, which he's already tried to insist on condoms. Now he's considering reducing sex until they find a compromise. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. They've discussed this multiple times, but she's not willing to use condoms, birth control, or female condoms. The guy is worried about the risk, and he's not in a position to have children. \n\nIs it fair for him to reduce or stop sex? Well, consent and mutual agreement are important. If they can't agree on a method, then maybe one partner is unhappy with the risk. The guy is trying to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy. But is reducing sex an acceptable action here? \n\nHe's not forcing her to use something; he's trying to find a solution. If she's not willing to compromise, maybe his right to set boundaries is valid. However, reducing sex could be seen as a form of pressure, but if it's to protect against a risk he's not comfortable with, it might be justified. \n\nAlso, the fact that they're both young and not in a position for parenthood is a factor. The guy is acting in both their best interests by wanting to avoid pregnancy. The girlfriend's argument is that she's had unprotected sex before without issues, but that's not a guarantee. Risk is inherent there. \n\nThe guy is not being coercive; he's trying to communicate his needs. If she's not willing to meet him halfway, then his decision to reduce sex might be a way to maintain his own boundaries. In that case, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
