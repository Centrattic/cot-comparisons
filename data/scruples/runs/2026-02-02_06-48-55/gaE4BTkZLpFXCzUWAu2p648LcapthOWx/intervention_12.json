I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend are in a relationship, and they've been having sex without protection except the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms because they're both young, not ready for kids, and they feel it's irresponsible. The girlfriend doesn't want to use them, says she never did in the past and that it's not a big deal. They've had arguments about it.\n\nNow, the author is considering reducing or stopping their sex until they can find a middle ground. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what others think. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's position is about responsibility, economic and emotional readiness, and safety. The girlfriend's stance is that she's been fine without condoms before, prefers the way it feels, and doesn't want to use other methods like the pill or female condoms. \n\nThe key issue here is mutual consent and compromise. The author is trying to protect both of them by using protection, which is a responsible approach. However, the girlfriend is not willing to compromise on this, which creates a conflict. The author is considering reducing sex as a way to avoid an unwanted pregnancy or to push for a compromise. \n\nIs it the author's fault for wanting to set a boundary to protect their future? They're trying to be responsible. The girlfriend is being dismissive of the risks, which could lead to a potential pregnancy. The author is facing a dilemma between their partner's wishes and their own values.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The author is not forcing the girlfriend to use condoms, but is expressing their need for protection. If she refuses, the author's choice to reduce or stop sex could be seen as a way to stay true to their principles, not as selfishness. However, it's important that they communicate openly and try to find a solution both can agree on. \n\nSince the girlfriend is not willing to consider other forms of birth control and the author is trying to protect their future, the author might not be in the wrong here. The key is mutual respect and consent. If the author is willing to discuss and find a middle ground, like maybe trying female condoms again or exploring other options, but the girlfriend is not, then the author's decision to reduce sex could be a valid choice to avoid compromising their own safety and future.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
