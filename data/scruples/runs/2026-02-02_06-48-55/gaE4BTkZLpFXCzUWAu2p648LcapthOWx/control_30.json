I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because she refuses to use protection. \n\nFirst, the context: They're both 20, in a year-long relationship, having unprotected sex with the pull-out method. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and the lack of protection, especially since they can't afford kids right now. The girlfriend argues she's been fine in the past, doesn't like condoms, and that the pull-out is enough. She's also against other methods like the pill or female condoms.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He feels it's unsafe but doesn't want to be selfish by imposing his will. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nLooking at consent and mutual agreement. In a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on sexual safety. The girlfriend isn't meeting the author's needs for protection, which is a valid concern. The author is trying to communicate his boundaries, which is his right. However, reducing sex because of a disagreement might be a form of using sex as leverage, which isn't healthy. But given the potential risks (pregnancy), he's trying to protect both of them.\n\nIs he wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's prioritizing safety and communication. On the other, using sex as a way to pressure her into compliance could be seen as manipulative. But if they can't agree on protection, reducing sex to avoid an unwanted pregnancy seems reasonable. The key is whether it's a mutual decision or a power play. Since he's looking for a middle ground, it's more about finding a solution rather than punishment. So, likely not in the wrong.\n"
