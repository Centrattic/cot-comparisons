I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for considering stopping or reducing sex with his girlfriend because they don't use protection except the pull-out method. The author is 20, living with parents, not ready for children. His girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms or other birth control methods, saying she's never used them before and there's no point since he's pulling out anyway.\n\nHmm, first, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are his responsibility versus her autonomy. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and wants to use protection, which is a reasonable stance. He's not ready for parenthood and it's economically and emotionally unfeasible. His girlfriend, on the other hand, is resistant to using any protection because of how they feel and her past experience. She argues that the pull-out method is sufficient and that the risk of condom breakage is worse than the method they're using. \n\nThe author mentions feeling that she's being irrational, but he's also aware that it might be selfish to impose his views suddenly. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. Is this a valid action? Well, birth control is a shared responsibility. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method and the other isn't willing to compromise, it's a serious issue. The author is right to be concerned about potential pregnancy, which is a major life decision. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for trying to reduce sex to address this. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she doesn't want to use any protection. The author has tried discussing other methods like the pill or female condoms, but she's not open to them. So, the author is left with two options: either go along with her choice and take the risk, or enforce protection, which she resists. If he decides to reduce sex, is that wrong? It depends on the context. If communication has broken down and she's unwilling to consider alternatives, then the author has a right to prioritize his own boundaries. However, he should try to communicate his needs clearly and maybe seek couples' counseling if possible. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's trying to protect himself from an unintended pregnancy, which is a significant risk, then it's not wrong for him to set that boundary. However, if he had agreed to the pull-out method before and is now changing the terms without mutual agreement, that might be seen as a betrayal of trust. The initial argument suggests that they had a disagreement but continued without protection, so maybe the author is now backing out. But the pull-out method is not reliable. The author is trying to do what's responsible, but his girlfriend isn't budging. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to have mutual agreement on such matters. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method and the other isn't willing to adjust, then the first partner has a right to limit sexual activity to avoid compromising their own values or readiness. The author isn't trying to pressure her into using condoms; he's just considering reducing sex until they can find a solution. That's not necessarily wrong. However, he should make sure that this isn't a manipulative tactic but a genuine attempt to find a compromise. \n\nI think the author is in the right because he's advocating for a responsible approach and is willing to adjust the sexual frequency to address the issue. It's a matter of personal boundaries and shared responsibility. The girlfriend's refusal to use any protection despite the risks could be seen as being in the wrong, but the author's actions to reduce sex are a way to protect himself without being coercive. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
