I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. The girlfriend is against using condoms, preferring the pull-out method. The author is conflicted between wanting to prevent pregnancy and feeling it's selfish to impose his will.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The boyfriend is concerned about unintended pregnancy and the risks involved. He's mentioned using the pull-out method, which isn't very reliable. The girlfriend has her own reasons\u2014past experiences, preference for feeling, and maybe distrust in condoms. She's been in a previous relationship without condoms and hasn't gotten pregnant, so she might feel confident in the pull-out method. But the boyfriend isn't convinced and feels she's being irrational.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The author is trying to protect both of them from a situation they're not ready for. If they don't use protection, there's a risk of pregnancy, which could have serious consequences for both. The girlfriend isn't open to other forms of contraception like the pill or female condoms, so the boyfriend is left with a dilemma: either continue the current practice and take the risk, or reduce intimacy to push for change.\n\nIs it selfish to reduce sex to get a different outcome? Or is it responsible because he's prioritizing their future? The boyfriend isn't trying to control her, but rather to find a compromise. The girlfriend's stance is that the pull-out is enough, but statistically, it's not as effective as condoms. The boyfriend is trying to be proactive. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect both of them. His approach might be harsh, but the intent is valid. The answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
