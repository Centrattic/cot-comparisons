I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. The key points here are about consent, mutual agreement, and shared responsibility in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author and their girlfriend are both young, 20 years old, and living with their parents. They've been together over a year and have been using the pull-out method without condoms. The author has tried to insist on condoms before but had arguments. The girlfriend is resistant, saying she's never used condoms in past relationships, doesn't like how they feel, and believes the pull-out is enough because she's been lucky before. The author feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop or reduce sex if they can't agree on protection. Let's think about the responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners should be on the same page regarding sexual health and safety. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and has valid reasons\u2014economic and emotional readiness. The girlfriend isn't willing to use any protection, which the author sees as risky. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners need to compromise. If the author is uncomfortable with the current method and the girlfriend isn't budging, then the author's decision to reduce sexual activity until they can find a solution isn't necessarily wrong. It's about respecting each other's boundaries and health concerns. However, it's also important to communicate effectively and explore other options like birth control, which the girlfriend is against. \n\nThe author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing their own boundaries and health. The girlfriend's resistance might stem from personal preferences, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to set a boundary. The author's approach to seeking a middle ground is reasonable. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're taking responsibility for their comfort and safety, which is valid.\n"
