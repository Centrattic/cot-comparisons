I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he and his girlfriend have been together for over a year and they don't use any protection except the pull-out method. He's raised the issue of using condoms before because they're young and not ready for kids, but she didn't agree. They had an argument but continued without protection. Now he's reconsidered and wants to either stop or reduce sex until they find a middle ground. He's worried about imposing constraints but feels it's the responsible choice.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy without proper protection. The girlfriend has a history of not using condoms and refuses other methods, relying on the withdrawal method. The author feels that her reasoning is irrational because while she might have been lucky before, there's a real chance of pregnancy without protection, even with pull-out. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author is in a relationship where both partners need to agree on sexual health and contraception. If she's uncomfortable with condoms and other methods, maybe there's another way. However, the author is considering reducing or stopping sex, which could be a form of birth control. But is that fair? Let me think. If one partner doesn't want to use protection, but the other does, the responsible choice is to find a method both can agree on. The author is trying to make her see the risk by suggesting they reduce sex until they find a middle ground. \n\nBut wait, using abstinence as a method of birth control is the withdrawal method itself. If they only have sex when he pulls out, that's part of their current approach. However, the author is now considering using abstinence as a way to enforce this, which might be a bit of a power play. If he stops or reduces sex, is that imposing his will on her? Because if they don't have sex, it's not just her choice anymore. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not in a position to have a child and wants to avoid that. It's his right to set boundaries for his own well-being. The problem is that their current method doesn't align with his values. But is it okay to use abstinence as a way to pressure her into changing her stance? That might not be a healthy approach. Instead of reducing sex, they might need to find a compromise, like maybe using a different method she's more open to, even if she's not fond of condoms. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that she's never used condoms in the past and hasn't gotten pregnant. But that's a statistical anomaly; it doesn't mean it's safe. The author is right that relying on luck isn't a good strategy. However, if he unilaterally reduces or stops sex, that could be seen as coercing her into compliance. A better approach might be to have an open discussion, explore other contraceptive options she might be willing to try (like birth control pills, which she also refuses), or consider that maybe their relationship isn't aligned in this important aspect. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he stops sex to protect himself from pregnancy, which is a valid concern, but does that make him in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's prioritizing his own well-being and future. On the other, he might be using abstinence to pressure her into changing her mind, which could be manipulative. The key here is whether the decision is made collaboratively or unilaterally. If he's doing it without considering her feelings or finding a mutual agreement, then maybe he's overstepping. But since they've had arguments and she's not willing to compromise, perhaps he's just trying to set his own boundaries. \n\nWait, the question is whether he's in the wrong if he tries to reduce sex until they find middle ground. The answer depends on the context of their communication and mutual respect. If they can't agree on a method, then his actions might be a way to express his boundaries. But if that's a way to punish her or exert control, that's different. The author seems to be trying to avoid a situation he's not ready for, so maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the ethical aspect is about respecting her autonomy versus his own. Using abstinence as a strategy might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's trying to protect himself from a situation he's unprepared for, and if communication hasn't worked, setting a boundary by reducing or stopping sex is a personal choice. However, it's important that this is done without coercion and with open dialogue. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and given that he's making a decision based on his own readiness and the lack of mutual agreement, it's a valid choice. The girlfriend's refusal to use any form of protection beyond pull-out is the main issue here. So the author is trying to find a way to align their actions with his values.\n"
