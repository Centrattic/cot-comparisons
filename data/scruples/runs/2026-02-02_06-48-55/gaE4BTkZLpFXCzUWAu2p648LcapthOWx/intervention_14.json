I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, and they've been having sex without protection except for the pull-out method. He's tried to convince her to use condoms because they're young, living with their parents, and not ready for kids. She's resistant, saying she's never used condoms before and doesn't like how they feel. They've had arguments about this, and he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I should consider consent and communication. Both partners should agree on the terms of their sexual activity. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and wants to use protection. His girlfriend, however, is against it because of personal preferences and past experiences. Using the pull-out method is less effective than condoms, so he's worried they're taking a risk.\n\nNow, is it wrong for the author to want to reduce or stop sex if they can't agree on protection? Well, if they can't find a compromise, maybe reducing sex is a way to avoid potential problems. However, he should have discussed this clearly with her. If he unilaterally decides to reduce sex without her consent, that might be seen as controlling. But if they're in a situation where neither method is acceptable to both, maybe it's reasonable to take a break until they can agree.\n\nAlso, birth control options were mentioned. The girlfriend is against pills and female condoms. Maybe exploring other methods together could help. If they can't find a solution, maybe taking a break is better than continuing without protection. The author is trying to protect himself economically and emotionally, which is understandable. But the girlfriend's feelings and preferences are also important. It's a balance between safety and mutual satisfaction.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have a role. The author is advocating for protection, which is responsible. His girlfriend is asserting her preferences. If they can't agree, maybe taking a break is a way to respect both sides. However, the author should ensure that his actions aren't being coercive. It's about finding a middle ground, not imposing his will. If he stops sex without her consent, it could be seen as inconsiderate. But if they're both open to discussing and finding a solution, then maybe it's a necessary step.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he communicates openly and they both agree to reduce sex until they find a solution, then it's not wrong. But if he does it unilaterally without her input, that's more problematic. The question is whether he's imposing it \"out of nowhere,\" as he mentioned. He's been trying to discuss it, so maybe he's justified. The key is mutual agreement. If he reduces sex without her consent, he might be wrong. If they're working together, then not. The answer might depend on the dynamics of their communication.\n"
