I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend over the use of protection. They've been using the pull-out method, and the author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy. They've tried discussing condoms, but the girlfriend is resistant, citing past relationships and preference against condoms. The author feels conflicted between imposing their preference and not wanting to be selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect in relationships. Both partners should have a say in their sexual health decisions. The author is voicing their concerns about not using protection, which is understandable given their age and financial situation. However, the girlfriend is clearly against using condoms and other methods. \n\nIn a consensual relationship, both partners need to agree on boundaries. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current situation but the other isn't willing to compromise, it's challenging. The author is considering reducing or stopping sex to find a middle ground. This could be seen as respecting their own boundaries and prioritizing their well-being. However, it's important that this decision is made through open communication, not as a punishment.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument that she's not willing to use any form of protection, including female condoms or birth control, might be a deal-breaker for the author. If the author feels that their needs for protection are not being met and they can't find a compromise, it's reasonable for them to reassess the situation. But the key is that this should be a mutual decision, not a unilateral one without discussion. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author decides to reduce sex to protect themselves from a potential unwanted pregnancy, that's within their right. They are not forcing their partner to do anything, just setting boundaries based on their own comfort. The girlfriend's refusal to use protection is her choice, but the author has the right to prioritize their own safety. \n\nBut there's a possibility that the author might be using this as a way to exert control or avoid responsibility if the girlfriend does get pregnant. It's important that the author approaches this with empathy and continues to communicate. However, given that the author is trying to negotiate and hasn't already imposed a complete stop, it seems like they're being responsible. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because they are advocating for their own needs and safety in the relationship. The girlfriend's stance is her choice, but the author has the right to seek a compromise that aligns with their values and circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
