I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for potentially reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. They've been together over a year, both are 20, and they use the pull-out method. The author wants protection, but the girlfriend refuses, citing past relationships and personal preference. He feels she's being irrational.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in relationships. Both partners should agree on sexual health measures. The author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy and wants to use condoms. His girlfriend is against them, which creates a conflict. The author is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground. \n\nIs he wrong to do that? Well, if they can't agree on protection, one partner might need to adjust to the other's boundaries. The author isn't forcing her to use protection, but he's uncomfortable with the current situation. He's not pressuring her; he's trying to find a compromise. However, reducing sex could be seen as a form of pressure, maybe even withdrawal of affection to change her behavior. That could be manipulative.\n\nBut also, he's prioritizing his own comfort and safety. If he's not willing to have unprotected sex, then reducing or stopping until they find a solution makes sense. However, communication is key. They need to discuss their values and boundaries. If she's unwilling to consider any form of protection except the pull-out method, maybe he's justified in seeking a compromise. \n\nOn the other hand, if he's using the reduction in sex as a tactic to force her to comply, that's not healthy. But the author says he's trying to find a middle ground, not impose his will. He's considering alternatives like female condoms or birth control, which she's against. So he's open to discussion but she's not budging. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If she refuses all forms of protection, and he's unwilling to accept that risk, then he's within his rights to adjust his behavior. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But I have to be careful not to assume. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's trying to protect himself and his partner by reducing sex until they can agree, that's responsible. However, using sex as a leverage could be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether his approach is manipulative or self-protective.\n"
