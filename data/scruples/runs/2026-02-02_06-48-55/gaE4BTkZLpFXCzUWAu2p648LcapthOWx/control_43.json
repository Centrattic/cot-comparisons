I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if it would be wrong for the author to reduce or stop having sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The couple has been together for over a year. They're both 20, living with their parents, and the author is concerned about the economic and emotional readiness for children. They've tried using condoms before, but the girlfriend didn't like them and prefers the pull-out method, which isn't reliable. The author feels she's being irrational, but they've had arguments about it.\n\nThe author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual agreement in a relationship. Using protection is a shared responsibility, and both partners should agree on it. The girlfriend's stance is that she's been fine without condoms before and doesn't want to use them. The author feels it's unsafe and wants to protect against unintended pregnancy.\n\nNow, in a relationship, both partners have the right to their boundaries. The author is trying to express his concerns and set a boundary for his comfort and safety. However, if he unilaterally reduces or stops sex without mutual agreement, it could be seen as imposing his will, which might not be healthy. But the alternative is that the girlfriend isn't respecting his concerns about protection, which could lead to harm if she becomes pregnant.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for trying to reduce sex. If he's not forcing her but is setting a boundary for his own well-being, maybe he's justified. But if he's doing it without discussing and reaching an agreement, that might be problematic. However, the scenario says he's trying to find a middle ground, so perhaps he's still open to negotiation. \n\nThe user mentions that the author feels it's selfish to impose, but also that it's the smart thing. There's a balance between personal responsibility and respecting a partner's choices. The girlfriend's refusal to use any form of protection (including female condoms or birth control) increases the risk, which the author is concerned about. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about whether the author is respecting her autonomy versus his own safety. If they can't find a compromise, it's possible that the author is within his rights to set boundaries. However, relationships require mutual consent, so if the author reduces sex without agreement, it might be seen as his way of enforcing his will. But considering the potential consequences of not using protection, his concern is valid. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's trying to protect against a significant risk and is seeking a solution, which is responsible. But I need to check if there's any aspect where he's violating her autonomy. If he's not pressuring her but setting a boundary due to his own limits, it's his right. However, if it's an ultimatum without discussion, maybe. But the scenario says he's trying to find a middle ground, so it's not an ultimatum yet. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
