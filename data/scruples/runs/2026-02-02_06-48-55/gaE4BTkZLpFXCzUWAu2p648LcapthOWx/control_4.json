I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. The situation is that they're both 20, not in a place to have kids, and have been using the pull-out method. The author tried to use condoms before, but she didn't like them. Now he's worried about the risks and wants to find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects here. The main issue is consent and mutual agreement in their relationship. The girlfriend is against using any protection except the pull-out method, and she's been consistent in her past relationships. The author feels she's being irrational, but he's also conflicted about imposing his will on their sex life.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have a say in matters that affect them both. The author is trying to protect himself from an unwanted pregnancy, which is a valid concern. However, reducing or stopping sex because of a disagreement might be seen as a form of coercion if not handled with mutual understanding. The key here is communication. Have they tried to find a compromise that works for both? The author suggests birth control, but she's against that too.\n\nIt's important to consider that the girlfriend's past choices don't necessarily predict the future. Relying on the pull-out method has a higher failure rate compared to condoms or birth control. The author's concern is about responsibility, which is reasonable. But is he in the wrong for wanting to stop sex to avoid a risky situation?\n\nLegally and ethically, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. Since they haven't reached a mutual agreement, the author's decision to reduce sex might be seen as a way to protect himself. However, doing so without resolving the underlying conflict could hurt the relationship. The answer depends on whether the author communicates his reasons clearly and if both are open to finding a solution. If the author is acting in good faith and tries to discuss it without being coercive, he's not necessarily in the wrong. But if he's using the reduction in sex as a tactic to force her to comply, that's different. The scenario suggests he's trying to find a middle ground, so it's more about protecting mutual interests. Therefore, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
