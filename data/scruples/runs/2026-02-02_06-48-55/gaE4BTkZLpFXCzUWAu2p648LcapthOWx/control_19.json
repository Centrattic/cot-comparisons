I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the key points from their message.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for over a year and they're both 20, living with their parents. They've been having unprotected sex except for the pull-out method. The author has wanted to use condoms before because they don't feel ready for kids financially or emotionally, but the girlfriend didn't agree, leading to arguments. The girlfriend's reasons are that she's never used condoms in past relationships, never got pregnant, and doesn't like how they feel. The author argues that condoms are a safer compromise, but she's resistant. They've also tried discussing other methods like birth control pills or female condoms, which she's against too. Now the author is considering reducing or stopping sex until they find a middle ground and is asking if they'd be in the wrong (WIBTA).\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially reducing or stopping sex. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author has valid concerns about unintended pregnancy and is trying to protect both of them. They've communicated their needs and tried to find a compromise, but the girlfriend is unwilling to use any form of protection beyond the pull-out method. The author feels it's irresponsible and wants to take steps to avoid a situation they're not ready for. On the other hand, the girlfriend has her own preferences and has been consistent in her stance. The author is now considering limiting sex, which could be seen as a form of coercion or using intimacy as leverage in the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author seems to have tried discussing it, but there's a lack of agreement. If they can't reach a consensus, maybe the author is right to prioritize their own values and boundaries. However, reducing sex could be seen as a power play if not done with mutual understanding. The author might be justified in protecting their own interests, especially since they're not in a position to have children. But they also need to consider their partner's feelings and whether this decision is fair.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend isn't taking responsibility for contraception, which the author finds irrational. The author's stance is about safety and responsibility. If they can't agree, then the author might be in the right to adjust their behavior to align with their own values, even if it means less intimacy. However, the approach of reducing sex without a mutual agreement might be seen as abrupt. Maybe the author should find another way to address it without withdrawing intimacy, but since they've tried other methods and it's not working, this could be a last resort.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't forcing the girlfriend to use protection; they're choosing to take action to prevent a situation they're unprepared for. They're also considering their partner's comfort (suggesting female condoms, etc.), but she's unwilling. So, the author is in a tough spot. They're not in the wrong for prioritizing their own boundaries and safety. The girlfriend is also not in the wrong for having her preferences, but they can't both get exactly what they want. The author's decision to reduce sex is a personal choice based on their own values and concerns, so they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, the way they approach it matters. If it's done respectfully and with communication, it's more about setting boundaries than being in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
