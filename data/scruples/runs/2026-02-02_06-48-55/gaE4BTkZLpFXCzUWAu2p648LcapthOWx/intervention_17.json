I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who's been together for over a year, and they haven't been using protection except for the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms, but his girlfriend doesn't. They've had arguments about it. Now he's considering reducing their sex until they find a middle ground, and he's asking if that would make him a bad person (WIBTA).\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author is 20, living with his parents, and not economically or emotionally ready for children. He's concerned about the risks of not using protection. His girlfriend, also 20, has used the pull-out method in the past without getting pregnant. She doesn't like condoms, thinks they don't feel as good, and argues that using a condom doesn't make sense if he's still going to pull out, so there's no point. She's resistant to other methods like the pill or female condoms.\n\nThe author feels conflicted: he wants to protect both of them from an unplanned pregnancy, but he also doesn't want to impose his will on their relationship. He's considering reducing sex until they can agree on a middle ground.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The main issue here is about consent and mutual agreement in a relationship. Both partners should have a say in their sexual health decisions. The author is trying to set a boundary for his own comfort and safety, which is understandable. But the girlfriend is equally resistant, possibly because she's not comfortable with condoms and feels her past experiences (not getting pregnant with pull-out) give her confidence.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners agree on contraceptive methods. If one partner is not willing to use any method, the other has the right to set boundaries. However, reducing or stopping sex might be seen as a drastic step. But if the author is uncomfortable with the current arrangement and the risk, he's within his rights to seek a solution that makes him feel safe. The key is communication and finding a compromise. Since they've tried discussing it multiple times without success, maybe his decision to reduce sex until a middle ground is found isn't wrong. He's taking responsibility for his own safety and is trying to avoid an unwanted situation. However, there's also a consideration of respecting her preferences and ensuring that the decision isn't one-sided. But given the potential consequences (unplanned pregnancy), prioritizing safety is a valid stance. So, I think he's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
