I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not using protection except the pull-out method, and the author wants to stop or reduce sex until they find a middle ground. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and the lack of protection. They've tried discussing it before, and the girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms or other methods. The author now considers reducing sex until they can agree. The girlfriend argues that she's never used condoms before and hasn't gotten pregnant, and she doesn't like how they feel. She's resistant to other methods too.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong to take this step. In relationships, communication and mutual consent are key. The author is trying to address a safety concern, which is valid. However, reducing or stopping sex without mutual agreement could be seen as a form of withholding intimacy, which might be considered selfish or manipulative. But it's also about protecting against unintended pregnancy, which is a significant issue.\n\nThe author has tried discussing it and compromising (suggesting condoms with pull-out as a compromise, which the girlfriend rejects). They might feel that their concerns are not being respected, leading to a stalemate. The girlfriend's stance is that she's being responsible based on her past, but the author sees it as risky.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author isn't trying to harm the relationship but is prioritizing their own safety and financial/emotional readiness. However, withholding sex could be seen as a power move, especially if the girlfriend doesn't feel heard or if there's a lack of mutual respect in the decision-making process.\n\nI need to weigh the author's right to set boundaries against the potential impact on the relationship. If the author communicates their concerns clearly and seeks a solution, they might not be in the wrong. But if they're using sex as leverage without a clear plan to resolve the issue, it could be problematic. Since the author is willing to find a middle ground, their intention might be to encourage discussion rather than to punish. However, the effectiveness of this approach is questionable, and it could lead to more conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If they're acting out of genuine concern and trying to protect against a serious risk, they might not be wrong. But if they're using this as a way to force the girlfriend into compliance without addressing her feelings, they could be. The key is mutual communication and respect. Since the author is seeking a middle ground and has tried discussing it before, their actions might be justified. However, reducing sex without a mutual agreement could still be seen as wrong because it affects both partners' needs and desires. So, maybe the answer is A or B based on that balance.\n"
