I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether to stop or reduce sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. They've been together over a year, both 20, living with parents, and don't want kids right now. The girl doesn't use condoms because she doesn't like the feeling and her past relationships didn't use them either. The author has tried to push for condoms, but she resists. Now he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The author wants to avoid pregnancy and is concerned about their economic and emotional readiness. The girlfriend, while smart, is being inconsistent with protection. The pull-out method isn't reliable, and the author is right that she might be lucky but it's still risky. \n\nThe author is trying to prioritize their mutual safety, which is understandable. But he's also considering whether it's selfish to impose his wishes. However, since both are in a committed relationship and want to avoid pregnancy, it's a shared responsibility. The girlfriend isn't open to other methods like the pill or female condoms, so the author's attempts to introduce protection are valid.\n\nReducing sex might be a way to encourage her to take the issue seriously. However, it's important to communicate and find a solution together. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect both of them. The question is whether he's being reasonable in his approach. Since he's tried discussing it multiple times and she's not budging, taking a step back to protect their goals (no kids, financial stability) isn't selfish. So the answer might be B (No) because he's acting in their shared best interest.\n"
