I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to their disagreement on using protection.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20, not ready for kids. The author wants to use condoms, the girlfriend doesn't, using the pull-out method instead. She's resistant because of past experiences (no pregnancy without condoms) and dislikes condom feel. They've had arguments about it. The author feels she's being irrational, but now he's thinking about reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's concerned about unintended pregnancy and financial/emotional readiness. He's tried discussing alternatives like female condoms or birth control, but she's not interested. He feels it's irresponsible to not use protection and is conflicted between respecting her feelings and protecting himself. Wanting to reduce sex to avoid coercion or pressure seems like he's trying to find a solution without forcing her, which could be seen as responsible.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She values their current sexual experience without condoms, feels the pull-out method is sufficient, and has a history of not getting pregnant without them. She might see the author's push for condoms as unnecessary and intrusive, especially if he's not compromising on her preferences.\n\nEthically, consent and mutual agreement are key. The author isn't forcing her to use protection, but he's considering reducing intimacy as a way to manage the risk. However, withholding sex could be seen as a form of control or punishment, especially if it's a way to pressure her into using condoms. On the other hand, it's his right to set boundaries for his own comfort and safety.\n\nLegally, there's no right or wrong here, but morally, it's about mutual respect. If the author communicates his reasons clearly and they can't find a compromise, reducing intimacy to avoid risk might be his prerogative. However, it's important to ensure it's not a manipulation tactic but a genuine effort to protect both.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel safe. The author's approach might be valid if they can't agree on protection methods. However, the key is communication and ensuring that neither feels coerced. Since they're both in a relationship, they need to find a solution that respects both parties' needs. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his safety, but he should consider if reducing sex is truly a respectful approach or if it might harm their relationship dynamics.\n"
