I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend have been together for over a year. They don't use any protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to insist on using condoms before because they're young, living with parents, and not ready for kids. The girlfriend doesn't want to, citing past relationships without condoms and never getting pregnant. She doesn't like how condoms feel. They've had arguments about this. The author is now considering reducing their sex life until they find a middle ground.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLet me consider both sides. The author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy and is trying to protect both of them. The girlfriend is resistant, maybe due to past habits or personal preference. The author is considering reducing sex, which could be seen as a form of withholding intimacy as a response to the disagreement. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties should be on the same page regarding contraception. The girlfriend's approach (pull-out and no condoms) is riskier, and the author is trying to mitigate that. However, the solution the author is considering\u2014reducing sex\u2014might be a form of coercion or emotional pressure, which could be problematic. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to communicate his concerns and has tried discussing alternatives like birth control or female condoms, which she's not interested in. If both are not willing to compromise, then perhaps it's a valid stance to take a break until they can agree. However, withholding sex as a response might be seen as a tactic to force her hand, which isn't healthy. But the user's question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, he's trying to protect both of them from an unwanted pregnancy. On the other, reducing sex without mutual agreement could be seen as a form of emotional manipulation. But if the alternative is having unprotected sex against his will, then maybe he's justified. The key here is whether communication has been sufficient. The author has tried multiple times, and she remains resistant. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend's argument that she's been okay before doesn't eliminate the risk. The author is right to point out that it's about probability. However, her refusal to consider any form of protection is a problem. The author's willingness to try other methods she's not accepting might not be enough. \n\nIf the author reduces the sex until they find a middle ground, is that wrong? If both are not willing to compromise, then maybe it's reasonable for him to prioritize his own comfort and the relationship's stability by not engaging in sex until they can agree. But if this leads to resentment or becomes a power play, it might not be healthy. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to reduce sex if you're not in agreement on contraception? It's a tough call. The author is trying to prevent a situation he's not ready for, so his intentions are to protect both. However, using the reduction of sex as a tool to pressure the other person might not be the healthiest approach. But since they haven't found mutual agreement, maybe it's a necessary step for him to take. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to communicate his needs and protect both of them, and if the other party is unwilling to budge, it's reasonable for him to take steps to align their actions with his own values and safety. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
