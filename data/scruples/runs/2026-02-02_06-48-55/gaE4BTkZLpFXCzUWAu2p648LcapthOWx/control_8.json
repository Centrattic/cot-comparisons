I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together over a year, both 20, living with parents, and they use the pull-out method without other protection. The author wants to use condoms for safety, but the girlfriend doesn't want to. They've had arguments about it. The girlfriend has been in past relationships without condoms and hasn't gotten pregnant, so she feels the pull-out is enough. The author is concerned about the risk and feels the girlfriend is being irrational. Now, the author is thinking about reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Let me think about the key points. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and doesn't want to be a parent yet. The girlfriend is resistant to using condoms or other birth control methods. The author feels it's irresponsible not to use protection. The author is considering reducing or stopping sex as a way to handle the situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit about consent and mutual agreement. Both partners should agree on sexual practices. The author is prioritizing their own boundaries and safety. The girlfriend isn't willing to compromise, but the author is trying to find a solution that works for both. The author isn't forcing the girlfriend to use protection but is considering reducing sex to avoid a situation they can't handle. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, both partners have the right to set boundaries. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method and wants a different approach, it's reasonable to adjust the sexual activity until an agreement is reached. The author isn't being coercive; they're trying to communicate their needs. The girlfriend's refusal to use protection is a risk that the author isn't willing to take, so taking steps to reduce sex to avoid that risk seems within their rights. \n\nHowever, one might argue that the author is imposing their will, but since the girlfriend is the one who's not using protection, the author is setting their own boundaries. The author isn't forcing the girlfriend to do anything; they're just choosing to limit their own actions to respect their own concerns. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision to reduce or stop sex is a way to protect themselves and find a middle ground, which is a valid approach in a consensual relationship. The key is mutual agreement, and if they can't agree, adjusting the level of intimacy is a reasonable step. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
