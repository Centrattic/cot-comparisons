I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they don't use protection except the pull-out method. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is concerned about the lack of protection, especially since they're young and can't handle a child financially or emotionally. He's tried to use condoms before, but she didn't like them and they've had arguments. She's been in another relationship without condoms and hasn't gotten pregnant, so she thinks the pull-out is enough. The author feels she's being irrational and is conflicted about whether to reduce sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angles. The author wants to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy. That's a valid concern. On the other hand, the girlfriend is asserting her autonomy in choosing birth control methods she's comfortable with. The author is considering reducing or stopping sex, which could be seen as a form of coercion if it's to force her into using protection she's against. But he's also trying to balance his own needs and values here.\n\nIs it selfish? The author argues it's for safety, but his girlfriend might see his actions as prioritizing his fears over her autonomy. The key here is mutual consent and compromise. If he reduces sex without her agreement, is that a violation? There's a point where personal boundaries are important, but pressuring someone to stop sex unless they comply with your conditions can be manipulative. However, he's also trying to find a middle ground, which is responsible. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether reducing sex is a legitimate step when there's a mutual but unresolved conflict. If he's not pressuring her to use protection but is instead managing his own boundaries, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's using withholding sex as a tactic to change her mind, that's more problematic. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to see if there's a middle ground where both are accountable. Since they haven't found a solution yet, maybe the author is justified in seeking a compromise, but the method of reducing sex might be where the issue is. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. So, considering all angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's acting to protect both of them, but it's a close call.\n"
