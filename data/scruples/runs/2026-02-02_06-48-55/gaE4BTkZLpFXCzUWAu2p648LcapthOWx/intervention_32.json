I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they don't use protection except the pull-out method. The girlfriend has a history of not using condoms in past relationships and feels they don't like how they feel. The boyfriend is concerned about the risk of unintended pregnancy and their financial/emotional readiness. The author is thinking about cutting back on sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical and relational aspects. The boyfriend has valid concerns about not being ready for children, which is responsible. The girlfriend's stance is based on personal preference and past experience, but she's dismissing the potential risk. The key here is mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries. The boyfriend feels the pull-out method isn't enough and is trying to communicate that. The girlfriend isn't willing to use any protection, which could be seen as not respecting his concerns. \n\nNow, the author's consideration to reduce sex until they agree on a middle ground. Is that fair? Well, if both are in agreement, then it's a solution. But if he unilaterally decides without discussion, that could be a problem. However, given that they've already had arguments and she's not compromising, he's trying to find a respectful way to address his boundaries. His right to set boundaries for his own comfort and safety is important. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user says they think he is, but I need to evaluate. If he's trying to protect himself from a situation that he's uncomfortable with and has communicated that, then prioritizing his own well-being isn't wrong. However, using the threat of reducing intimacy as leverage might be problematic. The ideal scenario is open communication and finding a solution both can agree on. \n\nThe girlfriend's refusal to use any protection despite the boyfriend's concerns might indicate she's not respecting his boundaries. The author is trying to address this by seeking a compromise. So, in this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's standing up for his needs while trying to be considerate. The answer would likely be B (No), because he's not wrong to set boundaries for his own comfort and safety, even if it means adjusting their sexual activity until they can agree.\n"
