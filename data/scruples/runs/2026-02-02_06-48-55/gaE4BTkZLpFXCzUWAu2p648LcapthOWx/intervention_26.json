I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to the lack of protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The couple has been together over a year and hasn't used protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to get them to use condoms before because they're young, living with their parents, and not ready for children. The girlfriend refuses, saying she never used condoms before, doesn't like how they feel, and believes she's been lucky. She also argues that condoms can break, and if he insists on using them, he shouldn't use the pull-out method, which he finds contradictory.\n\nThe author now feels conflicted. He thinks it's responsible to use protection but also feels like he's being selfish if he imposes his will on their sex life. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual agreement in a relationship. Both partners have the right to express their boundaries and concerns. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and has communicated his reasons. The girlfriend, however, has her own reasons for not using protection. \n\nThe question is whether the author is justified in reducing or stopping sex if they can't agree. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to negotiate terms. If the author feels that continuing unprotected sex without a compromise is risky, he has the right to set boundaries for his own comfort and safety. However, doing so without a discussion might be seen as abrupt. \n\nBut the author has tried multiple times to discuss this. If the girlfriend is unwilling to consider alternatives like birth control pills or female condoms, which could address both concerns (safety and comfort), then the author might feel justified in prioritizing his safety. That said, reducing sex could be a form of withholding intimacy as a form of pressure, which might not be the most constructive approach. The real issue is whether both have a right to their boundaries. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting to protect himself from an unintended pregnancy, especially if he's not ready. However, the method of reducing sex without a mutual agreement could be problematic. It's possible that the author is in the right because he's making his boundaries clear, but the way he's handling it might need adjustment. Alternatively, since both have valid concerns, neither is entirely wrong. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. Since he's expressing his boundaries and trying to find a middle ground, he's not in the wrong for seeking a compromise. The girlfriend's refusal to consider alternatives might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
