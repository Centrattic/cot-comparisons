I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. The context is that they're both 20, not ready for kids, and the girl refuses condoms and other methods. The author feels it's unsafe but doesn't want to be selfish by cutting sex.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is consent and mutual agreement on safe sex. The author wants protection, the girlfriend doesn't. They've had arguments about it. The author is thinking of reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The question is whether that makes the author wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concern is valid\u2014they don't want to risk pregnancy. The girlfriend's stance is that she's been fine before and doesn't like condoms. But she's not using any other methods either. The author is trying to compromise, suggesting condoms even if they don't feel as good. The girlfriend isn't budging.\n\nNow, is the author wrong for wanting to set boundaries? If both partners aren't on the same page regarding safety, one might argue the author isn't wrong for trying to protect themselves. However, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a form of pressure if not communicated well. But in this case, the author is considering it after discussions and not being able to reach an agreement. It's about mutual consent and safety. Since both are adults and the author is trying to find a solution, maybe they're not wrong. Alternatively, if the author unilaterally decides without considering the partner's feelings, that could be an issue. But the scenario says they're trying to find middle ground. So the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they're acting in their best interest to avoid risks they've discussed. The girlfriend's refusal is her choice, but the author isn't wrong for protecting themselves.\n"
