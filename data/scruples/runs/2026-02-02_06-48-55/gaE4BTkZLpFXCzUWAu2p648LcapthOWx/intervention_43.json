I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author and his girlfriend not using protection except the pull-out method, and he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. Both are 20, young, living with parents, not in a position for kids. The author has tried to use condoms before, but the girlfriend doesn't want them. She argues that she's never used them before and hasn't gotten pregnant, and she doesn't like how they feel. The author feels she's being irrational. Now he's thinking about reducing sex to force a compromise.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to check. So, what's the right approach here? Condoms are a standard form of protection. The girlfriend is refusing, and the author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy and their readiness.\n\nIs it the author's fault for wanting to use protection? Probably not. But is it right for him to reduce or stop sex to enforce his preference? That's the key question. In relationships, communication and mutual consent are crucial. If both partners can't agree on protection methods, the decision should be mutual. The author's plan to reduce sex might be seen as a form of coercion, which isn't healthy. Instead of withholding sex, maybe finding another way to communicate and reach an agreement would be better. However, the girlfriend isn't budging, so he's in a tough spot.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's making a decision to protect himself and his future, maybe he's justified. However, using sex as leverage can be problematic. Also, the girlfriend isn't willing to consider other forms of birth control like the pill or female condoms. Maybe the author should explore other options or seek counseling. But in this scenario, he's considering reducing sex. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have a role. The author wants protection, the girlfriend refuses. If he can't convince her, then maybe he's not in the wrong for trying to protect himself. However, reducing sex could be seen as a selfish move if it's to pressure her. But if he's just trying to create a situation where they have to discuss it more seriously, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer might be that he's not in the wrong because he's taking steps to avoid a situation he's not ready for. But the method he's using (reducing sex) might not be the healthiest approach. However, given the context, he's trying to find a middle ground. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
