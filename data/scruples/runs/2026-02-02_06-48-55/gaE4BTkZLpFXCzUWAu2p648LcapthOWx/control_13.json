I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple in a year-long relationship where they're not using protection except the pull-out method. The author (male) wants to use condoms, but the girlfriend (female) refuses, citing past relationships without issues, personal preference for feeling, and dismissing the need. The author is conflicted between not wanting to impose but also feeling it's responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and health aspects. The main issue is contraceptive use and mutual agreement. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and is trying to protect both of them. The girlfriend is resistant, which can lead to conflict. The key points here are consent, communication, and shared responsibility.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. The author is trying to communicate his concerns, which is responsible. However, forcing a method without mutual agreement could be seen as controlling. But since he's discussing it and trying to find a middle ground, that's good. The girlfriend's refusal to consider any method (condoms, pills, female condoms) might indicate she's not compromising. The question is whether the author is wrong to reduce sex until they reach an agreement.\n\nThe author isn't being abusive; he's seeking a solution. It's important to respect each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend is unwilling to use any protection, the author's choice to reduce intimacy until they can agree isn't inherently wrong. However, he should ensure it's not a manipulative tactic. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's prioritizing health and communication.\n"
