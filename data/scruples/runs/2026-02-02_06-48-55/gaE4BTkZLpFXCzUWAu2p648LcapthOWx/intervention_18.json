I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce having sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection except the pull-out method, and she's resistant to using condoms or other birth control. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple has been together for over a year, both are 20 and living with their parents. The author wants to use protection for safety, but the girlfriend doesn't, citing past experiences and preference for the pull-out method. She doesn't like how condoms feel and says the pull-out method is enough. The author feels she's being irrational but is caught between wanting to be responsible and not wanting to be selfish.\n\nSo, the main issue is about the use of contraception. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and the risks involved, given their age and financial situation. The girlfriend, however, is not in favor of using any protection except the pull-out method, which they argue is less effective. The author is considering reducing or stopping sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a health and safety perspective, using protection is a responsible choice. The pull-out method isn't the most reliable, and the girlfriend's past luck doesn't account for future risks. The author has valid concerns about their readiness for parenthood. However, communication is key in relationships. The author has tried discussing this before, leading to arguments, and is now considering a drastic step (reducing sex) without finding a mutual agreement first.\n\nIt's important to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual relationships. If one partner is uncomfortable or refuses to use protection, the other partner has the right to set boundaries for their own well-being. But is it wrong to stop or reduce sex because of this? It might not be inherently wrong, but the approach matters. The author should focus on open, respectful communication and explore all options together rather than unilaterally changing the dynamic without resolution. If the author takes this step without trying to understand the girlfriend's perspective or without finding a compromise, it could be seen as selfish or dismissive of her feelings. However, if the author is prioritizing their own needs and the relationship's future, it's a necessary boundary. The answer hinges on whether the author has exhausted all communication avenues or is using a power dynamic to enforce their will. Since the author hasn't found a middle ground yet and is considering cutting back on sex, perhaps they need to revisit the conversation carefully, ensuring both parties are heard. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because reducing sex without addressing the issue collaboratively might be seen as an ultimatum rather than a solution. But if they're doing it to protect both of them and have tried everything else, maybe B. Hmm, tricky.\n"
