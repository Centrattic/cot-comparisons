I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they'd be in the wrong (WIBTA) if they reduced or stopped having sex with their girlfriend because she's not using protection. They've tried discussing it before, but she doesn't want to use condoms or other methods. He feels it's irresponsible but doesn't want to be selfish by cutting down on sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their situation. Both are 20, living with parents, and not ready for kids. The girlfriend is resistant to protection methods, relying on the pull-out method and her past experience. He's concerned about the risk, which is valid. But she's not willing to change her stance. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex. In relationships, consent and mutual agreement are key. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method and wants to use protection, and the other won't budge, there's a conflict. The author's concern is about responsibility and avoiding pregnancy. If he can't reach a compromise, he has to decide if he can go along with her choice or not.\n\nReducing sex could be a way to enforce his boundaries, but it's a significant step. Is it fair? Well, if they can't agree, then one has to prioritize their own comfort. But is it selfish? It's a judgment call. If he feels that continuing without protection is a risk he can't accept, maybe he's not wrong to take a stand. However, communication is important. Maybe there's a middle ground they haven't found yet. \n\nBut since she's not open to other methods, maybe he has to decide if he's okay with the risk. The fact that she's been in a previous relationship without protection and is confident it's worked might make her feel it's safe. However, the author is worried about the statistics against the pull-out method. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he tries to reduce sex to push for safer practices, maybe it's a way to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy. However, using the threat of reduced intimacy might not be the healthiest approach. It could lead to resentment. Alternatively, if he's not comfortable with the current arrangement, maybe it's his right to set that boundary. \n\nI think the key is whether they can find a solution. If she's unwilling to consider any form of protection, then he has to decide if he can accept that risk. If not, then maybe reducing sex isn't wrong because he's protecting his own values and future. But the answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about relationships and autonomy. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong if he's making a decision to protect himself from a risk he deems too high, even if it affects the relationship. However, the method of doing so (reducing sex) could be a way to assert his needs, especially if communication isn't working. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
