I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple having sex without protection, and the author wants to stop or reduce sex to find a middle ground. The author is 20, as is his girlfriend. They're both living with parents and not ready for kids. He's tried to get them to use condoms, but she doesn't want to. The pull-out method is their current method.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is concerned about responsibility and safety regarding contraception. His girlfriend is resistant to using condoms or other methods, citing past experiences and personal preference. He feels she's being irrational, but he's also worried about being selfish by cutting back on sex. The question is whether he's in the wrong if he reduces sex until they find a compromise.\n\nSo, the main ethical and relationship considerations. In a consensual relationship, both partners should agree on the level of risk they're comfortable with. The author is trying to protect himself from an unwanted pregnancy, which is a valid concern. However, using the pull-out method is less reliable. The author is not forcing her to use any method, but he's trying to set boundaries for his own safety. \n\nIs it wrong to reduce sex in order to find a compromise? If both parties agree to not use protection, but one partner changes their mind, it's his right to set boundaries, even if it means less sex. But is it fair to reduce sex as a form of pressure? That might be seen as using sex as leverage, which can be problematic. However, if he's not pressuring her to use condoms but rather deciding for himself, maybe he's within his rights. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's stance: she's not using any protection, and he's tried to find a middle ground (condoms, birth control, female condoms), but she refuses. He's trying to communicate his concerns, which is important in a relationship. If she's not willing to even consider alternatives, maybe the author is justified in seeking a compromise that respects his boundaries. \n\nBut maybe the author should try to find another solution first, like emergency contraception as a backup, or maybe counseling to discuss their differing views. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong for reducing sex. In that case, I think he's not in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own well-being and is trying to find a solution. It's a matter of mutual respect and communication. If they can't agree, then adjusting the frequency of sex to accommodate his concerns is a valid approach. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
