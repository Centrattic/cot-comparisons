I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to use protection during sex with his girlfriend, but she's resistant. He's considering reducing or stopping sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wants to avoid pregnancy and is concerned about their young age and financial/emotional readiness. His girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms, relies on pull-out, and has been in a similar situation before. She's mentioned not liking condoms and feeling they don't feel as good. She's also mentioned that she's never gotten pregnant in her previous relationship without using condoms, implying she thinks it's safe. The author feels she's being irrational and is conflicted about imposing his will on their sex life but also wants to be responsible.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong if he decides to reduce or stop having sex. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. Communication: Have they discussed this thoroughly? The author mentions bringing it up again, leading to arguments. They've also talked about other methods like the pill and female condoms, which she's against. So, communication exists, but it's not resolving the issue.\n2. Mutual consent and compromise: The author is trying to find a solution they both agree on. The girlfriend is resistant to all forms of protection except pull-out. The author feels she's not taking his concerns seriously. Is it fair for him to stop sex to push for protection?\n3. Responsibility and health: The author is being responsible by wanting to prevent pregnancy. The girlfriend's method is less reliable. However, the author isn't forcing her, just considering reducing sex until they agree.\n4. Autonomy: The author is making a choice to protect himself but is this a right choice if it affects their relationship? Is it fair to his partner's preferences?\n\nIn a relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and health. The author is not forcing his partner to use protection; he's considering reducing their sexual activity to avoid risk. However, reducing or stopping sex because of a disagreement might be seen as a form of coercion, especially if it's a power play. But since they are both adults and have agreed to be in a relationship, each has the autonomy to set their own boundaries. \n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that she's not willing to use any protection, which the author finds risky. The author's solution is to reduce sex until they find a middle ground. This could be a valid approach if communication is ongoing and there's mutual respect. However, if one partner is using the threat of reducing intimacy as a way to force the other into compliance, that's problematic. But in this case, the author seems to be seeking a compromise, not ultimatums.\n\nAnother angle: The author is concerned about potential pregnancy and wants to avoid it. The girlfriend's method is less safe, and he's trying to protect both of them. If he's not comfortable with the risk, reducing or stopping sex to find a safer method isn't necessarily wrong. However, if the girlfriend is not open to any solution, the author might need to prioritize his own well-being, even if it means the relationship can't continue as is.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries for his own health and future. The girlfriend is within her rights to refuse certain methods, but the author's decision to reduce sex to avoid an unwanted pregnancy isn't selfish if he's clear about his needs and they're discussed openly. The key here is whether the author is acting out of self-preservation and mutual respect, which he seems to be. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
