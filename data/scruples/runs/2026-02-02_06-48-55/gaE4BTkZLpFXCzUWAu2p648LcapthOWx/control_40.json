I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend due to the lack of protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents, and not ready for kids. The author wanted to use condoms, but the girlfriend refused, using the pull-out method instead. They had arguments, and now the author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual agreement, and the health of the relationship. The author is expressing concern about unplanned pregnancy and has tried discussing alternatives like female condoms or birth control, which she's also against. The author feels her stance is irrational.\n\nNow, considering ethical and relationship dynamics: In a healthy relationship, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. The girlfriend's refusal to use any protection despite the author's concerns might be selfish if it puts both at risk. However, the author is also considering reducing sex, which could be seen as a form of withholding affection or manipulating the situation.\n\nBut wait, the author is trying to communicate their needs and is concerned about their future. They're not forcing the girlfriend, but trying to find a compromise. The girlfriend is not budging, so the author's decision to reduce intimacy might be a way to prioritize their own boundaries and safety. \n\nHowever, using withdrawal from sex as a punishment or pressure could be seen as selfish too. The author needs to ensure their actions don't harm the relationship or become coercive. They should explore other options, maybe counseling or revisiting the conversation with a medical professional.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: The girlfriend isn't using protection, which risks both partners. The author is trying to address it. But the author's solution might not be the best approach. So, is the author wrong? They aren't wrong for wanting protection, but their method of reducing sex without mutual agreement could be problematic. However, given the context, maybe the answer leans towards B (not wrong) because the author is acting in their own safety.\n"
