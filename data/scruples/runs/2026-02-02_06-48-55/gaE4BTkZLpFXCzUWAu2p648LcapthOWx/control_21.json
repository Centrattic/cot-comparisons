I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they're not using protection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, and they're not using any protection except the pull-out method. The guy wants to use condoms for safety, but the girl doesn't want to. She's been in past relationships without condoms and hasn't gotten pregnant, so she's not worried. The guy feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing their sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, mutual agreement, and responsibility. The guy is concerned about unplanned pregnancy because they can't support a child financially or emotionally. The girl is resistant to using condoms because of personal preference and past experiences. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex until they can agree on a safer method.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should agree on safety measures. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current arrangement, they have the right to express that. However, reducing sex as a consequence might be a form of coercion or ultimatum, which could be seen as selfish or a breach of communication. On the other hand, he's prioritizing his own values and safety, which is valid.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's communicating his concerns and they can't find a compromise, it's his right to set boundaries. However, abruptly reducing sex might be seen as using sex as a bargaining chip, which isn't healthy. The ideal solution would be to work together on finding a method they both accept. Since she's open to nothing else and he's unwilling to risk pregnancy without protection, maybe he's justified in his stance. But if he's not giving her a chance to come around or compromise, he might be overstepping.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No), because he's not in the wrong for wanting to protect himself, but the way he's addressing it could be improved with better communication. However, according to the question's options, the answer depends on if he's wrong. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, and given that he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his safety, the answer is B.\n"
