I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not using protection, and the guy wants to start using condoms, but the girl is resistant. The author is considering reducing or stopping sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. They've been together over a year, both 20, no financial stability for kids. The guy wants protection; she doesn't, using the pull-out method. They've had arguments about it. She's been with someone else before without condoms and hasn't gotten pregnant. She doesn't like condoms' feel. The guy feels she's being irrational and is thinking of reducing sex until they agree.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo decide, I should consider consent, mutual agreement in relationships, health risks, and communication. Contraception is a shared responsibility. Both partners need to agree on methods. The guy is concerned about unintended pregnancy and wants protection. The girl is against it, citing past experiences and preference. \n\nThe author is considering reducing sex to push for a compromise. Is that fair? The problem is that he's using withdrawal as a method, which isn't reliable. The girl is resistant to other methods. The author's intention is to protect both from an unplanned pregnancy, which is reasonable. However, reducing sex without agreement might be seen as a power move.\n\nBut in a relationship, both should communicate needs. If the guy can't convince her to use protection and feels uncomfortable with her current method, he has the right to set boundaries. However, reducing sex might be seen as a form of coercion unless it's discussed and agreed upon. The key here is whether he's acting out of self-respect and mutual safety or controlling the relationship. \n\nSince he's trying to find a middle ground, his approach is about protecting both. If he's not in the wrong, it's because he's respecting his own boundaries and health. However, if he's using withdrawal of affection as leverage without discussing, that could be problematic. But given the context, he's trying to find a solution where both can agree, which is reasonable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But need to check if his actions are reasonable given the health risks.\n"
