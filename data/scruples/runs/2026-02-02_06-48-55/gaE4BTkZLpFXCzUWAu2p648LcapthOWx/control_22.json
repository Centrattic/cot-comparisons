I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they're not using protection. The situation is that they've been together over a year, both 20, not ready for kids. The guy wants condoms, she doesn't, uses the pull-out method. He's frustrated because she's not taking it seriously, and he's thinking about reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the key points. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and has tried to communicate his needs. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms or other methods, relying on pull-out, which is less effective. He's feeling conflicted because he wants to protect them both but also doesn't want to impose his will.\n\nSo, from a responsibility standpoint, the author is trying to be proactive about safety. The girlfriend's argument is based on past experience and preference, which might not account for the risks involved. The author is considering reducing sex as a last resort because communication hasn't resolved the issue. \n\nIs reducing sex a form of coercion? Maybe. If he's using it as a way to pressure her into using protection, that could be a problem. But if he's trying to set a boundary for his own comfort and safety, it might be justified. The key is whether he's respecting her autonomy while standing by his own needs. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they've discussed alternatives like birth control and female condoms, which she's not open to. That shows he's tried to find solutions that accommodate both parties. If she's unwilling to compromise, then the author's need to set a boundary for his own peace of mind is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, reducing sex without mutual agreement could be seen as manipulative. But given the high stakes of an unintended pregnancy, his concern is valid. The question is whether his action is reasonable given their inability to reach an agreement. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate and meet halfway. If she's not willing to do that, it's tough on the other person. The author's intention seems to be protecting both of them, so he's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
