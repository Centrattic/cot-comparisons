I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. \n\nFirst, the context: They're both 20, in a one-year relationship, have been using the pull-out method without condoms. The guy wants to use condoms for safety, but the girl resists, saying she doesn't like how they feel and that she's been fine before. He feels she's being irrational, but he doesn't want to impose, yet feels it's the responsible choice.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong to consider reducing sex until they find a middle ground. \n\nHmm. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. Both partners have different needs and concerns. The guy is worried about pregnancy and wants protection, which is a valid concern. The girl doesn't like condoms and is resistant to other methods like the pill or female condoms. \n\nIs reducing sex a reasonable step? Well, if they can't find a compromise, maybe it's his way of protecting himself. But on the other hand, using sex as a bargaining chip can be problematic. It might lead to resentment or feel like a punishment. \n\nAlso, the pull-out method isn't 100% effective, so his concern is reasonable. She's been lucky, but that doesn't mean it's safe. He's not trying to control her, just ensuring they're both safe. However, he's also considering reducing sex, which could be seen as a form of coercion if it's done to pressure her into using protection. \n\nBut if he's approaching it as a way to give both time to find a solution that works for them, maybe it's not wrong. It's about mutual respect and safety. The key is whether he communicates his intentions clearly and without ultimatums. If he's open to discussion and not just cutting things off, it might be a reasonable approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's autonomy is important too. She has her preferences and past experiences. The guy needs to respect her feelings while advocating for his own safety. Maybe there's a middle ground they haven't found yet, like a different contraceptive method that both agree on. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's doing this to protect himself and not to punish her, perhaps not. But if he's using it as a tactic to force her hand, then yes. The answer might depend on the nuance of his approach. Since he's stating he wants to find a middle ground, maybe A (he's in the wrong) isn't the case. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to prioritize safety while seeking a compromise.\n"
