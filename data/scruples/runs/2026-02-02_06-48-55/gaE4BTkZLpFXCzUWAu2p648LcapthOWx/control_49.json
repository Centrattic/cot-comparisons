I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to not using protection. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20, living with parents. The author wants to use condoms because they can't handle kids right now. The girlfriend doesn't use them, uses pull-out, and argues that she's been fine in the past. She doesn't like condoms' feel and thinks they're unnecessary. They've discussed other methods like birth control and female condoms, but she's against those too.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He feels she's being irrational but doesn't want to be selfish by imposing his will. The question is whether he's wrong to consider reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, evaluating the situation: The author's concern is valid. Condoms are a standard form of protection, and the girlfriend's argument that she's been lucky before isn't a guarantee. The pull-out method isn't reliable. The author wants to prevent pregnancy, which is responsible. The girlfriend's refusal to use any protection despite the risks could be seen as not respecting his concerns. \n\nBut the author is considering reducing sex, which is a significant step. Is that fair? Well, he's trying to find a middle ground, so maybe it's a way to prioritize his own needs while pushing for a solution. However, communication is key. Have they tried all possible solutions? They mentioned condoms, female condoms, birth control. If she's unwilling to budge, maybe the author's actions are a last resort. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Not necessarily. He's taking responsibility for the situation. The girlfriend isn't meeting him halfway. The author isn't forcing her but is trying to set boundaries for his own comfort. But reducing sex could be seen as a punishment. However, given the high-stakes issue of pregnancy, it's a valid approach. \n\nSo, answer B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's acting in good faith to prevent an unwanted pregnancy and is seeking a compromise despite her resistance.\n"
