I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with his girlfriend due to not using protection. \n\nFirst, the situation: the couple has been together over a year, both 20, using the pull-out method. The guy wants to use condoms, the girl doesn't. She's had past relationships without condoms and hasn't gotten pregnant. She doesn't like how they feel. They've discussed other methods like birth control and female condoms, but she's not interested.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He feels she's being irrational, but also worries about imposing his wishes. He's considering reducing their sex to find a middle ground.\n\nNow, determining if he's in the wrong. The key points are mutual consent and communication. The author is trying to express his concerns about unprotected sex and potential pregnancy, which is a valid health and safety issue. He's tried discussing alternatives, but she's resistant. The question is whether he's justified in adjusting the frequency of their sex to protect his own boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have a say in their sexual health. The author isn't forcing her to use protection but is advocating for his needs. If communication isn't working, reducing sex might be a way to prioritize his own comfort and responsibility. However, it could be seen as a power play if not discussed properly. Since he's considering this as a middle ground after multiple discussions, it might be a reasonable step to protect his own interests while respecting her current stance. So, he might not be in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
