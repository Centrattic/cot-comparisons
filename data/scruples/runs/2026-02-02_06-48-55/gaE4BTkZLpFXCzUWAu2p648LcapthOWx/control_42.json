I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend due to differing opinions on contraception.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20, living with parents, not ready for kids. The author has tried to use condoms but the girlfriend refuses, using the pull-out method. She's against condoms because of preference and past experience. They've discussed other methods like birth control and female condoms, which she also isn't interested in. The author feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is wrong. In relationships, communication and mutual agreement are key. The author has tried to discuss the issue multiple times and the girlfriend isn't budging. The author's concern is valid\u2014unprotected sex without reliable methods increases pregnancy risk. The girlfriend's stance is based on personal preference and past luck, which isn't a solid safety net. \n\nThe author's decision to reduce sex isn't about control but about personal boundaries and safety. It's important to consider if this decision is respectful. The author isn't cutting off sex entirely but reducing it to find a solution. If the author communicates this clearly, not as a punishment but as a necessary step for their own comfort, it's more about self-respect and responsibility. \n\nHowever, there's a line where it could be seen as coercive. But given that they're both adults, and the author is seeking a compromise, it's a matter of mutual respect. The girlfriend is not using any protection she's willing to accept, so the author's choice to set boundaries to protect their own interests isn't necessarily wrong. They need to make sure they're not pressuring her into methods she's against, but rather looking for alternatives they can agree on. \n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking responsibility for their health and future, which is a valid reason to set boundaries.\n"
