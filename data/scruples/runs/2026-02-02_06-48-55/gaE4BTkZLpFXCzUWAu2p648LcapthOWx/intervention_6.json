I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce having sex with their girlfriend because they disagree on protection methods. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20, living with parents, and they don't use protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried suggesting condoms before, but the girlfriend is against them, citing past relationships and not liking the feel. They've also discussed other methods like birth control or female condoms, but she's not interested. The author is now considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility to protect themselves from unintended pregnancy and STIs. Since both are young and not in a position to have children, the author's concern is valid. The girlfriend isn't willing to compromise, so the author feels they need to take action to prevent pregnancy. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the right to reduce sex. Legally and ethically, both partners have the right to make decisions about their bodies. However, not using protection without both agreeing can be risky. The author is trying to protect themselves, which is reasonable. If the girlfriend refuses all forms of protection, the author might be justified in limiting sex to avoid the risk. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of communication. The author should have tried more to understand her stance and maybe explore other methods. However, they've already discussed birth control and female condoms, which she rejected. The author is now considering reducing sex, which could be seen as a way to prioritize their own well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, stopping sex entirely might be seen as a drastic measure without resolving the underlying issue. The author should ideally seek counseling or find another compromise, but if that's not possible, their decision to protect themselves isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to prevent pregnancy and STIs, which are valid concerns, and the girlfriend isn't willing to budge. The author's action is a way to manage their own risk in the situation.\n"
