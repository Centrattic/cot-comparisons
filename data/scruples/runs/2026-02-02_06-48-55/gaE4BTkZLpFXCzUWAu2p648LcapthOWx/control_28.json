I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a couple who've been together for over a year, both 20 years old. They're not using protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to insist on condoms before because they don't want kids right now, but the girlfriend didn't agree. Now he's feeling conflicted again, she's being resistant to using any protection, and he's thinking about reducing their sex to find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're both young, living with parents, so economic and emotional readiness isn't there. The author wants to prevent pregnancy, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's argument is that she never used condoms before and hasn't gotten pregnant, so she's not convinced it's necessary. She doesn't like how condoms feel and thinks the pull-out method is enough, even though he points out that's not reliable. She also says if he uses condoms, there's no point because he'll still pull out, implying maybe she doesn't trust his commitment to the method.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong if he reduces their sex until they find a middle ground. Let's break down the sides. The author is trying to protect both of them from unintended pregnancy, which is a responsible stance. The girlfriend is resisting any form of protection, which could lead to a pregnancy they're not ready for. The author is feeling that she's being irrational, but he's also considering cutting back on sex to avoid conflict or pressure her. \n\nIs reducing sex a form of punishment or coercion? If he's doing it unilaterally without discussing it with her, maybe. But he's saying he wants to find a middle ground, so perhaps it's a way to create space for them to talk. However, withdrawing from sex could be seen as using emotional manipulation if it's to force her to comply. Alternatively, it's his way of prioritizing his own boundaries and safety. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is risky. Even if she's been lucky before, that doesn't mean it won't happen. She's not open to alternatives like birth control or female condoms. The author is trying to balance his own needs with the relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual consent and communication. If he's reducing sex without her knowledge, maybe that's not fair. But if he's doing it as a way to make her reconsider and find a solution, then it's his right to set boundaries. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have a role. The author is trying to prevent a pregnancy, which is responsible. The girlfriend isn't, which is a risk. The author's action to reduce sex might be his way of protecting himself. But is it fair to reduce sex as a consequence? It could be seen as a form of negotiation, but it's a bit of a passive-aggressive tactic. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author has tried discussing it multiple times. If she's not budging, he might feel he has to take action to protect himself. So, is he in the wrong? Maybe not. It's a tough spot, but his intention is to prevent a pregnancy, which is a valid concern. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no other angle. If he's using the reduced sex to pressure her into using protection, that's manipulation. But if he's doing it to protect himself and is open to finding a middle ground, then it's his choice. So B might be correct.\n"
