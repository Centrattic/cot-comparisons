I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong when considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to not using protection. The situation is that they've been together for over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents, and they don't use condoms except the pull-out method. The author has tried to insist on condoms before, but the girlfriend doesn't want to use them, citing past experiences and discomfort. Now the author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concern is about the risk of unintended pregnancy, especially given their age and financial situation. Using the pull-out method is less effective than condoms, so his worry is valid. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her preferences are being dismissed, and she may not be comfortable with condoms, which can affect the intimacy and satisfaction in the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication, mutual consent, and compromise. The author is trying to communicate his concerns, but it seems like there's a lack of mutual agreement. The girlfriend's stance is that she's been fine without condoms before and doesn't want to use them. The author feels she's being irrational, but it's possible she's feeling pressured or that her needs aren't being respected.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex. Legally and ethically, both partners should have autonomy over their bodies and decisions. However, in a relationship, both should be on the same page regarding sexual health. If the author feels that the risk is too high and they can't find a middle ground (like using female condoms or birth control), then he might feel justified in adjusting their sexual activity. But does that make him in the wrong? \n\nIf the author stops or reduces sex unilaterally without discussing and reaching a mutual decision, it could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her feelings. Conversely, if they can't agree on a safe method, the author might be within his rights to prioritize his own comfort and safety. The challenge is balancing personal boundaries with respecting the partner's autonomy.\n\nPossible middle grounds they could explore: maybe using female condoms if she's more comfortable, or discussing emergency contraception as a backup. But since she's not open to those options, the author might feel he has no choice but to act in his own best interest. However, reducing sex could be seen as a form of coercion if it's done without proper communication, but the author is trying to find a middle ground, which suggests he's still open to negotiation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is taking initiative to prevent a situation he deems risky. However, the girlfriend's refusal to use any protection beyond the pull-out method could be seen as putting both of them at risk, especially if he's not comfortable with it. So, the author's actions might be a way to protect himself, but it's a sensitive issue that requires empathy and understanding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's trying to protect himself from a situation he finds risky. On the other hand, reducing sex could be seen as imposing his will. However, since they haven't reached a mutual agreement and he's trying to find a middle ground, it's possible he's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because he's taking responsibility for his own boundaries and well-being, especially when the other person isn't willing to compromise. But I need to make sure I'm not overlooking aspects of consent or mutual decision-making here. The key is that they should have mutual consent on sexual activities, including birth control methods. If the author is uncomfortable continuing without protection, it's his right to express that and even choose to adjust their intimacy until they can agree. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
