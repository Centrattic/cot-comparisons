I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection.\n\nFirst, the situation: Both are 20, in a one-year relationship. They use the pull-out method but no condoms. The man wants to use protection for financial and emotional reasons, while the woman insists the pull-out is enough and doesn't like condoms. They've had arguments about it, and she's resistant to other methods like the pill or female condoms.\n\nThe author is conflicted. They feel it's irresponsible but don't want to be selfish by cutting down on sex. The question is whether they are wrong for considering this action.\n\nKey points to consider: Communication is a big factor here. The author has tried discussing it multiple times. The woman's stance is that she's been fine before and doesn't like condoms. The man is trying to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern. The woman, on the other hand, might feel her autonomy is being challenged.\n\nIs it the author's fault for prioritizing safety? The pull-out method isn't reliable, and the author is concerned about potential pregnancy. But the woman is also making a choice based on her past experiences and preferences. The author is trying to find a middle ground, but she's not open to alternatives.\n\nReducing sex could be seen as a way to protect both parties from unwanted consequences. However, it's important to consider if this decision is communicated respectfully and if both are working towards a compromise. The author might be in a dilemma between their values and the relationship's dynamics.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author is acting out of concern for both their well-being, it's not necessarily wrong. But if they're being controlling without considering the partner's feelings, that could be problematic. The key is mutual consent and understanding. The author's approach might be justified given the risks involved, but they should ensure their actions are communicated clearly and with empathy.\n"
