I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. \n\nFirst, the situation: Both are 20, in a year-long relationship. They use the pull-out method without condoms. The author wants to use condoms for safety, but the girlfriend refuses, saying she's never used them before and doesn't like the feeling. She's confident in her past experience without pregnancy. The author feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground.\n\nThe key points are consent, communication, and mutual respect. Condoms are a form of protection against pregnancy and STIs. The author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy due to economic and emotional readiness. The girlfriend, however, is resistant to using condoms and other methods. \n\nThe author's plan to reduce sex until they find a middle ground raises questions. Is it fair to reduce intimacy as a way to pressure the girlfriend into using protection? Or is the author trying to protect both of them from potential consequences they can't handle? \n\nFrom a health perspective, not using protection is risky. The girlfriend's argument that she's been lucky before isn't reliable. The author is trying to address a valid safety concern. However, using the threat of reducing sex might be seen as a form of coercion if not handled carefully. \n\nBut the author isn't using force; they're considering a change to protect both parties. The question is whether it's the author's right to prioritize their own and their partner's well-being by setting boundaries. In healthy relationships, both partners should communicate and compromise. If the girlfriend is unwilling to consider any form of protection, the author might be justified in setting limits to prevent risks they can't manage. \n\nOn the other hand, reducing sex could be seen as a punitive measure if not discussed openly. However, given the serious implications of unplanned pregnancy, the author's concern is valid. The answer might hinge on whether the author is acting out of self-interest or genuine concern for both partners' future.\n"
