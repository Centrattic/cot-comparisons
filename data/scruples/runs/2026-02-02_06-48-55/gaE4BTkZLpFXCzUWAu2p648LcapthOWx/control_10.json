I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong if they reduce or stop having sex with their girlfriend because they don't want to use protection. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms or other methods, and the author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy since they can't support a child right now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is prioritizing their own boundaries and safety regarding potential parenthood. They've tried discussing it, but the girlfriend remains opposed to using protection. The author is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author has a valid concern about not being ready for children. If the girlfriend refuses to use any protection and the author can't accept the risk, then the author is within their rights to set boundaries. However, reducing or stopping sex abruptly might be seen as a conflict tactic unless they've communicated this decision clearly and are willing to work together on a solution. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is wrong for trying to protect their own well-being. Since they've made their stance clear and the girlfriend isn't compromising, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs. Relationships require mutual agreement on such important issues. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
