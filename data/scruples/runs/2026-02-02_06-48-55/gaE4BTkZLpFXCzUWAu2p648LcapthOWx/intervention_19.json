I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they don't use protection. The situation is that they've been together over a year, both 20, and not using protection except pull-out. The author has tried to use condoms before but she didn't like them, and they ended up not using them. Now he's feeling unsafe and wants to reduce sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and possibly STIs. He's young and not ready for kids, which is a valid point. On the other hand, the girlfriend is not willing to use protection, citing past relationships without issues and discomfort with condoms. She might feel that the author is being controlling or not trusting her. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to want to reduce sex. The key here is communication and mutual consent. If both are in agreement on the current method, but the author now feels it's unsafe, he has a right to express his concerns. However, reducing sex without agreement might be seen as a power move. The author's intention is to find a middle ground, but if the girlfriend is unwilling, he's at a standstill. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as responsible, prioritizing safety, but the method of reducing sex could be problematic if it's unilateral. It's important whether they discussed this thoroughly. If he communicated his concerns and she's still unwilling, maybe he's justified. But if he's using this to control the relationship without compromise, then it's wrong. \n\nAlso, considering that they're both adults and have the right to make decisions about their bodies. The author's health and future are important, but so is the girlfriend's autonomy. The answer hinges on whether reducing sex is a fair response when mutual agreement isn't possible. Since the author is trying to find a middle ground but hasn't succeeded, maybe it's a reasonable step. But if it's done without discussion or respect for her feelings, it's wrong. The story mentions he's tried discussing, so maybe A (in the wrong) or B (not). \n\nI think the author is in the right because he's prioritizing his safety and future, even if it affects their relationship. However, the ethical angle is about mutual respect. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, perhaps he's in the wrong. Since she's unwilling to consider any protection, and he's not ready to risk, maybe he's justified. But reducing sex without consent might be controlling. Hmm. The original question says the user thinks the author is wrong, but I'm not sure. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
