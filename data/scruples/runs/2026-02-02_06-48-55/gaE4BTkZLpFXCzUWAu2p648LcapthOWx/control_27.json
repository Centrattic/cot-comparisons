I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents, and not ready for kids. The author wants to use condoms because they're worried about pregnancy and the current life situation. The girlfriend refuses, citing past relationships without condoms, dislikes the feel, and argues the pull-out method is enough. She's also against other methods like birth control or female condoms. They've had arguments about this, and the author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author's concern is valid\u2014unprotected sex carries risks, especially for young people not financially or emotionally ready for children. They're trying to protect both of them. On the other hand, the girlfriend's preferences and comfort are also important. She's expressed her stance, and the author is frustrated because they feel she's being irrational.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual agreement. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries for their own safety. However, the approach might need to be considered. Reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a way to enforce their will, which might not be the healthiest approach. Open communication and finding a compromise are usually recommended in relationships. But since the girlfriend isn't willing to budge, the author is trying to find a solution that works for both. The author's intention is to protect both of them, which is a responsible stance. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's also a need for empathy and understanding in how this is handled.\n"
