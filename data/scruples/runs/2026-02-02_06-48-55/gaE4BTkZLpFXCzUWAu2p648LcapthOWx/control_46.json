I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for Airing) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20 and living with their parents. They use the pull-out method but no other protection. The author has tried to use condoms before, but the girlfriend didn't want to. Now, the author is feeling more concerned about the risks and wants to address it again. The girlfriend argues that she's been fine in the past, doesn't like condom feel, and thinks using them is pointless. They've discussed other methods like birth control pills or female condoms, which she's not interested in.\n\nThe author is conflicted between their responsibility to avoid an unintended pregnancy and not wanting to be selfish by suddenly imposing new constraints. They're considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is justified in changing their behavior based on their own comfort and responsibility. From a health and safety perspective, not using protection increases the risk of pregnancy and STIs. The girlfriend's stance is based on past experience and personal preference, but the author feels that's not enough. \n\nThe question is about whether the author would be in the wrong. Legally, there's no obligation here unless there's a specific context, but ethically, it's about mutual consent and shared responsibility. The author is trying to communicate their concerns and wants a solution that both agree on. If the girlfriend is unwilling to consider any form of protection, the author has the right to set boundaries to protect their own interests. \n\nHowever, the author should also consider the relationship dynamics. Abruptly reducing or stopping sex without a clear discussion might seem like a sudden imposition, even if it's for a good reason. The key is whether both parties are in agreement. Since the author has already tried to discuss it and faced resistance, they might be seeking a compromise. \n\nIn this case, the author isn't forcing the issue but is instead trying to find a middle ground. Their actions are based on personal responsibility and trying to avoid a situation they're not prepared for. The girlfriend's refusal to use any protection could be seen as a risk, but the author's right to prioritize their own well-being is important. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves and seeking a mutual agreement. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any key points. The author's intention is to reduce the risk, which is understandable, especially considering their age and living situation. The girlfriend's argument is that she's had no issues before, but that doesn't account for current circumstances. The author's approach is to find a compromise, which is responsible. Therefore, they aren't wrong for considering this step.\n"
