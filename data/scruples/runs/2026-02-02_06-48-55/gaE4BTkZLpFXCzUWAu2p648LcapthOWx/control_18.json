I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with his girlfriend due to their lack of protection.\n\nFirst, the situation: they've been together over a year, both 20, using pull-out method. He wants condoms; she doesn't, arguing that she's never used them before and was fine. They've had arguments about it. He's worried about unplanned pregnancy and their current life situation. Now he's thinking about reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, they're both adults and should be able to make decisions together. But consent and mutual agreement are key. If he's trying to reduce sex because of his own comfort and safety, it's his choice. However, he needs to communicate clearly and consider her feelings. If he unilaterally decides without discussion, that could be wrong. But he mentions trying to find middle ground, which is good. Also, he's concerned about responsibility. Using no protection is a risk, and wanting to use protection is reasonable. She's not open to other methods like pills or female condoms, which complicates things. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering reducing sex. If he's doing it to prioritize his own boundaries and safety, it's not wrong. However, if he's being controlling or not respecting her boundaries, that's different. But the scenario shows he's tried discussing and compromising. So maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
