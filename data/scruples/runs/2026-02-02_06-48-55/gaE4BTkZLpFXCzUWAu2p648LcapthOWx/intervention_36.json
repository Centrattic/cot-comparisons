I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"What Would You Do\" scenario is in the wrong if they decide to reduce or stop having sex with their girlfriend because she refuses to use condoms. The author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy but the girlfriend is against using protection, relying on the pull-out method and past experience. They've had arguments about it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation based on consent and mutual agreement in a relationship. In healthy relationships, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. The boyfriend is worried about the risks, which is valid. The girlfriend, however, isn't willing to use condoms or other methods, citing past experience and preference. \n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend is in the wrong for wanting to protect himself. If the girlfriend isn't willing to use any form of protection that he's comfortable with, then his decision to reduce or stop sexual activity until they find a compromise might be justified. However, forcing a partner to stop sex could be seen as a withdrawal of consent based on his own safety concerns. \n\nBut is it selfish? If the boyfriend is genuinely concerned about his ability to handle a pregnancy and has communicated this, then prioritizing his own well-being isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014potentially reducing sex without a middle ground\u2014might affect the relationship. The girlfriend's stance is also a factor; if she's unwilling to consider alternatives like birth control pills or female condoms, that's her choice, but it's important to respect each other's boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on mutual consent and compromise. If the boyfriend is trying to protect himself from an outcome he's not ready for, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he's imposing his will without dialogue, that could be problematic. But in this case, he's tried communication and is seeking a middle ground. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
