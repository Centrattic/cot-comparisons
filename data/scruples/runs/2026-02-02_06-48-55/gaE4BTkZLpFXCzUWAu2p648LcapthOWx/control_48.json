I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who've been together over a year, both 20, and they're having unprotected sex using the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms or some protection because they can't handle kids right now. The girlfriend doesn't want to use them, says she's never used them before, and the pull-out is enough. She also mentions not liking the feel of condoms. They've argued about it, and the author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is wrong for wanting to use protection. From a health and safety perspective, not using protection is risky, especially for STIs and unintended pregnancy. The pull-out method isn't very reliable. The author's concern is valid. But the question is if the author is wrong for possibly reducing sex to enforce this.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is resistant. The author is trying to communicate their needs but she's not budging. The author's solution is to reduce or stop sex until they agree. Is that fair? It's a form of withholding intimacy to get their way. In relationships, using sex as leverage can be problematic. It might be seen as a form of emotional manipulation if not done carefully. However, the author's intention is to protect both of them from potential risks. \n\nBut is withholding sex an appropriate response? Some might say it's their right to set boundaries for their own health. Others might argue that it's not the right approach without mutual agreement. Also, the author is considering this out of concern for their future, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that she's been fine before and doesn't want to use protection. The author is trying to compromise by suggesting condoms, but she's not willing. He's also offered alternatives like female condoms or birth control, which she rejects.\n\nThe key here is mutual consent and respect. If the author stops or reduces sex, is that inconsiderate? Or is it a necessary step to avoid a risky situation? It's a tough call. In some ethical frameworks, protecting oneself from harm is a priority. But in a relationship, communication and compromise are essential. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to address a legitimate concern. However, if they unilaterally decide to stop sex without the girlfriend's input, that could be seen as selfish or manipulative. \n\nBut the author mentions they've tried discussing it and the girlfriend isn't budging. They're not just suddenly stopping; they're considering reducing sex to find a middle ground. The answer might hinge on whether setting boundaries around sexual activity to prevent unwanted pregnancy is reasonable. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend feels pressured, that's another issue. It's a complex situation where both partners have valid points. The author's responsibility is to their own health and future, so they're not in the wrong for wanting to take precautions. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
