I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to their lack of protection. The main issue is about using the pull-out method without other protection. The author has tried discussing condoms, birth control, and female condoms, but the girlfriend is against it. He's conflicted between his desire to avoid pregnancy and not wanting to force the issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects. The author is concerned about responsibility and the risks involved. He's communicated his stance and tried to find compromises, but they haven't reached an agreement. The girlfriend's stance is that she doesn't see the need for protection, relying on past luck and the pull-out method. \n\nIn relationships, consent and mutual agreement on such matters are crucial. The author isn't forcing her but is looking to take a step back to protect himself. Is that selfish? Or is it responsible? It depends on perspective. He's not being coercive but is setting boundaries for his own safety. \n\nHowever, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a withdrawal of intimacy, which might be a valid response to a significant issue. The wrong here would depend on intent. If he's doing it to pressure her into using protection, that's more controlling. But if he's doing it to protect himself and has communicated that clearly without ultimatums, it's more about self-responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's refusal to consider any protection might not be irrational, but the author isn't in the wrong to prioritize his own risk assessment. They might need to seek counseling or find another solution. The key is that the author hasn't acted yet, just contemplating. The question is whether he would be wrong if he proceeds. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should share the burden. If the author can't find a middle ground and feels the risk is too high, taking a step back isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B: No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
