I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong if they decide to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend because she refuses to use condoms or other protection. The author is 20, in a one-year relationship, and both are living with their parents. They've been using the pull-out method, but the author is concerned about the risks. The girlfriend argues that she's been okay without condoms before and doesn't like how they feel. The author feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is trying to be responsible and avoid an unintended pregnancy, especially since they can't support a child economically or emotionally. They've tried discussing it, and the arguments keep coming up. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has her own reasons\u2014past experience, preference for the pull-out method, dislike of condom texture. She might not see the risk as high as the author does.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by potentially reducing or stopping sex. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and consent. The author is trying to express their needs and safety concerns, which is valid. However, making a unilateral decision to reduce sex could be seen as a form of coercion if it's not a mutual agreement. The author hasn't mentioned discussing this specific plan with the girlfriend, so there might be a lack of communication. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should be on the same page about sexual health. The author's concern is reasonable, but enforcing their will without compromise might cross a line. The girlfriend's refusal to use protection could be a deal-breaker for the author, but reducing sex without discussion might be perceived as punishment or manipulation. \n\nAlso, considering they're both young and might be new to these conversations, there's a learning curve. The author needs to balance their safety with respecting their partner's autonomy. Maybe there's a middle ground, like a backup method or a trial period with condoms to see if the partner can adjust. However, the author hasn't explored all options, like emergency contraception or other forms of birth control. \n\nIn terms of ethical stance, if the author's main goal is to prevent pregnancy and their partner isn't willing to meet them halfway, the author might have a valid reason to reconsider the relationship dynamics. But using sex as a bargaining chip (withholding it to get the partner to comply) is a contentious tactic. It could be seen as a form of emotional manipulation, which is generally frowned upon. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is honest about their needs and the partner is unwilling to adapt, the author has the right to prioritize their own well-being. However, the method of doing so\u2014by reducing sex without mutual agreement\u2014could be problematic. The right answer hinges on whether the author's action is a reasonable self-advocacy step or an overreach.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author has exhausted all communication and compromise avenues. If they've tried multiple times and the partner remains unyielding, then the author's decision might be justified. But if the author hasn't fully discussed the consequences or considered alternative solutions, then their approach might be hasty. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is acting to protect their own future, but it's a close call.\n"
