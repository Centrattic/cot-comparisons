I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of a Reddit-style WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents, and not ready for kids. The guy has tried pushing for condoms before, but she's resistant, using the pull-out method. He feels it's unsafe, but she's adamant about not using protection. Now he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the core issue is about mutual consent and compromise in a relationship. The man is concerned about the risk of pregnancy without protection, while the woman is resistant to using condoms or other methods. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex to avoid an unwanted pregnancy.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, both partners should ideally agree on contraceptive methods. If they can't reach an agreement, one partner might feel justified in adjusting their behavior to align with their personal boundaries. However, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a conflict if it's done without considering the other's feelings or if it's a unilateral decision without trying all possible solutions.\n\nThe woman's resistance might stem from personal preferences (dislike of condoms), past experiences, or a sense of control over her body. The man is trying to protect his economic and emotional well-being. But relationships require compromise. If the woman is unwilling to use any form of protection, the man has to decide whether to accept the risk or adjust his actions. \n\nIs it selfish to impose a constraint? It's a matter of perspective. He's not imposing in a harmful way; he's setting a boundary to avoid a situation he's not ready for. However, communication is key. If he's been trying and she's not budge, maybe reducing sex is a valid step. On the flip side, if he stops without discussion, it could hurt the relationship. \n\nThe user (the original poster) thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the given info. Since both are trying to communicate and the woman isn't budging, the author's decision to reduce sex might be a reasonable boundary. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
