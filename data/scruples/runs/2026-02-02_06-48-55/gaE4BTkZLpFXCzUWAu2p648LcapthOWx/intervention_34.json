I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for considering reducing sex with their girlfriend because they don't use protection. The main issue here is about consent, communication, and mutual agreement in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend have been together for over a year. They're both 20, young, and living with their parents. They use the pull-out method but no other protection. The author wants to use condoms, the girlfriend doesn't. He feels she's being irrational, but he's also conflicted about imposing his will on their sex life.\n\nThe key points here are mutual consent and compromise. In a relationship, both partners need to agree on sexual health practices. The girlfriend is not willing to use any form of protection, which the author finds risky. However, the author is now considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground. The question is, is he in the wrong for doing that?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid concern about unintended pregnancy and is trying to protect both of them. It's responsible to want to avoid parenthood at this stage. On the other hand, reducing sex unilaterally could be seen as a form of coercion. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend and tried to find a solution that both can accept. If she's unwilling to use any form of protection, the author might need to set boundaries. But doing so without her input could damage the relationship. The author's approach might be a way to enforce his will without open communication, which could be problematic. However, given that they've tried to discuss it and haven't reached an agreement, maybe the author is justified in prioritizing his own comfort and safety. Ultimately, it's about mutual respect and finding a compromise. If the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise at all, the author might not be in the wrong for trying to protect himself by adjusting their sexual activity. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances here. The answer might hinge on whether the author is acting out of selfishness or genuine concern. The author feels it's the smart thing to do, so it's about responsibility. The girlfriend's stance is based on her past experiences and personal preferences. So, the author's decision to reduce sex could be a way to honor his own boundaries, which is okay as long as it's communicated clearly. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
