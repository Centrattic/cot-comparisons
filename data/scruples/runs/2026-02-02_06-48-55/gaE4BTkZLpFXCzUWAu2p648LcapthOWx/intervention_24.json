I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be The Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend over the use of protection.\n\nFirst, context: They've been together over a year, both 20, living with parents. They don't use protection except the pull-out method. The author has insisted on condoms before but she didn't agree, leading to arguments. Now, he's concerned about the risks and wants to change, but she resists. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nImportant points to consider: Communication in relationships, mutual consent, health and safety. The author is worried about unintended pregnancy and is trying to address it. His partner is resistant, citing past experiences and personal preferences. Condoms have lower effectiveness without the pull-out method, but they do reduce risk. The author is trying to compromise by suggesting condoms even if she doesn't like them, but she dismisses that.\n\nIs reducing sex a valid response? If the author feels unsafe without protection, he has the right to set boundaries. However, the approach should involve open communication and understanding. The key is whether he's acting unilaterally without considering her feelings. The question is if he's in the wrong by possibly reducing intimacy without resolving the issue through dialogue first.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. The author's intent is to protect both from unintended consequences. However, abruptly reducing sex might be seen as a form of pressure, especially if it's not discussed thoroughly. The partner's refusal to consider other methods like the pill or female condoms complicates things.\n\nEthically, both have a right to their preferences, but health and safety are important. The author isn't forcing her to use condoms but is seeking a compromise. If he's considering reducing sex as a way to push her to agree, that could be seen as manipulation. However, if he's doing it to protect himself and they haven't found a middle ground yet, it might be a reasonable step, though ideally discussed more thoroughly.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are respectful and communicated properly. If he's not being coercive and is trying to find a solution, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's using sex as leverage without mutual agreement, that's a problem. The post shows he's aware it might be selfish but feels it's necessary. The community might weigh the health risks against the relationship dynamics. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to address a real concern without forcing her to use protection, but needs better communication. However, some might argue A if they see it as using sex as a weapon. But given the context, B seems more likely.\n"
