I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been in a relationship for over a year. They're both 20 and living with their parents. They haven't used any protection except the pull-out method. The author has tried to insist on using condoms before because he's worried about the risk of pregnancy and isn't ready for kids financially or emotionally. The girlfriend doesn't want to, saying that she's never used condoms in her past, hasn't gotten pregnant, and doesn't like how they feel. She argues that the pull-out method is enough, and the author feels she's being irrational.\n\nNow, the author is considering reducing their sex until they find a middle ground. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing that. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: he's concerned about unintended pregnancy and the risks involved. He's young, not in a position to handle parenthood, and the girlfriend isn't using any other birth control methods. He's trying to protect both of them. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is resistant to using condoms because of preference and past experience. She might feel that the author is being controlling or not trusting her decision-making.\n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both partners should ideally agree on the level of risk they're comfortable with. The author is trying to negotiate for his comfort level, but the girlfriend isn't budging. If the author feels that continuing without protection is too high a risk for him, does he have a right to ask for changes? However, reducing sex without a mutual agreement might be seen as a withholding of intimacy, which could be seen as a power play or not respecting her boundaries.\n\nBut then again, if the author is uncomfortable with the current arrangement, he's within his rights to seek a compromise. The problem is that the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise. The author could be in the right if he's trying to protect himself and his future. But if he unilaterally reduces sex without discussing and finding a middle ground, that might be seen as inconsiderate of her feelings and their relationship dynamics.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author has tried to bring it up, and they've had arguments. If he's trying to reduce sex to find a middle ground, maybe he needs to approach it differently, perhaps by seeking counseling together or discussing other forms of birth control that they can agree on. But as the question stands, the author is considering reducing sex unilaterally. That could be seen as wrong because it's making a decision that affects both without mutual consent. However, if the risk is too high for him, he might feel he has no choice but to take steps to protect himself.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's trying to reduce sex because he's not comfortable with the current risk, he's acting in his own interests, which is valid. But if he does it without mutual agreement, it might be seen as a breach of trust or not respecting her autonomy. However, since they haven't reached an agreement, he's not wrong in trying to find a solution. Maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because he's taking responsibility for his own boundaries and trying to address a valid concern. But if the question is about whether his action of reducing sex is wrong, then it's a bit of a gray area. But given the context, he's not in the wrong because he's acting to protect himself from a risk he's not willing to take.\n"
