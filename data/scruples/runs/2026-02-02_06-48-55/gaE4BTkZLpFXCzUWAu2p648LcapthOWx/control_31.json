I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend due to their lack of protection. So, first, I need to analyze the situation presented.\n\nThe couple has been together over a year, both 20 years old, living with parents, and not ready for kids. They use the pull-out method without condoms. The author tried to insist on condoms before, but the girlfriend didn't agree. Now, the author is considering reducing sex to find a middle ground. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are consent, communication, and mutual agreement in a relationship. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and has tried discussing it. The girlfriend is resistant to condoms and other methods, citing past experiences and preference. The author feels she's being irrational, but relationships require compromise from both sides.\n\nIs the author right to feel that his concerns are valid? Yes, avoiding pregnancy is a legitimate concern, especially when they're not ready for children. But how does one handle it when the partner isn't willing to compromise? The author is considering reducing sexual activity to push his partner towards a middle ground. Is that fair?\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have a say. If the author feels that the current situation is risky and he's not comfortable with it, he has the right to express that. However, reducing sex as a form of pressure could be seen as a form of coercion. It might lead to resentment or imbalance. The author should ideally find another way to communicate his needs without using this as a tactic.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's trying to protect both of them from a risky situation, maybe he's justified. However, the method he's considering\u2014reducing sex\u2014might be seen as a selfish move if it's done unilaterally without mutual agreement. The right approach would be to find a solution that both agree on, not as a punishment.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's using the reduction in sex as a way to force her to comply, that could be problematic. But if he's trying to find a compromise and this is a step towards that, maybe not. But according to relationship advice, using sex as a bargaining chip can be harmful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because he's unilaterally changing the terms without mutual agreement, even if his intentions are good. But I need to check if the options are A for yes (in the wrong) or B for no. The user's instruction says answer A or B based on that.\n"
