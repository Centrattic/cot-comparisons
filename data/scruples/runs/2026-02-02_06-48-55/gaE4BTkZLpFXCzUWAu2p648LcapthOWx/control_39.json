I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be a Jerk for Telling All) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not using protection and the author wanting to stop or reduce sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author and his girlfriend have been together over a year. They use the pull-out method, no condoms or other protection. The author has tried to insist on condoms before because they're young, living with parents, and not ready for kids. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms, saying she's never used them in the past and hasn't gotten pregnant. She prefers pull-out, doesn't like how condoms feel. They've had arguments about this. The author feels she's being irrational but isn't sure if he's being selfish by wanting to reduce sex.\n\nSo, the main issue is about safe sex and mutual agreement. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and wants protection, which is reasonable. The girlfriend is resistant, possibly due to past habits or discomfort with condoms. The author is considering reducing sex until they find a compromise.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a health and responsibility standpoint, the author is right to want protection. However, he's considering cutting down on sex, which could be seen as a form of withholding intimacy, potentially a form of punishment. But if both parties aren't in agreement on safe sex practices, is it fair for one to pressure the other?\n\nIn relationships, both partners should be on the same page regarding such important decisions. The girlfriend is not compliant with using protection, which increases the author's risk. The author is trying to find a solution but hasn't reached a compromise yet. Reducing sex to encourage a compromise might be a way to prioritize his own boundaries. However, it's important to consider communication and whether there's a middle ground. For example, maybe the girlfriend is open to other forms of contraception, but the author says she's against birth control pills and female condoms. So maybe the author is trying to enforce his will here.\n\nBut in this case, the author isn't forcing her to use condoms, he's trying to find a middle ground. The problem is that they haven't found one yet. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to reduce sex. If the girlfriend is being resistant and the author is trying to protect himself, maybe it's not wrong. However, reducing sex could be seen as a way to make her comply, which might not be fair. On the other hand, if they can't agree on safe practices, the author has the right to set boundaries.\n\nI think the key points are: the author is acting in his own best interest and the relationship's stability by wanting to prevent an unplanned pregnancy. The girlfriend isn't using protection despite his concerns, which could be a deal-breaker for him. So, if he's trying to find a middle ground and can't, reducing intimacy might be a reasonable step. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
