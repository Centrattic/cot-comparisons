I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend over the use of protection. \n\nFirst, the context: They're both 20, not in a position for kids, and they've been using the pull-out method. The guy wanted to use condoms, but she refused, arguing she's been fine before and doesn't like condoms. They've discussed other methods, but she's against them.\n\nThe author is conflicted. He feels it's irresponsible but doesn't want to be selfish by cutting down sex. The question is if he's wrong for considering this.\n\nSo, from a right/wrong standpoint, the author is trying to protect both of them from potential pregnancy. The girlfriend isn't using any protection, and he's making a reasonable effort to get her to consider safer options. He's not forcing her but trying to find a middle ground. If reducing sex is a consequence of her refusing all protection, maybe he's justified. However, he needs to approach this carefully. The key points are mutual consent and communication. If he stops or reduces sex, it's a personal choice to uphold his boundaries. But he shouldn't do it without discussing it fully. Since he's already tried to communicate and she's not budging, maybe he's in the right. However, there's a risk of using sex as a form of control, so that's a line he shouldn't cross. But his main goal is safety, not punishment. So, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with a caveat about ensuring it's not coercive.\n"
