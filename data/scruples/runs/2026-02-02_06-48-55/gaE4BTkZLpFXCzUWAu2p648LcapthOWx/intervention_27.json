I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend over the use of protection.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together over a year. The author has tried to use condoms, but the girlfriend refuses, using the pull-out method. He's concerned about unintended pregnancy and the risks, especially since they're young and not ready for kids. She argues that she's been fine before without condoms and doesn't like how they feel. The author feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFactors to consider: Communication, mutual consent, and health risks. The author is trying to protect both of them from an unwanted pregnancy. The girlfriend, however, is adamant about not using protection. The key point is whether the author's decision to reduce sex is a reasonable step given the situation.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. If one partner is uncomfortable with the risks involved, it's reasonable to adjust the sexual activity until a compromise is reached. The author isn't pressuring her to use a specific method but is trying to find a solution that works for both. However, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as a form of coercion if not discussed properly. It's important whether the author has tried all other avenues first. They mentioned talking about birth control and female condoms, which she's against. Maybe there are other options, but it's possible they've exhausted those.\n\nThe author is acting out of concern for both their well-being. It's not just about his selfishness but about shared responsibility. If the girlfriend isn't willing to use any protection, the author has the right to protect himself. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's prioritizing safety and trying to find a solution that works. However, if he's not willing to listen to her perspective and force his will, that could be problematic. But from the description, he's tried to compromise and is now considering reducing sex as a last resort, which is a reasonable step when mutual agreement can't be reached.\n"
