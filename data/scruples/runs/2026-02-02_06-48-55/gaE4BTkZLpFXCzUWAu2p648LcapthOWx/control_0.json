I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with their girlfriend due to not using protection.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together over a year, both are 20 and living with their parents. They don't use protection except the pull-out method. The guy wants to use condoms for safety, but the girl refuses, arguing that she's never used them before and hasn't gotten pregnant, doesn't like the feel, and thinks the pull-out is enough. The guy is concerned about the risk of pregnancy, especially since they can't handle it financially or emotionally. He's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). To determine this, I need to consider both sides.\n\nThe guy's perspective: He's advocating for safer sex practices because he's not ready for parenthood. He's tried discussing it but the girl isn't budging. His concern is valid, as unplanned pregnancy can have major consequences. He's trying to find a compromise but feels stuck.\n\nThe girl's perspective: She's resistant to using condoms, possibly due to past habits, comfort issues, and belief in the pull-out method. She might feel that the guy is being controlling or not trusting her. Her argument that she hasn't gotten pregnant before might be based on confidence in her method, though it's not foolproof.\n\nLegally, in many places, both partners have the right to consent to sexual activity. If one partner is uncomfortable with the current method, they can set boundaries. However, pressuring someone to stop or reduce sex could be seen as a form of controlling behavior if not communicated respectfully.\n\nEthically, the guy is trying to protect both of them from an unwanted pregnancy. But if he's reducing sex unilaterally without mutual agreement, it could be seen as withholding consent or using the relationship as leverage, which isn't healthy. However, if he's trying to negotiate and find a middle ground, that's different.\n\nPossible middle grounds include using alternative contraception methods like the pill or female condoms, which the girl is unwilling to try. If the guy is okay with the pull-out method but wants to add condoms for extra protection, but the girl refuses, then he has to decide whether to proceed without protection or reduce intimacy. \n\nThe key factors here are communication, mutual respect, and consent. If the guy is trying to communicate his needs and the girl isn't budging, it's a negotiation issue. However, reducing sex without mutual agreement could be seen as a power move, especially if it's to pressure her into using protection. But given the high stakes of unintended pregnancy, his concern is valid.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have equal say in sexual health decisions. If one partner's needs are being ignored repeatedly, it's a problem. The girl's refusal to consider alternatives might be a red flag, but the guy's response also needs to be respectful.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's trying to find a compromise and reducing sex is his way of protecting himself, maybe not. But if the reduction is a form of punishment or control, then yes. The post suggests he's trying to find a middle ground, so his intention might be to protect both of them. However, the method of reducing sex could be problematic if it's unilateral without discussion. But given the context, he's not necessarily in the wrong because he's acting in their mutual best interest regarding safety.\n"
