I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they're not using protection. They've been together over a year, both 20, and they use the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms, but the girlfriend refuses, saying she's never used them before and doesn't like the feeling. They argue about it, and the author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy without proper protection. The girlfriend is against condoms and other methods. The author feels it's irresponsible but also thinks it's selfish to impose this change. Now, is the author wrong for considering this?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author has tried discussing it before, leading to arguments. They might feel their health and future are at risk. On the other hand, the girlfriend's preferences and comfort are important too. The author wants to protect both of them, but the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise. If the author decides to limit sex, is that fair?\n\nLegally and medically, they both have the right to make decisions about their bodies. However, the author is concerned about unintended pregnancy, which is a valid health concern. The girlfriend's past luck doesn't guarantee future safety. The author isn't forcing her to have sex; he's considering adjusting their frequency to find a solution. So, is this selfish or reasonable?\n\nThe author's position is about mutual safety. If the girlfriend isn't open to any protection methods, the author has a right to set boundaries for his own safety. Reducing sex until a compromise is reached could be a responsible choice rather than being in the wrong. The girlfriend's refusal to use any method, even female condoms or birth control, might be seen as not taking the risk seriously. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect himself.\n"
