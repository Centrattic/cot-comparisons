I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a relationship with his girlfriend. They've been together over a year, and they're both 20, living with their parents, and not ready for kids. They've been using the pull-out method without condoms. He's tried to get them to use condoms, but she resists, saying she doesn't like how they feel and that she's been fine in the past. Now he's considering reducing or stopping sex until they find a middle ground. He's worried about pregnancy and feels she's being irrational. The question is whether he's in the wrong if he does that.\n\nHmm. So, I need to evaluate if his action is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's think about both sides.\n\nOn one hand, he's concerned about unintended pregnancy and the risks involved. He's not ready for kids, and it's a valid concern. The pull-out method isn't very reliable, and he's trying to protect both of them. By wanting to use condoms, he's acting responsibly. However, the problem is that his partner isn't willing to use them, and he's considering reducing sex as a way to enforce his preference. \n\nBut wait, can he unilaterally decide to stop or reduce sex? That might be a problem. In a relationship, both partners need to have a say in their sexual activities. If he stops sex because of his preference and she's not on board, does that make him in the wrong? It depends on communication and mutual agreement. He's tried discussing it, but they're at an impasse. If he decides to reduce sex to pressure her into using protection, that's essentially using sex as a bargaining chip, which isn't healthy. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent and mutual comfort. If she's not comfortable using condoms, is it fair to him to stop having sex if she's not meeting his needs? But he's also not meeting her needs by refusing to have sex without condoms. So there's a balance here. \n\nAnother angle: Is there a middle ground? He mentioned birth control pills and female condoms, but she's against those. Maybe other options like IUDs or implants exist, but he hasn't explored those. Maybe he could look into those alternatives instead of cutting down on sex. \n\nHe's feeling that she's being irrational because she dismisses his concerns. But she's also making a point about comfort and past experiences. It's possible he's not respecting her autonomy here. If he reduces sex without her consent, is that controlling? That could lead to resentment on both sides.\n\nSo, considering all this, if he decides to stop or reduce sex unilaterally, it might be seen as inconsiderate of her needs and preferences. Healthy relationships require compromise and communication. Since they haven't found a solution together, he might need to find a better way than cutting back on intimacy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's taking action without a mutual agreement.\n"
