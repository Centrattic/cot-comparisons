I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they and their girlfriend are not using protection, just the pull-out method. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and has tried to talk about using condoms before, but the girlfriend doesn't want to. She argues that she's been fine in the past, doesn't like the feel of condoms, and thinks the pull-out method is sufficient. The author feels she's being irrational but is conflicted about whether it's selfish to reduce or stop sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their responsibilities and each other's rights. Both are in a relationship and have mutual responsibilities. The author is worried about unintended pregnancy, which is a valid concern, especially since they're young and not in a financial or emotional place to handle a child. The girlfriend, on the other hand, has her own preferences and past experiences, and is resisting using condoms for reasons related to comfort and past practices.\n\nCommunication is key here. The author has tried discussing it and there's been some arguments. They mentioned bringing up alternatives like birth control pills and female condoms, which she's not keen on. The author is now considering reducing sex until they find a compromise. Is that fair?\n\nWell, the author has a right to express their needs for safe sex. The risk of pregnancy without protection is real, and the pull-out method isn't reliable. The girlfriend's refusal to use any form of protection despite the author's concerns might be seen as not respecting the author's boundaries. However, the author also needs to consider the girlfriend's comfort and preferences. Reducing sex could be seen as a way to assert their boundaries, but it's a significant step that affects the relationship dynamics.\n\nIs the author being selfish? If they're prioritizing their own safety and future, maybe not. But they have to approach it with empathy. The girlfriend's stance is also valid in that she has her own reasons and experiences. However, the author isn't wrong in wanting to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy. The question is whether reducing sex is an appropriate step. Since they haven't reached an agreement and the author feels that continuing the current arrangement is too risky, taking a break might be a reasonable way to push for a safer method. It's a form of communication, albeit a drastic one, to show the seriousness of the issue.\n\nBut is there a better way? They could seek counseling or find another middle ground. However, the author might feel that they've exhausted those options. The key is whether the author's actions are inconsiderate or if they have a legitimate reason. Since they're not forcing the girlfriend to use something she's against, but instead trying to create a compromise, it's more about protecting both parties. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in both their interests.\n"
