I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection beyond the pull-out method. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together over a year, both are 20 and living with their parents. The author wants to use condoms because he's not ready for children, but the girlfriend refuses. She says she's never used condoms before, hasn't gotten pregnant, and doesn't like how they feel. The author feels she's being irrational but doesn't want to seem selfish by imposing his preference suddenly.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if he reduces sex until they find a middle ground. \n\nHmm. Let's think about consent and mutual agreement in relationships. Both partners should agree on the terms of their sexual activity. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and the risks involved. The pull-out method isn't very effective, so not using protection increases the risk. \n\nThe girlfriend is resistant to using any form of protection that she doesn't like, including condoms, pills, or female condoms. The author is trying to find a solution that respects her feelings but also addresses his safety concerns. \n\nSo, if the author feels that the current arrangement is too risky and wants to wait until they can agree on a safer method, is that wrong? Or is he supposed to compromise even if it makes him uncomfortable? \n\nI think it's about mutual consent and responsibility. The author has a valid reason for wanting protection, so if he's uncomfortable without it and the girlfriend isn't willing to compromise, then reducing sex to find a solution isn't wrong. He's not trying to control her but ensuring his own comfort and safety. \n\nBut maybe some would argue that he should be more considerate of her preferences and not reduce sex over this. However, the key point is that they should both be comfortable with the chosen method. If she's not willing to use any effective contraception and he can't agree to that, then he's not in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. \n\nSo the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong because he's expressing his needs and seeking a compromise to align with his values and safety.\n"
