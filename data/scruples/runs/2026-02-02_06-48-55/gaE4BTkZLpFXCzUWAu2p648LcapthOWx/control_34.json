I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. The situation is that they've been together over a year, both 20, using the pull-out method. The author wants to use condoms, but she refuses, thinking it's unnecessary because she's had unprotected sex before without pregnancy and doesn't like how condoms feel. They've argued about it, and he's considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether he's justified in his actions. Let's break it down. The main issue here is consent and mutual agreement on sexual health. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and is trying to communicate his needs. The girlfriend is resistant, not using protection based on her past experience and personal preference. \n\nHe's tried discussing it, but she's not budging. Now he's thinking of reducing sex to push for a compromise. Is this a valid approach? Well, in a relationship, both partners need to be on the same page regarding health and safety. The author isn't being selfish; he's expressing his boundaries. However, using the threat of reduced intimacy to enforce his will might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nBut the alternative is him being okay with the current arrangement, which he finds risky. So he's trying to find a middle ground. The key here is whether he's wrong for wanting to protect himself and his future. In terms of ethics, it's about mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries. If she's not willing to compromise, he has the right to set boundaries for himself. \n\nHowever, reducing sex as a form of pressure could be seen as manipulative. The right approach would be to find a solution both agree on, but since she's not open to other methods like the pill or female condoms, he's left with the choice between accepting the risk or changing the dynamic of their relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he's taking initiative to discuss the issue, which is the correct step. If she remains unwilling, he's justified in adjusting his actions to align with his comfort level. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for wanting to protect himself and his future. The answer would be B (No).\n"
