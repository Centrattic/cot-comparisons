I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together over a year, both 20, living with parents. They use the pull-out method but no condoms. The author has tried to insist on condoms before, but the girlfriend doesn't like them, says she's never used them in past relationships and hasn't gotten pregnant. She argues that the pull-out is enough. The author feels she's being irrational and is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nSo, what's the key here? The main issue is consent and mutual agreement on sexual health. Both partners should have a say in their sexual activities. The author is concerned about unintended pregnancy and is pushing for protection, which is a valid health concern. However, the girlfriend is resistant and feels her way is acceptable. The author is considering reducing sex to enforce his preference, which could be seen as imposing his will on her. \n\nBut wait, is the author in the wrong for wanting to protect himself? Or is the girlfriend in the wrong for not using protection? The author isn't using coercion beyond reducing sex. However, if he's considering cutting down on sex to pressure her into using protection, that might be seen as a form of coercion. But if he's trying to find a middle ground, maybe that's reasonable. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to negotiate and find solutions that work for both. The author is taking steps to communicate and find a compromise. The girlfriend isn't open to other methods like birth control pills or female condoms, which complicates things. The author's concern is valid, but his approach might be seen as extreme if it's about reducing sex without mutual agreement. \n\nBut is reducing or stopping sex to protect himself from pregnancy a form of being in the wrong? It's a personal choice, but it's important that both partners are on board. If he can't reach an agreement, then maybe he's within his rights to prioritize his own comfort and safety, even if it affects the relationship. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for considering this. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should share. The author is trying to be responsible, while the girlfriend is dismissing his concerns. The author's action of reducing sex to avoid a scenario he's uncomfortable with isn't inherently wrong. But if it's done in a way that's controlling, that's different. The post says he's trying to find a middle ground, which suggests he's not being unreasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting in his own interest to prevent unintended pregnancy and is seeking a compromise. The girlfriend's resistance is her choice, but the author's decision to adjust their sex life to align with his boundaries isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
