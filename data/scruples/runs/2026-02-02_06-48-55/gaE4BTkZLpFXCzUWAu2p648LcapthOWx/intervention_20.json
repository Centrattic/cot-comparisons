I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who've been together over a year and are having unprotected sex with the pull-out method. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy since they're 20 and not ready for kids. The girlfriend doesn't want to use condoms, saying she's never used them in her past and doesn't like the feeling. They've had arguments about it, and the author is considering reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is worried about the risk of pregnancy and wants to use protection. The girlfriend is resistant to using condoms but also to other methods like birth control pills or female condoms. The author feels that the pull-out method isn't enough and wants a compromise. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering reducing sex until they reach an agreement. To determine this, I should think about consent and communication in relationships. Both partners should be on the same page regarding sexual health. The girlfriend is not willing to use any form of protection, which the author finds risky. However, using the pull-out method without consent from the partner to that method might be an issue. \n\nThe author is trying to find a solution but is facing resistance. If the author were to stop or reduce sex to protect both of them from an unintended pregnancy, is that justifiable? On one hand, the author is prioritizing mutual safety and their own peace of mind. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel pressured or that her preferences are being ignored. \n\nBut the key point here is that the author is not forcing the issue but trying to find a compromise. The author has already discussed the risks and the girlfriend is being resistant. If they cannot agree on a method that both are comfortable with, the author might feel that reducing sex until they can find a solution is a reasonable step to protect both their economic and emotional well-being. \n\nHowever, it's also possible that the author is being controlling by unilaterally deciding to reduce sex. In a relationship, both partners need to negotiate and find a middle ground. If the author is not willing to meet halfway and instead is using the threat of reduced intimacy as leverage, that could be problematic. But the author is stating that they tried to find a middle ground and the girlfriend is not open to any alternatives. \n\nSo, if the author is trying to protect both of them from a situation that neither is ready for (pregnancy) and the partner is not willing to budge, then the author might not be in the wrong. The author is acting in a responsible manner given their own limitations and the partner's refusal to use protection. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
