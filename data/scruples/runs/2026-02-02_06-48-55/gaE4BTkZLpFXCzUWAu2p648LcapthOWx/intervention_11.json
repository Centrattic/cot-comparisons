I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given WIBTA (Would I Be the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to stop or reduce sex with their girlfriend because they're not using protection, and she's resistant to using condoms or other methods. The author feels it's irresponsible but is conflicted about imposing their wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical and relational aspects here. The key points are consent, mutual agreement, and health/safety. In a relationship, both partners should agree on contraceptive methods. The author has tried discussing it before, and there have been arguments. The girlfriend is against using condoms, citing past experiences and preference for pull-out. The author is concerned about the risk of pregnancy and wants to enforce protection now, possibly reducing sex if they can't agree.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, neither can force the other to have sex. The author is considering reducing sex until a middle ground is found. Is that fair? If the girlfriend is unwilling to use any form of protection and the author is uncomfortable with the risk, then the author's choice to reduce intimacy might be a valid way to maintain their own boundaries. However, the author must communicate this clearly, without coercion.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they're not pressuring the girlfriend to have sex and are setting boundaries based on their own comfort, then maybe not. However, the girlfriend's autonomy is also important. If the author is using the threat of reducing sex to pressure her into using protection, that's a different issue. But based on the post, the author seems to be trying to find a compromise and is conflicted about imposing their will. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The author's actions (reducing sex) could be seen as a form of negotiation. However, if the author is using this as a tactic to force the girlfriend's hand without mutual agreement, it might be considered manipulative. But the author is also prioritizing their own safety and future, which is understandable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have the right to make their own decisions. If the girlfriend is against all forms of protection, it's her choice, but the author has the right to not engage in potentially risky behavior. So, the author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, it's possible that the author could be considered the asshole if their approach is seen as controlling or if they're not respecting the girlfriend's autonomy. But given the context, it's a complex situation where the author is taking a responsible stance and trying to communicate their concerns.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are trying to negotiate and set boundaries based on their values, which is a valid approach in a relationship. However, it's important that this is done respectfully without coercion.\n"
