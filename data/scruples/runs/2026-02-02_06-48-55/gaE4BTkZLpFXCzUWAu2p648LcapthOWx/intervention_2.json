I\u2019ve insisted we use condoms before because we are both young (20) and living with our parents and I really am not in a place to have children right now economically or emotionally. She didnt want to and after a small argument we just continued on without protection. \n\nNow, recently I have started realizing just how irresponsible/unsafe it is having sex without any protection so I brought up the topic again. This led to another mini argument. Her defense  is that she\u2019s never used condoms in her past relationship nor has she ever gotten pregnant. She says that the pull out method is enough and that she just doesn\u2019t like the way condoms feel. I usually bring up that she\u2019s right it doesn\u2019t feel as good but it\u2019s a compromise we should take and that honestly she might just have gotten lucky. She also says that there\u2019s always a chance that it can break, I say the chances are slimmer than her getting pregant without the condom and that I\u2019ll still pull out (with the condom) if it makes her feel more comfortable, she says there\u2019s no point in even using it then. She\u2019s smart and I love her but I just can help but feeling she\u2019s being irrational.\n\nI don\u2019t really know what to do, i feel like it would be selfish of me to impose a constraint like this on our sex lives out of no where but at the same time it just feels like the smart thing to do. Also we\u2019ve talked about birth control pills and female condoms, she\u2019s not up for that either.\n\nSo, WIBTA if i try to reduce our sex until I can find some sort of middle ground?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for considering reducing or stopping sex with his girlfriend because they aren't using protection. The author tried to use condoms before, but the girlfriend didn't want to. Now he's thinking about reducing sex until they find a middle ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about unplanned pregnancy and not in a position for children. He's trying to compromise by suggesting condoms, but she's resistant. She's been in a past relationship without protection and hasn't gotten pregnant, so she might feel it's low risk. But the author is worried about the luck factor.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to change their sexual activity. On one hand, he's trying to protect himself from a situation he's not ready for. On the other, reducing or stopping sex could be seen as imposing his will without mutual agreement. The girlfriend might feel pressured, especially if she's not willing to use other methods. They need to find a solution both agree on, but if they can't, the author's choice to adjust their sex life might be justified for his own comfort and safety.\n\nBut does that make him in the wrong? If he's being honest about his concerns and trying to find a middle ground, maybe not. However, if he's using this as a way to control the relationship without addressing her feelings, then maybe he is. The key is whether he's being selfish or standing up for his needs. Since both have different views on protection, it's a mutual decision. The author's action might be seen as responsible from his end, but the girlfriend might see it as a loss of intimacy. It's a tough balance. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because he's protecting his own interests, but the situation is complex. The answer is B (No).\n"
