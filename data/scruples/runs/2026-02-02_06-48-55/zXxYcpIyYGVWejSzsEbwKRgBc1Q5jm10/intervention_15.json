Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples, even younger ones, are allowed. The author is upset and decides not to go to the campout, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 26, in a one-year relationship, and the girlfriend's family separated them, thinking it's inappropriate. The author felt this was unfair, especially since other couples were allowed to share tents. He communicated his frustration, and the girlfriend agreed the next year would be different, but the family changed their mind again. The author then refuses to go, leading to the girlfriend being upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The family's decision might be based on their values or cultural norms, maybe to avoid setting a bad example for kids. The author's reaction is understandable; he feels singled out and insulted. However, he chose to not attend the event, which upset his girlfriend. \n\nIs it reasonable for the family to have their own rules? Maybe, but the inconsistency (other couples allowed) is a problem. The author's girlfriend tried to mediate, but the author is now holding out. Is it fair for him to refuse to attend an event that's important to his girlfriend's family? The girlfriend is upset because he's prioritizing his feelings over her family's event. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid. Being treated differently when others aren't could lead to resentment. However, walking away entirely might be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's wishes or her family's dynamics. The girlfriend might feel the author is being selfish or not compromising. \n\nThe girlfriend initially agreed with him but then the family changed their decision. The author might feel that the family isn't respecting their relationship, but his refusal to attend could be seen as a conflict-avoidance tactic. It's a balance between respecting family traditions and personal boundaries. \n\nIn AITA posts, often the wrong is on the person making the other person uncomfortable without considering their feelings. Here, the author's refusal might be impacting his girlfriend's family relationships. But he also has a right to feel respected. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is overreacting or standing up for himself. If the family's rules are inconsistent and hypocritical, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, choosing not to attend a family event because of this might be seen as not supporting his girlfriend's family, which could be a point against him. But the family's inconsistency complicates that. \n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The family's rules are arbitrary, and the author has a right to feel upset. However, the decision to not go might have been a mistake, but it's not necessarily him being the asshole. So answer B.\n"
