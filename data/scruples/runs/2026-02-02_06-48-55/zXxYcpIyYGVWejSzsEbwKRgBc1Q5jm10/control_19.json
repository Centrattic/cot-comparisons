Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other younger couples are allowed. The author feels it's unfair and decides not to go, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The girlfriend's family set the rules, thinking it's inappropriate. They might prioritize modesty or setting an example for kids, common in some family settings. The author, on the other hand, feels singled out and offended. He's an adult, in a committed relationship, and it's affecting his enjoyment. \n\nThe girlfriend tried to promise that next year they'd share a tent, but the family didn't follow through. The author then decides not to attend, which his girlfriend is upset about. The key points here are consent, respect for family rules vs. personal comfort, and communication.\n\nIs the author wrong for not attending? Well, he's within his rights to prioritize his comfort. But maybe the way he communicated his refusal was harsh. However, the family's rules are problematic because they apply only to him and his girlfriend. The girlfriend's family's inconsistency (allowing other couples) adds to the unfairness.\n\nThe girlfriend's frustration might stem from feeling torn between her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. The author not attending could be seen as standing up for his boundaries. But maybe he should have tried to find another solution instead of refusing outright. However, given the circumstances, his reaction is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's rules are the root of the conflict. Answer B.\n"
