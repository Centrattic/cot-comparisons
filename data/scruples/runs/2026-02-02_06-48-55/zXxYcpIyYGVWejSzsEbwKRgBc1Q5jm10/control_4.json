Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not being allowed to share a tent with his girlfriend during a family campout. The family thinks it's inappropriate, but other younger couples are allowed to share tents. The author is upset, feels it's unfair, and decides not to go this year, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The family's stance might be based on their values or trying to set an example for kids. The author and his girlfriend are in a committed relationship, older, and have been together longer than other couples who are allowed to share tents. The author's frustration is understandable because it seems inconsistent and unfair. The girlfriend agreed with him last year but her family still said no this year. The author's decision to not attend might be seen as holding a grudge or not respecting the family's rules, but it's also about feeling disrespected.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The key points are the fairness of the family's decision and the author's response. The family's rules apply unevenly, which could justify the author's anger. However, the author is choosing not to attend a family event, which could hurt feelings. But given the situation, his reaction might be reasonable. The girlfriend's family might be out of line, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
