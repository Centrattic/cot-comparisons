Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the setup is that the author's girlfriend's family doesn't allow them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other younger couples do. The author is upset about being treated differently and decides not to go, causing conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The family's reasoning seems to be about setting a good example for the kids. But the author points out that other couples, who are younger and less established, are allowed to share tents. That inconsistency is a problem. The author's frustration is understandable because they feel singled out. \n\nThe girlfriend initially promised that next year they could share a tent, but when the author's girlfriend's family backtracked, the author refused to attend. The girlfriend is upset because he's not going and didn't talk to her parents. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the family's rules might be based on outdated or conservative views, but they're the ones enforcing it. The author isn't wrong for being upset because the rule is applied unevenly. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending and not talking to the parents. \n\nThe author tried to address the issue, but his girlfriend refused his help. The decision not to attend might be seen as a personal choice, especially given the family's stance. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the fact that other couples aren't under the same restrictions makes the author's position stronger. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the family's policies are problematic, and the author isn't in the wrong for holding his ground. The girlfriend's insistence to go despite the author's discomfort could be an issue too. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
