Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a family campout where the girlfriend's family won't let the author share a tent with his girlfriend, even though other couples do. The author feels insulted and decides not to go, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that it's unfair\u2014since they're a committed couple and others are allowed to share tents. He feels singled out, which is frustrating. He tried to handle it by discussing with his girlfriend and even offered to talk to her parents directly, but she stopped him. His refusal to attend the campout is a result of feeling disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, like maintaining family dynamics, setting an example for kids, or cultural norms. The girlfriend might be respecting her family's wishes, even if she agrees with the author's perspective. Her insistence that he go might be to avoid conflict with her parents, which is a valid family dynamic.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the family's rules are non-negotiable and he's choosing not to attend because of it, is that his fault? Or is the family's policy the problem? The author's actions stem from feeling treated unfairly. However, his decision to not attend might be seen as a personal choice rather than being in the wrong. But since the girlfriend is upset, there's a relationship strain. \n\nThe key points are consent and communication. The author expressed his feelings and tried to resolve it. The family's policy remains, leading to his decision. He's not violating any rules; he's prioritizing his comfort. However, in a relationship, sometimes compromising is necessary. If the girlfriend values family time and the author's refusal causes her distress, maybe he should reconsider. But is that his fault?\n\nAlternatively, if the family's stance is unreasonable, the author's refusal is justified. The girlfriend's family's double standard (other couples allowed) adds to the unfairness. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The problem lies with the family's policy and the girlfriend's handling of it. The author's anger is a reaction to perceived unfair treatment. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
