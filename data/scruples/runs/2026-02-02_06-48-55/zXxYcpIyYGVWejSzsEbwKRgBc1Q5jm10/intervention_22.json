Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples are. The author feels insulted and refuses to go next year, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend's family has this rule, possibly due to cultural or family norms. The author is upset because they're being treated differently, especially when other couples aren't. They tried to talk to the family, but the girlfriend wouldn't let the author speak to them directly. The author then decides not to go, causing the girlfriend to be upset.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, they feel disrespected and singled out. It's understandable to be frustrated if you're treated differently from others in a similar situation. But is that a valid reason to refuse to attend an event, especially if it's a family tradition? The girlfriend might feel that the author is overreacting or not respecting her family's wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family's stance might be based on their own values. They might have strict rules about what's appropriate, even for adults. The author could argue that their relationship is more mature and they should be allowed to share a tent. However, the girlfriend might be caught between her partner and her family, trying to mediate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The author's actions (refusing to go) might be seen as not respecting the family's wishes and the girlfriend's efforts to navigate the situation. But if the author genuinely feels insulted and the family isn't compromising, maybe it's a mutual misunderstanding. The author might not be in the wrong if the family is being unreasonable, but if they're not considering the family's perspective, maybe they are.\n\nI need to think about the balance here. The author has a right to feel respected. However, refusing to attend could be seen as a selfish decision that affects the girlfriend's family relationships. The girlfriend is caught in the middle, so the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their reaction could be excessive. Alternatively, the family's rules might be outdated, so the author's stance is valid.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if the family's rules are unreasonable. But if the author's refusal is causing unnecessary conflict and not considering the girlfriend's position, they might be. However, given the situation where they're treated differently despite being in a more stable relationship, the author has a point. So maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
