Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend are not allowed to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples there are allowed to. The author is upset because they've been together a long time, and others who are younger and in shorter relationships are allowed to share tents. He ends up not going because he's not okay with being separated again, and the girlfriend is upset with him for not going and not talking to her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The family's decision to separate them. The author's frustration because it's inconsistent with how other couples are treated. The girlfriend agreed with him but then didn't want him to confront her parents. The author's refusal to attend the campout again because of this.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being treated unfairly compared to others. He's willing to compromise by not talking to her parents himself but the girlfriend insists on not doing that. The family's reasoning is about setting an example for the kids, but maybe they see the author as an outsider and are trying to maintain a certain image in front of their family.\n\nOn the other hand, the family's rules might be based on their values. The girlfriend might be caught between her partner's feelings and her family's expectations. She agreed with the author initially but then didn't push her parents, which could be a point of conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong for not going? Well, he's standing up for his own comfort and feelings. If the family is being inconsistent, maybe he has a right to be upset. But maybe he overstepped by not going and not respecting his girlfriend's wishes to attend. The girlfriend might feel that the campout is important, and his refusal to attend caused her distress.\n\nAlternatively, the author could have tried to find another solution, like setting boundaries or finding a separate spot. But given the context, the family's rules are causing conflict. It's a matter of balancing personal boundaries with family expectations. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong because the family's rules are discriminatory and inconsistent. However, his refusal to attend might have been a harsh response. The girlfriend's frustration comes from the author not engaging with her parents as she wanted, which complicates things. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the family's actions were unfair, and he's justified in his reaction. But I need to be careful here. If the girlfriend was okay with the situation, maybe the author shouldn't have made a big deal, but she agreed with him. Hmm. I think B is the better answer.\n"
