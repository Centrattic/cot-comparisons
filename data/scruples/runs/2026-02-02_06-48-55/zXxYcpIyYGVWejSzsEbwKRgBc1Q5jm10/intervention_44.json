Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The guy is upset because his girlfriend's family made them sleep separately at a family campout. He's frustrated because other couples, even younger ones, were allowed to share tents, but they weren't. He feels it's unfair and personal. The girlfriend's family said they needed to talk to other adults, and then decided they have to be separate again. The guy refuses to go this year, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the family's decision might be based on their own comfort or cultural norms. They might not think it's appropriate for their daughter to share a tent with her partner in front of other relatives, especially with kids present. It's possible they don't want to set a precedent or feel it's too early in the relationship (though they've been dating a year). The guy might not see the issue from their perspective.\n\nThen there's the issue of other couples. If other couples were allowed to share tents, maybe the family made an exception for them. But maybe those couples aren't as close to the family's kids or the family has different standards for their own. The guy might feel it's discriminatory, but the family could have their reasons.\n\nThe guy's reaction is to refuse to attend if they can't share a tent. That's a big decision because it affects the girlfriend's family event. His girlfriend agreed with him last year but now the family's stance hasn't changed. The guy is putting pressure on her to get her parents to change their mind, and when she can't, he pulls out. That could be seen as him not respecting her family's wishes or their traditions. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It depends on whose perspective you take. He's standing up for his own needs and feelings, which is valid. But he might not be considering the family's perspective. However, if the family is being inconsistent (other couples are allowed), maybe his frustration is justified. But by refusing to go altogether, he's making a big deal out of it, which might not be fair if the family is just uncomfortable. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because he's not respecting her family's wishes. He's prioritizing his own comfort over attending an event important to her family. So, maybe he's in the wrong for not compromising. Or he's justified if the family is being unreasonable. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards him being in the right because the family's rules seem inconsistent. But if the family has their own reasons, he might need to find a middle ground instead of cutting off the event entirely. Hmm, tricky.\n"
