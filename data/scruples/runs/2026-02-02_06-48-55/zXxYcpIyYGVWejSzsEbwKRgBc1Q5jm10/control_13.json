Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the couple can share a tent at a family campout. The author's girlfriend's family said they can't share a tent because of setting a bad example for the kids, even though other couples who are younger and less established are allowed to. The author is upset about this, feels singled out, and decides not to go this year. His girlfriend is upset with him for not going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The family's perspective might be about their values and trying to protect their kids. They might feel uncomfortable with adult couples sharing a tent in front of children, even if the couple is in a committed relationship. On the other hand, the author and his girlfriend are adults, have been dating a year, and the other couples are allowed to share tents. It does seem a bit hypocritical from the family's side.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. Being the only couple treated differently must feel like a personal slight. His girlfriend initially agreed that next year they'd share a tent, but the family changed their mind. The author then decides not to attend, which upsets his girlfriend. \n\nIs the author wrong to prioritize his comfort and the family's inconsistency over attending the event? Or is he justified in standing up for himself? Relationships require compromise, but so do respecting each other's boundaries. The family's decision might be based on their values, but they should also consider the couple's feelings. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not attending if he feels disrespected. However, maybe he could have found a middle ground, like talking to the family himself, which he was allowed to do but chose not to. His girlfriend wanted him to go, so his refusal might have hurt her. But the family's stance seems inconsistent, which complicates things.\n\nI think the main issue is the family's double standard. Other couples are allowed to share tents, so it's unfair to the author's couple. The author isn't the asshole for being upset, but maybe he handled it by not attending, which might be a valid choice. His girlfriend's reaction could be because she's caught between her family and her partner. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
