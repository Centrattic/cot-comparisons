Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other younger couples are allowed. The author is upset and decides not to go, making his girlfriend angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's family has their reasons, maybe based on their values or wanting to set an example for kids. The author feels it's unfair because they're older and in a committed relationship. He's frustrated that other couples aren't given the same restrictions. \n\nHe tried to talk to his girlfriend, who agreed they should share a tent next year. But when the time came, the parents still said no. The author then refuses to go, which upsets his girlfriend. The key points here are about respect for family boundaries versus personal feelings of fairness. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not attending? Well, he's standing up for his own comfort and feelings, which is valid. But maybe he overreacted by refusing to go without trying to resolve it with the family first. However, the girlfriend's family is also being inconsistent by allowing other couples to share. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the author is making a big deal out of something, especially if family is important to her. But the author has a right to be uncomfortable with the situation. It's a bit of a conflict between personal autonomy and family expectations. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to attend if he's not comfortable. However, maybe he should have tried to communicate better with the family before deciding not to go. But given the inconsistency in the rules (other couples sharing tents), his frustration is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family's stance might be their own, regardless of other couples. The author might have a point about the inconsistency, but he also needs to consider that the family's rules are their choice. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think not. He's expressing his feelings and setting boundaries. The problem might be that he didn't try to talk to the family directly, but the girlfriend refused to let him. So maybe he's not entirely wrong. The answer is probably B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
