Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the girlfriend's family doesn't let them share a tent during a family campout. The author is frustrated because they're both 26, have been dating a year, and other younger couples are allowed to share tents. The family only targets them, which makes him upset. He ends up not wanting to go to the campout the next year, and the girlfriend is upset with him for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's argument is that the family's rules are unfair and hypocritical because other couples aren't subject to the same restrictions. He feels personally insulted and is willing to skip the event over it. On the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, maybe cultural or conservative views, about appropriate behavior around children or family norms. The girlfriend seems to support the author's feelings but her family's decision is final, and she insists he should go despite his objections.\n\nIs the author wrong for refusing to attend? Well, relationships require compromise. If the family is important to the girlfriend, maybe the author should try to respect their wishes for her sake. But then again, his feelings are valid. He's being treated differently without a clear reason. The key here is whether his reaction is justified. Since the family's rules apply only to him and his girlfriend, and other couples aren't restricted, it does seem unfair. The author is standing up for his right to share a tent with his partner, which is a reasonable request. The girlfriend's family's stance might be outdated or inconsistent, but that's their choice.\n\nHowever, by refusing to attend, he might be prioritizing his discomfort over the girlfriend's desire to include his participation in her family event. The girlfriend is upset because she wants him to go, even if the arrangement isn't ideal. The question is whether his refusal is a disproportionate response. Given the hypocrisy of the family's rules, maybe not. The author isn't in the wrong if he feels his rights as a couple are being disrespected. But maybe he could have found a middle ground, like discussing it more with the girlfriend instead of completely bailing. Still, the core issue is the unfair treatment, so the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
