Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to attend a family campout because their girlfriend's family didn't allow them to share a tent. The girlfriend's family is enforcing this rule even though other couples there are allowed to share tents.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They feel it's unfair, especially since other couples who are younger and have been dating less time are allowed to share tents. They tried to handle it by not talking to the in-laws directly, as the girlfriend wanted to manage it. When the in-laws said they needed to discuss with other adults and then reaffirmed the rule, the author decided not to go. The girlfriend got upset because they refused to attend and didn't want the author to talk to her parents directly.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author's main issue is the perceived double standard. The family's rule seems inconsistent if others are allowed to share. The author's refusal to attend because of this policy could be seen as a valid reaction, especially since the girlfriend had previously agreed that they should share a tent next year. However, the girlfriend now disagrees, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are standing up for their boundaries and feeling disrespected by the family's rule. But they didn't communicate effectively with their girlfriend about the importance of attending versus their concerns. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing their own feelings over her family's event, especially since she wanted to attend and didn't want him to confront her parents directly. \n\nHowever, the family's rule is part of the problem here. If the rule is indeed inconsistent (other couples share but they don't), the author has a valid grievance. The key is whether the author's refusal is reasonable given the situation. Since the original agreement was that next year they would share a tent, and the in-laws reversed that decision without a clear reason, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut maybe the author should have tried to resolve the issue with the in-laws as the girlfriend suggested, even if they were uncomfortable. However, the girlfriend didn't support that. The author's actions might be justified if they feel the situation is demeaning and inconsistent. It's a tough call, but the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The family's inconsistency is problematic, and the author's refusal could be a rational response to being treated unfairly.\n"
