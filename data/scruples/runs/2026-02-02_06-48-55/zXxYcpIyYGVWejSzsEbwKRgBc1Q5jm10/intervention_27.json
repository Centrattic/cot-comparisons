Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's family doesn't let the couple share a tent at the family campout. The author is 26, in a year-long relationship, and finds this rule stupid. They agree to go along with it last year because the girlfriend promises next time they can share. But then other couples who are younger and less established start sharing tents freely, which frustrates the author. He holds it in but after the event, tells the girlfriend it ruined the trip and that if they can't share next year, he won't go. The girlfriend agrees they should share next year.\n\nThe next year, they try again. The author pushes the girlfriend to talk to her parents, but she doesn't want him to approach them. The parents then say they need to discuss with other adults and come back saying they have to stay separate. The author refuses to go, leading to a conflict with the girlfriend who is upset.\n\nHmm. So the author's main issue is feeling singled out and not being allowed to share a tent when others are. He feels it's unfair and that his relationship isn't respected. But he's choosing not to attend the family event over this, which the girlfriend is upset about.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, maybe the family has their own rules and traditions. The girlfriend might have communicated the expectation that they would share, but the parents changed their mind. The author's reaction is to not go, which could be seen as holding a grudge or not compromising. On the other hand, the family's rules seem inconsistent, and the author is justified in feeling upset about being treated differently. However, by refusing to attend, he's creating tension in the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend is in the middle, trying to mediate between her family's wishes and her partner's feelings. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" entirely because the situation is unfair. But his response (not attending) could be seen as extreme. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the author isn't the asshole here because the family's inconsistency is an issue. But he could have tried to find another way to handle it without withdrawing entirely. However, if he's standing up for his relationship's needs, that's understandable. I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the family's rules are inconsistent and the author's reaction is a form of self-respect, but it's close.\n"
