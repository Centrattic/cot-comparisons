Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a couple attending a family campout where they aren't allowed to share a tent, despite other couples being allowed. The author is upset and decides not to go next year, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend's family enforces a rule that the author and his girlfriend can't share a tent, even though other couples, some younger and less established, do so without issue. The author feels this is unfair and that his girlfriend's family is setting a bad example. He's frustrated and decides not to attend, which upsets his girlfriend. She had promised they'd share a tent next year, but the family changed their mind after discussion.\n\nThe author's main points are about feeling singled out and being insulted by the family's rules. He argues that other couples are treated differently, which seems hypocritical. His decision to not attend is based on his frustration and feeling disrespected. However, his girlfriend is upset because he's not going and wouldn't talk to her parents directly, which she didn't want him to do.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. He was following through on his own stated boundaries. If the family's rules conflict with his comfort and he's not willing to compromise, maybe that's reasonable. On the other hand, he's avoiding the event entirely, which might be seen as a big reaction. But given the repeated assurances from the girlfriend that they'd share a tent next year, which didn't happen, maybe his frustration is justified. The girlfriend's family's inconsistency in applying the rules (other couples are allowed to share) adds to the issue. \n\nThe author isn't violating any rules; he's asserting his own boundaries. The girlfriend's family's rules are the root of the problem. However, the author's decision to not attend might be seen as selfish if the girlfriend values the family event. But if the event is causing him significant distress and the family isn't willing to accommodate their relationship, his choice to prioritize his own comfort could be reasonable. \n\nThe key is whether the author's reaction is disproportionate. He's been patient for a year, tried to talk to the family, but the issue wasn't resolved. The inconsistency in the family's enforcement of the rule is a major point. The author's main conflict is with the family's policies, not the girlfriend directly. The girlfriend's upset might stem from the author not talking to her parents directly, but she had previously agreed that they should share a tent. The family's change of heart could be a point of contention as well.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's acting based on the family's failure to follow through. However, the way he's handling it\u2014threatening not to attend and not communicating directly\u2014might be seen as part of the problem. But given the girlfriend's refusal to let him talk to her parents, maybe his hands are tied. \n\nOverall, the family's rules are the initial issue, but the author's decision to not attend is a personal choice based on his boundaries. So maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The girlfriend is upset because he's not going, but if the event is causing him stress, then his choice is valid. The family's inconsistency is a bigger issue here. So the author isn't the asshole; the family's policies are unfair, and he's reacting to that.\n"
