Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a couple where the girlfriend's family refuses to let them share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples (some younger and less established) are allowed to. The author feels this is unfair and decides not to attend, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that it's hypocritical since other couples are allowed to share tents, and he feels personally insulted. He tried to talk to the girlfriend's parents but was blocked by his girlfriend. His refusal to go causes conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, possibly cultural or personal beliefs about modesty, especially with children present. The girlfriend agreed with the author's grievance but might have had her own reasons for not confronting her family. Her insistence that the author go despite his objections could indicate she values family time over his discomfort.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are: Is the author's reaction reasonable? Did he handle it appropriately? The author's refusal to attend without addressing the issue directly with the family might be seen as a legitimate stand, but his girlfriend's reaction suggests he overstepped. However, the family's double standard is questionable. The author's actions might be justified if the family's stance is indeed unfair, but his choice to walk away without resolving it through communication (as he was allowed to talk to them, but the girlfriend blocked him) could be a flaw.\n\nAlternatively, the author has a right to feel respected and the family's rules might be unreasonable. However, the girlfriend's role in this is important. She agreed with his feelings but didn't support his decision, leading to conflict. The author's refusal to attend might be a personal choice to avoid an uncomfortable situation, which isn't necessarily wrong. But the girlfriend's upset indicates it's causing strain, so maybe the author should have found a middle ground.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, different families have different rules. The author's frustration is valid, but his decision to not attend might be seen as taking a side against the girlfriend's family, which could isolate the girlfriend. However, if the family's stance is discriminatory without good reason, the author isn't entirely wrong. It's a balance between respecting family traditions and personal boundaries.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't entirely clear-cut. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that he's standing up for his beliefs in a situation where the family's rules seem inconsistent, I might lean towards him not being in the wrong. However, his approach could have been better. But the options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Given the family's inconsistency and the author's legitimate grievance, B might be the answer. But I need to make sure. Another angle: the author's girlfriend agreed with his viewpoint but still wanted him to attend, so he's choosing his comfort over her wishes. That could make him wrong. Hmm. This is tricky. The initial thought is that the author has a valid point, but his actions caused conflict with his girlfriend. So, maybe he's not in the wrong, but the situation is complex. Answer B.\n"
