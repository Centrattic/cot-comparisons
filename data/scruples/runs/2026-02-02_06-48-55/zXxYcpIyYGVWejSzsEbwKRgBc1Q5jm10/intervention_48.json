Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe author is in a relationship with a girlfriend whose family doesn't allow them to share a tent during a family campout. They tried to get the family to allow it, but after some back and forth, the family still refused. The author is upset because they feel singled out, especially since other younger couples are allowed to share tents. The girlfriend's family made a promise that next year they could share a tent, but when the time came, they changed their mind. The author decided not to go to the campout, which upset the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an outsider in the girlfriend's family. The family has their own rules and traditions. The author's main issue is about being treated differently compared to others. But maybe they didn't consider the family's perspective. The girlfriend's family might have their reasons, like maintaining certain boundaries for the kids or following traditional values.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable, but is it justified? They were promised that next year they would share a tent, but the family backed out. The author's decision to not attend is a personal choice. However, the girlfriend is upset because they didn't want the author to confront her parents. The author's refusal to go might have caused strain on the relationship. \n\nIs the author wrong for not attending? Well, they had a valid reason to feel offended. But maybe they should have handled it differently, like communicating better with the girlfriend or finding another way to resolve it without pulling out. However, the girlfriend's family's inconsistency (allowing other couples but not them) does seem unfair. The author is standing up for their boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is part of the girlfriend's family event now. Maybe they should have discussed this more privately with the girlfriend before making a decision that affects her. The girlfriend's frustration comes from the author not following through with the plan to attend, which might have been important to her family and her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think it's a bit of both. The author has a right to feel upset, but perhaps their approach could have been better. However, given the family's unfair treatment, the author's decision isn't entirely wrong. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the family's actions were inconsistent, and the author is asserting their comfort and boundaries. The girlfriend might need to mediate better between her family's traditions and her partner's needs.\n"
