Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The story is about a couple where the girlfriend's family doesn't let them share a tent at a family campout. The author, the guy, is frustrated because other couples who are younger and less established are allowed to share tents, but they aren't. The girlfriend initially agrees that next year they can share, but the family again insists they don't. The guy refuses to attend, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is upset about being treated differently, especially when others aren't. He feels insulted and doesn't want to comply anymore. The girlfriend's family is enforcing some kind of rule, possibly based on their own values or to avoid setting an example for kids. The girlfriend is caught in the middle, trying to mediate but maybe not wanting to confront her family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's actions: he's angry, refuses to attend, and is confrontational about talking to her parents. But he's also standing up for his relationship's comfort and autonomy. The girlfriend's family's stance might be based on their values, but it's causing conflict. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for refusing to attend? Well, he's within his rights to prioritize his comfort and the relationship's needs. However, maybe he could have handled it differently, like finding a compromise or discussing it more with his girlfriend. But the fact that others are allowed to share tents while they aren't might justify his frustration. The family's inconsistency could be an issue here. \n\nThe girlfriend seems to agree with his feelings but then her family still enforces the rule. The author's refusal to attend might be seen as a way to assert their autonomy, which is valid. However, maybe he didn't consider other solutions, like sleeping outside the campsite or using a different tent. But the story doesn't mention that. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014being very upset\u2014might indicate that the author's approach was too confrontational. However, the core issue is the family's rule, not his reaction. So, in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily at fault. He's standing up for his relationship's boundaries. The family is being inconsistent and imposing their rules without considering the couple's maturity. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The family's behavior is the main issue here, not the author's refusal to comply with an unjust rule.\n"
