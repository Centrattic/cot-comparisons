Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing the couple to share a tent at a family campout, while other younger couples do. The author is upset and refuses to go unless they can share a tent, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The family's stance might be based on traditions, cultural norms, or their own values. The parents might be trying to maintain boundaries, especially if there are kids around. The author, on the other hand, feels this is unfair, especially since other couples are allowed to do it. He's frustrated and sees it as a personal slight. His girlfriend supported his position but then didn't follow through when it came to talking to her parents again.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's making a decision not to attend an event that's important to his girlfriend's family, which could be seen as disrespectful. Even though the family's rules seem inconsistent, he's choosing to not participate rather than finding a compromise. His girlfriend is upset because he's not attending and he's pressuring her to fight her family. Maybe he didn't handle it well. But then again, the family's rules are arbitrary, and he's justified in feeling disrespected. \n\nThe key points are about respecting family traditions vs. personal autonomy. If the author is causing a rift in the relationship over this, maybe he's overreacting. But if the family's rules are hypocritical, then his frustration is valid. However, walking away from the event might be too drastic. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it differently. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
