Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples who are younger and less established are sharing tents. The author is upset, feels insulted, and decides not to go to the campout again, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that the family's rule is unfair because they're an established couple and others aren't being held to the same standard. He's frustrated and wants to stand up for himself. On the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, like maintaining family traditions or setting an example for kids, even if the application seems inconsistent. The girlfriend might be trying to maintain family relations and avoid conflict, hence her insistence on going despite the tent issue.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and respect. The author's refusal to attend the event because of the tent rule could be seen as a boundary issue. He's choosing not to attend to protest a policy that he finds unfair. However, relationships require compromise. If the family's rules are non-negotiable, the author might need to find a middle ground instead of completely withdrawing. \n\nBut wait, the author isn't just disagreeing; he's making a choice that affects both him and his girlfriend. His girlfriend is upset because she wants to attend and has agreed with him that the tent issue was a problem but still wants to participate. By not attending, he's prioritizing his own comfort over her desire to be with her family, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, the author's approach to resolving the issue by threatening not to attend might be seen as ultimatum-like, which isn't the healthiest way to handle disagreements. However, the family's inconsistency in applying rules (other couples sharing tents) adds complexity. The author has a valid point about the inconsistency, but his response might be overly harsh.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's frustration is understandable, but his decision to not attend could be seen as holding his girlfriend's family accountable for their inconsistency. However, the girlfriend's perspective is also important\u2014she might value family time and is trying to balance both sides. The author's actions might be seen as not respecting her wishes to maintain family relationships, which could make him the asshole in the situation. \n\nBut then again, if the policy is unfair and the author has a right to his boundaries, he's justified in not attending. It's a balance between personal boundaries and respecting others' family dynamics. The answer hinges on whether the author is overreacting or standing up for his own needs. Given that the family's rules are applied inconsistently, the author's anger is valid, but his response might be too extreme. However, the girlfriend's side is also valid, wanting to maintain family ties. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not entirely in the wrong because the family's rules are unfair. But his choice to not attend might be a selfish response to a legitimate issue, which could be seen as wrong if it causes unnecessary conflict. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for himself against an unfair policy. But if the focus is on respecting his girlfriend's family and her wishes, then A (in the wrong). However, the initial question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the family's rules are inconsistent, his response is more about his right to be treated fairly, so B might be the better answer.\n"
