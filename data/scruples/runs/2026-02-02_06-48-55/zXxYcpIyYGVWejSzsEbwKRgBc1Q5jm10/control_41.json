Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other younger couples can. The author is upset and decides not to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's family has this annual event. Last year, they weren't allowed to share a tent because of the kids, even though they're both adults. The author went along, but was annoyed. Then, this year, other younger couples arrived and shared tents without issue. The author is furious about being treated differently. He communicates his feelings, and the girlfriend agrees next year they'll share a tent. But when they try to discuss it again, the family says no again, and the author decides not to go, leading to the girlfriend being upset.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, from a moral standpoint, does the author have a valid reason to be upset, or is overreacting?\n\nThe author's perspective: They're an adult in a committed relationship, and being forced to sleep separately while others aren't feels unfair. The girlfriend's family is imposing their standards, which might be more conservative. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since they're trying to respect the family's wishes but are being treated inconsistently. The other couples aren't facing the same rules, so the author feels singled out. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective: She might be trying to maintain family harmony and respect her parents' wishes. She agreed with the author's feelings but couldn't get her family to change their decision. She's upset when the author decides not to attend, maybe because she values family time and wants to keep the peace.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's decision not to go is a personal choice. They have the right to feel uncomfortable with the family's rules, especially when others aren't held to the same standard. However, maybe they could have handled it differently, like talking to the family themselves as they offered. But the girlfriend refused. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction is justified. Since they're adults and the family's rules are inconsistent, their frustration is valid. The fact that other couples aren't facing the same restrictions makes it seem like the family is applying double standards. The author isn't doing anything wrong by standing up for their boundaries. Not attending is a reasonable response if the conditions are unacceptable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
