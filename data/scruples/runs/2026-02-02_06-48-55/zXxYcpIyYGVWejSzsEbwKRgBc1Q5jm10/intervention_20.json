Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples there, some younger and less established, are allowed to. The author feels this is unfair and decides not to attend the next year, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The family's rules might be based on their conservative views, perhaps trying to set a good example for kids. The girlfriend initially agreed with the author's perspective but then her family overruled it again. The author felt it was unfair, especially when other couples weren't subjected to the same rules. His frustration seems justified given the inconsistency.\n\nBut then, he decides not to go to the campout, which is a significant decision affecting the girlfriend's family event. The girlfriend is upset because he's refusing to attend. Here, the question is about the fairness of his actions. Is he being reasonable in his anger and decision to not attend? Or is he overreacting and not considering the family dynamics?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel respected and not singled out. The family's rules seem inconsistent. On the other hand, his response is to withdraw from the event, which might be seen as a selfish or immature reaction, especially if the girlfriend is willing to engage with the family despite the rules.\n\nThe key points: The author's anger is about perceived unfair treatment. His decision to not attend may be a way to assert his boundaries, but it could also be seen as not valuing the girlfriend's family's traditions. The girlfriend is caught between her partner and her family, which is tough.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it depends on whether his reaction is proportionate. Insisting on sharing a tent is understandable, but refusing to attend because he can't get his way might be seen as not compromising. However, the family's rules are arbitrary (applying to them but not others), so his stance has merit. The answer may lean on cultural expectations and personal boundaries.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong. The family's rules are inconsistent, and his frustration is valid. But his decision to not attend might be extreme. It's a conflict between personal autonomy and respecting family wishes. Since the girlfriend supports his viewpoint but is upset about his refusal to go, maybe the issue is more about how to handle the conflict rather than who is in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the family's rules are the root issue here, not the author's reaction.\n"
