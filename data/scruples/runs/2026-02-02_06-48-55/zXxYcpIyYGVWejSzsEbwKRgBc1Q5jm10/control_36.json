Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other younger couples are allowed. The author is upset, feels it's unfair, and decides not to go this year, causing conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The girlfriend's family has a policy against the couple sharing a tent, but when other couples (younger and less established) do it, there's no problem. The author is frustrated because he feels targeted. He's been told they can share a tent next year, but when it comes up again, the family reverses their decision. The girlfriend agrees with him but refuses to let him talk to her parents. He then refuses to go, leading to her being very upset.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The author's side is that he's being treated unfairly. The family's side might be that they have their own rules, maybe based on their values or what they consider appropriate for their daughter. The girlfriend seems to support the author but is caught between her family and her partner's feelings.\n\nIs the author wrong for refusing to attend? Well, he's standing up for his feelings and the unfair treatment. It's reasonable to feel insulted in this situation. However, maybe he could have handled it differently, like trying to find a compromise. But given that the family is being inconsistent, his frustration is valid.\n\nThe girlfriend's family's stance might be based on their own beliefs, but it's problematic because they allow others to do the same. The author's decision to not go is a reaction to being treated unfairly. He's not being aggressive, just stating his boundaries. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling caught between family and partner. \n\nSo, the main issue is the family's inconsistency. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate in something that makes him uncomfortable, especially when others aren't held to the same standard. The answer should be B, No.\n"
