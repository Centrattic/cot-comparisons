Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout for two years, while other couples who are younger or have been together less time are allowed to. The author feels this is unfair and decides not to go, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's frustration is understandable. They're in a long-term relationship, and being forced to sleep separately in a family event where others aren't held to the same standard could feel disrespectful. The girlfriend's family's reasoning might be based on their values or trying to maintain family harmony, especially around kids. However, the author's reaction is to not attend the campout, which upsets his girlfriend who wanted to go and insisted everything would be okay.\n\nThe key points to consider: The author's right to feel respected in his relationship, the girlfriend's family's cultural or personal boundaries, and the communication between the couple. The author tried to resolve it by talking to the family, but when that didn't work, he decided not to attend. His girlfriend is upset because he's not going, and he's upset because he feels disrespected.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his relationship's comfort and privacy, which is valid. But he's also making a choice that affects his girlfriend's family event. The girlfriend's family's stance might be based on their beliefs, even if they seem outdated. However, the fact that other couples are allowed to share tents complicates things, suggesting the rule isn't consistently applied.\n\nThe author's girlfriend initially agreed with him, but the family changed their decision again. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as a personal choice to maintain his comfort, which isn't inherently wrong. But maybe he could have handled it differently, like discussing boundaries more privately or setting expectations with the family beforehand.\n\nIn terms of being an 'asshole', it's about whether his actions were unreasonable. He's expressing his feelings and making a choice based on them. The girlfriend's family's actions also have their own issues. So maybe the blame isn't solely on the author. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not attending because he feels disrespected, and the girlfriend is upset because he's not going, it's a conflict between two valid perspectives. But the author isn't necessarily the asshole here. He's standing up for his relationship's needs, even if it causes tension. Alternatively, some might argue he's overreacting to a family tradition. But given the inconsistency in the rules (others allowed to share), his stance makes sense.\n\nSo the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a better angle. The author did try to resolve it, and the girlfriend's family didn't budge. His decision to not attend is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's upset is more about his choice conflicting with her desire to attend. The author isn't in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
