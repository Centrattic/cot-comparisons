Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout. The author is upset because other couples of younger age are allowed to share tents, while they're not. He ends up not going to the campout and the girlfriend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for a year, and they're both 26. The family's reasoning is about setting a good example for the kids. The author feels it's unfair, especially when other couples aren't restricted. The girlfriend agrees with him, but her parents are still insistent on separate tents. The author then decides not to go to the next campout, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the key points to analyze. The author's frustration is understandable. He's an adult, in a committed relationship, and the family's rules seem inconsistent since other couples are allowed to share. The girlfriend's family's stance might stem from traditional values or wanting to maintain a family-friendly environment. However, the author's decision to back out of the campout entirely could be seen as a conflict-avoidance tactic, but maybe he's justified in feeling disrespected.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She initially supports the author but then insists he go, even though her parents denied the request again. The author feels that not going is his right, but the girlfriend is upset. This shows a conflict in their relationship, possibly about how to handle family expectations versus personal boundaries.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his relationship's autonomy, which is valid. However, walking away from a family event due to the family's rules might not be the best approach. Maybe there's a middle ground, like a private tent somewhere away from others. But the family's refusal to budge might be the real issue here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision not to attend the campout could be seen as not respecting his partner's wishes, as she wants him to go. This creates tension. So, the question is whether he overreacted by not going. If the family's rules are inflexible, maybe the author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. But if the girlfriend's family's stance is causing unnecessary conflict, the author's frustration is reasonable.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He's standing up for his relationship, and the family's rules are inconsistent. However, his approach might have been too extreme by not attending. There's a balance between asserting personal boundaries and respecting family traditions. The girlfriend's role here is also a factor\u2014she might need to mediate better between her family and her partner's needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I didn't miss any key points. The author's anger at the inconsistency is valid, and his decision to not go if they can't share a tent is a personal choice. The girlfriend's upset is about him not going, but the root issue is the family's restrictions. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
