Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples are. The author is upset and decides not to go, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend's family says it's inappropriate for their 26-year-old couple to share a tent, but other younger couples can. The author feels this is unfair and that his girlfriend's family is being hypocritical. He agrees to not share a tent the first time but is upset when others do. Then, when they try again the next year and the family still says no, he refuses to attend, causing his girlfriend to be upset.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is upset about unequal treatment, feels personally insulted, and walks away from the event. The girlfriend is trying to mediate but her family is enforcing the rule. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, the author's perspective is that the family's rules are unfair. But maybe he's overreacting? If the family has their own rules and the girlfriend is still in a relationship with them, maybe the author should respect their wishes. However, the author's feelings about not being treated equally are valid. The girlfriend's family is applying a rule inconsistently, which is a problem. The author is standing up for himself and his relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend is trying to navigate her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. But when the author decides not to attend, maybe he should have communicated better or found a compromise. But given the situation, if the family isn't willing to change their stance, maybe the author is justified in not attending. The girlfriend's frustration might come from feeling torn between her family and her partner. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the importance of the event and the relationship. If the author values his relationship with his girlfriend, maybe he should try to attend despite the discomfort. On the other hand, if the family's rules are disrespectful or hypocritical, the author has a right to set boundaries. The answer here would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the family's inconsistency is an issue, and the author is asserting his needs. However, there's a balance between respecting family traditions and personal boundaries. The author might not be entirely wrong, but the girlfriend's perspective is also valid in wanting to maintain family relationships. It's a complex situation, but the author's stance seems justified given the unfair treatment.\n"
