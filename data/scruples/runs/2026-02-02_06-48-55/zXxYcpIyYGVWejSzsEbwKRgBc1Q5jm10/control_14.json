Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, even though other younger couples are. The author is frustrated and decided not to go this year, leading to his girlfriend being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that it's unfair since they're a long-term couple and others are sharing tents without issue. He felt it was an insult and wanted to avoid it, which led to conflict with his girlfriend. She agreed last year it would be okay this year, but the family changed their mind after discussing with others. The author then refuses to attend, causing her to be angry.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, like trying to set a good example for kids, even if it seems hypocritical. The author's girlfriend might value family time and not want to risk not getting along with her relatives. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over his partner's relationship with her family.\n\nBut the key points here are the family's inconsistency. If they allow other couples to share tents, their reasoning for keeping the author and his girlfriend separate seems inconsistent. The author's frustration is valid because it's unfair treatment. However, his reaction of refusing to go might have been abrupt, especially if his girlfriend was trying to maintain family harmony. \n\nThe girlfriend agreed with him last year but then the family changed their stance. The author might feel let down, and his concern about being treated differently is understandable. However, the way he communicated his refusal (maybe not being patient or understanding) could be a problem. The girlfriend might feel he's not respecting her family's decision, even if it's inconsistent, which could cause her distress. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the family is indeed being hypocritical, then the author's anger is justified. But if he was too quick to refuse without considering the impact on his girlfriend's family dynamics, that's where he might be wrong. The fact that he was willing to talk to her parents but she refused might indicate that the parents' decision is strict and not easily changed. The author's ultimatum could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the effort to keep the family event peaceful. \n\nTherefore, while the family's rules are questionable, the author's decision to not attend based on that could be the problem. He might be the asshole for not compromising, even if the family isn't being fair. So the answer is A.\n"
