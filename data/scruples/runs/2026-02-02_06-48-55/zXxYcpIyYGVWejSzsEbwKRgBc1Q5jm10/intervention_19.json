Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples there (some younger and with less dating history) are allowed to. The author feels this is unfair and ends up deciding not to attend the next year's event, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's main issue is about fairness and personal boundaries. He was promised that next year they'd share a tent, but the family changed their stance again. He feels insulted and frustrated. On the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons for the rule, possibly cultural or traditional, and the girlfriend is trying to maintain family harmony. \n\nThe author's girlfriend agreed with him that it was unfair, but her parents overruled it. The author then refuses to attend unless they can share a tent, which leads to conflict. The key points here are consent, respect for boundaries, and the impact on relationships. \n\nThe author's actions (not attending and pushing for his own terms) could be seen as standing up for himself, but it also strains the relationship with his girlfriend and her family. The girlfriend is caught between her partner's wishes and her family's expectations. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset about the unfair treatment, but his decision to not attend might be seen as taking a stance that disregards his girlfriend's position and her family's dynamics. However, the girlfriend's family's rule is the root issue here. The author's frustration is understandable, but maybe he could have found a compromise. \n\nAlternatively, the author is in the right to prioritize his comfort and relationship boundaries. If the family isn't respecting his partner's agreement, then pushing back is justified. But since the girlfriend is upset, it's a conflict between two valid perspectives. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He's standing up for himself in a situation where he feels unfairly treated. However, his approach might have been too rigid. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's a middle ground. But based on the options, A or B, I need to decide. The initial thought was the author is in the wrong (A), but after considering, maybe he's not. So probably B.\n"
