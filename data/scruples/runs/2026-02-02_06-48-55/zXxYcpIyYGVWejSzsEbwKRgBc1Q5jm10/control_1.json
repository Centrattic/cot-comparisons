Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout. The key points here are the family's rules, the couple's relationship status, and the conflict that arises.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend are both 26 and have been dating for a year. The family's objection is about setting a bad example for the kids. But then, other younger couples come and share tents without any issue. That's a big inconsistency. The author feels singled out and insulted because the rules don't apply to others. \n\nThe girlfriend initially promises that next year they can share a tent, but when the time comes, the family reverses the decision after consulting with other adults. The author then refuses to attend the campout, leading to a conflict with the girlfriend. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, the family's rules seem hypocritical. The author's reaction is understandable given that the same rules aren't applied to others. The girlfriend agreed with him last year but couldn't get her parents to change their stance. The author is standing by his decision not to attend because of the unfair treatment. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a cultural or family norm that's important here. Sometimes families have strict rules for their own reasons, even if they seem inconsistent. The girlfriend might be caught between her partner and her family, leading to her frustration. \n\nBut the main issue is the hypocrisy. The family allowed others to share tents, which undermines their own rule. The author isn't wrong to feel upset about being treated differently. His refusal is a reaction to being unfairly singled out. The girlfriend's family's inconsistency is the root problem. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
