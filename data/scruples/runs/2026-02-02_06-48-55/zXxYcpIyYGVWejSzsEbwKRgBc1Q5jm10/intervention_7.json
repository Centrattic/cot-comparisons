Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The story is about a couple where the girlfriend's family insists they don't share a tent at a family campout, while other couples, even younger ones, do. The author is upset and decides not to go to the campout, causing conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The family's rule is about appropriateness, but it's applied unevenly. The author feels it's unfair, especially since he and his girlfriend have been together longer than the other couples present. His girlfriend initially agrees they'll share a tent next year, but the family reverses the decision. The author then refuses to attend, leading to the girlfriend's anger.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. He's frustrated with the family's inconsistency and feels personally targeted. His response is to walk away from the event, which is a valid personal choice, but he's causing tension with his girlfriend. The main issue is whether his refusal is justified or if he overreacted.\n\nThe girlfriend's side is important too. She's caught between her family's traditions and her partner's feelings. She tried to negotiate but the family's stance didn't change. She might feel pressured to maintain family harmony and might not want to rock the boat. The author's refusal to attend might be seen as taking sides against her family, which could be frustrating for her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his boundaries and the unfair treatment. On the other hand, he's causing conflict by not attending, which his girlfriend didn't want. The question is whether his reaction is proportionate. He's not being disrespectful to the family directly, just choosing not to participate in an event he finds offensive. His girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling that he's undermining her position or adding stress to the relationship.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the family's rule is inconsistent, and the author's resentment is understandable. However, his decision to withdraw from the event could be seen as selfish from the girlfriend's perspective, especially if she wanted to attend and manage the situation. The answer might depend on whether the author's refusal is a justified expression of his feelings or an overreaction that's harming the relationship.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. Since the family's rules are unfair and the author is clear about his reasons, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend feels he's being too rigid and not compromising, he might be partly at fault. But given the family's inconsistency, his stance could be justified. So, probably answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
