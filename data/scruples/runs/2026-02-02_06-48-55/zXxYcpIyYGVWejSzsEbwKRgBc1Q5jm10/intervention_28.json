Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a couple's family not allowing them to share a tent at a camping event, which the author finds unfair and eventually decides not to attend, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives involved. The author's main grievance is that his girlfriend's family imposed a rule on them that didn't apply to others. He found it hypocritical and felt insulted. He tried to compromise initially but after the second year, when the same issue arose, he refused to attend. His girlfriend wanted him to go and was upset when he didn't. The question is whether he's in the wrong for that decision.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a valid point about the inconsistency. The family allowed other, younger couples to share tents but didn't allow him and his girlfriend, which seems unfair. His frustration is understandable, especially since they've been dating a year and are both adults. The fact that the family made an exception for others but not for them could be seen as hypocritical, and his reaction stems from feeling disrespected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a relationship with the family's daughter. Choosing to not attend a family event could be seen as a breach of relationship expectations. While his reasons are valid, the decision to not attend might have caused unnecessary strain on the relationship. The girlfriend was upset because she wanted him to attend, even if the arrangement wasn't ideal. The author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over maintaining family relations, which might place the burden on the girlfriend to mediate, which she didn't handle well either.\n\nAnother angle is the communication aspect. The author tried to talk to his girlfriend's parents but was stopped by her, and when the issue wasn't resolved, he made a firm decision to not go. The girlfriend agreed initially but then changed her stance, leading to conflict. His stance is about respecting his own boundaries, but maybe he should have found another way to address the issue without entirely exiting the situation.\n\nAlso, considering the impact on the relationship: the author is prioritizing his personal boundaries over attending a family event, which is a valid choice. However, the girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests that the decision affected her negatively. The question is whether his action is justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the family's rule was inconsistent, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. However, his response might be too extreme by not attending, especially if he could have found a middle ground or discussed it more with his girlfriend to find a solution without cutting out the event entirely.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, I think the author is not in the wrong. His frustration is justified due to the inconsistent treatment, and he's standing up for his relationship's privacy. However, the way he handled it might have caused unnecessary conflict. But the core issue is the family's unfair policy, so the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
