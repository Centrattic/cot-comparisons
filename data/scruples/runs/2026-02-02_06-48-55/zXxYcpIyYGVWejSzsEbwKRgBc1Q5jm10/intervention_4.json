Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, even though other younger couples are allowed to. The author is upset and decides not to attend, causing the girlfriend to get very upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's family might have their reasons, like wanting to keep things family-appropriate for the kids present. They could be following their own rules or cultural norms. The author, on the other hand, feels it's unfair, especially after others are allowed to share tents. He also mentions the girlfriend agreed to share a tent last year, but this year they reverted without explanation.\n\nNow, the key points are: the couple is in a committed, year-long relationship, the family's rules seem inconsistent (other couples are allowed to share), the author tried to talk to the family but was prevented by the girlfriend, and he's now refusing to attend, which upsets her. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to go? If he's made it clear that this rule affected his experience and he's standing by his decision, maybe not. But if he's letting it ruin the event and not being open to compromise, maybe he is. The girlfriend's family might have legitimate concerns, but the inconsistency could be the real issue. The author's frustration is understandable, but his response of refusing to attend might be seen as extreme. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is upset because he's not going, possibly prioritizing her family's traditions over their relationship. The author might need to consider if his reaction is reasonable. Maybe there's a middle ground, like a separate tent in a less public area. But since others were allowed to share without issue, the family's stance seems hypocritical. \n\nHowever, the author's main issue is feeling personally insulted, which is valid. But is it right to withdraw from the event entirely? It depends on the context. The girlfriend agreed to the tent issue this year, so the author's refusal might cause unnecessary conflict. \n\nIn the end, the family's rules are their choice, and the author's reaction might be disproportionate. So the answer is A.\n"
