Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout. The family allows other couples, even some younger and less established, to share tents, but not the author and his girlfriend. The author is upset, feels insulted, and decides not to go to the campout this year, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the perspectives here. The author's main issue is about fairness and double standards. The family is applying different rules to different couples, which he finds hypocritical. He's been patient, tried to work within the system (waiting a year, getting his girlfriend to mediate), but the outcome didn't change. His refusal to attend this year is a reaction to what he perceives as unjust treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons based on their values or cultural norms. Maybe they have specific rules for the family event, aiming to maintain a certain atmosphere or protect younger family members. However, their enforcement of these rules seems inconsistent when compared to other couples present.\n\nThe girlfriend agreed with the author's frustration and promised that next year they would share a tent, but the family then changed their stance. The author then decides not to attend, which the girlfriend is upset about. Here, the conflict is between the author's feelings of being unfairly treated and the girlfriend's prioritization of family time over his personal discomfort.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his boundaries and feelings, which is valid. But he's also choosing not to attend an event that his girlfriend seems to want him to attend. This might affect their relationship dynamics. However, the core issue is the family's double standard. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about that. The family's actions are likely the main issue here. The girlfriend's insistence that he attend despite his objections might be where the problem lies, but the question is about the author. His decision not to attend due to the treatment is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
