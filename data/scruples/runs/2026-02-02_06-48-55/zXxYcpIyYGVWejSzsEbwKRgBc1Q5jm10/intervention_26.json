Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, which causes tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's girlfriend's family made a rule that they couldn't share a tent, but other couples who arrived later, even younger ones, did share tents without any issues. The author felt this was unfair and that the family was being hypocritical. He expressed his frustration, and the girlfriend agreed and promised it would change the next year. However, when trying to resolve it again, her family said they needed to talk to other adults, and then again refused. The author decided not to go to the campout, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The author's stance is that the family's rule is unfair, especially since others weren't held to the same standard. The girlfriend tried to mediate, and the author felt personally targeted. The author's refusal to attend might be seen as a reasonable response to feeling respected or not. However, his girlfriend is upset because he's not going, which complicates things. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could be overreacting by not attending and maybe not handling the situation more diplomatically. But the family's inconsistency (allowing others to share but not them) might support his frustration. The girlfriend's family's rules could be based on their own values, but the inconsistency is a problem. The author's actions leading to a breakdown in communication might be where the issue lies. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The family's double standard is a significant issue, and the author's response is a reaction to that. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there's a nuance I'm missing, like the importance of the girlfriend's perspective or if the author's refusal to attend was too harsh. However, given the family's refusal to budge despite the inconsistency, the author's decision to prioritize his comfort is understandable.\n"
