Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple's conflict over sharing a tent at a family campout.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's family didn't let them share a tent last year because they thought it's a bad example for kids. The author was annoyed but went along. This year, other couples came in and shared tents, which made him even more upset. He felt it was unfair, especially since they were together longer. He mentioned it to his girlfriend, who agreed to talk to her parents. The next year, after some back and forth, the family still didn't allow it. The author then refused to go, causing his girlfriend to be upset.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's frustration is understandable. The family's rules seem inconsistent, especially when others are allowed to share tents. However, the key point is whether the author was in the wrong for not attending the campout. His girlfriend's family's decision is their prerogative, especially if it's a family tradition. The author might feel disrespected, but the girlfriend tried to mediate. The author's refusal to attend might have been a personal choice to stand his ground, but it caused conflict with his girlfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family's stance is about their values and setting an example for kids. The author's decision to not go could be seen as respecting the family's wishes or as giving up. But since he's in a relationship, it's a balance between his wishes and his girlfriend's family's rules. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she prioritizes family harmony over his discomfort.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He wasn't violating any rules by not sharing the tent. However, by refusing to attend, he might be prioritizing his own feelings over the relationship. The girlfriend's upset reaction indicates that his choice affected her. The answer might depend on cultural context and relationship dynamics. But given the information, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The inconsistency from the family's side is an issue, and his refusal to attend could be seen as a reasonable response to feeling disrespected.\n"
