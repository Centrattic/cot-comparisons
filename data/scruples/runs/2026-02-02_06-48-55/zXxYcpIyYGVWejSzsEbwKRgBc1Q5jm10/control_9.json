Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the girlfriend's family doesn't let them share a tent at their annual campout. The author is 26, with his girlfriend, and they've been dating a year. The family thinks it's inappropriate and sets a bad example for the kids. The author is annoyed because he's sleeping in a ground pimple while his girlfriend has all the nice gear. Then, other younger couples come and share tents without any issues. He's upset because they're the only couple separated, even though they've been together longer. He tells his girlfriend that if they don't get to share a tent again, he won't go. She agrees they should next year. But then, when they try to get the parents' permission the next year, the family says they have to be separate again. The author refuses to go, and his girlfriend is upset with him.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's reactions and what's considered reasonable. The family's stance is based on their values, thinking it's inappropriate for their daughter to share a tent with her boyfriend. The author feels this is unfair, especially since other couples are allowed to. He's frustrated because he's been accommodating, but now refuses to attend when his conditions aren't met. His girlfriend is upset that he's not going and that he's not talking directly to her parents.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his own needs and boundaries. It's understandable that sharing a tent is important for a couple's privacy and intimacy. The family's policy is restrictive, and the author is not the one imposing it. However, he's choosing not to attend the campout, which is a social event that's important to his girlfriend. His decision might be causing hurt feelings because it's affecting the family event. But from his perspective, he's not willing to go under those conditions. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend agreed with him the previous year and said they'd share a tent next year. The family changed their mind without considering their input, and the author is frustrated because he feels disrespected. His girlfriend's family is making the rules, and he's not the one enforcing them. So, it's a conflict between family values and the couple's relationship needs.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his boundaries. The family's rules are the root cause here. However, maybe he could have communicated better with his girlfriend to find a compromise, but his refusal to attend is a personal choice. The girlfriend's upset might stem from the impact on her family event, but the author's feelings are valid too. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
