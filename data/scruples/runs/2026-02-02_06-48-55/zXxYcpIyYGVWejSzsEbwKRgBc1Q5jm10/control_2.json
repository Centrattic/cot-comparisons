Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend's family not allowing the couple to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples there are allowed to. The author is upset about being treated differently and decides not to go this year, causing conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's girlfriend's family is enforcing a rule that separates them, possibly due to conservative views or family traditions. The author finds this unfair, especially since other couples aren't affected. He communicated his frustration, and the girlfriend agreed last year that they'd share a tent next time. But this year, the family still said no, leading the author to refuse going. The girlfriend is upset because he's not attending.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's standing up for his comfort and relationship boundaries. The family's rule seems inconsistent, as other couples aren't restricted. The author's decision not to attend could be seen as prioritizing his needs, which is understandable. However, maybe he should have tried to talk to the family himself, as he offered but was prevented. The girlfriend's insistence on him going despite his objections might indicate she's more focused on family harmony, which can be important. But the author isn't doing anything unethical; he's expressing his feelings. The family's policy might be the real issue here. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author has valid reasons for his actions, and the situation points more to the family's inconsistency than his wrongdoing.\n"
