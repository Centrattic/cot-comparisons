Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple where the girlfriend's family doesn't let them share a tent during a family campout. The author is frustrated because other couples, even younger ones, are allowed to share tents, but he and his girlfriend aren't. He felt it was unfair and inconsiderate, so he decided not to go this year, which upset his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's main issue is that he and his girlfriend are being treated differently from other couples. They've been together longer, and he felt it was hypocritical that others are allowed to share tents without any issues. His frustration builds up over two years, and he finally decides that if they can't share a tent again, he won't attend. His girlfriend agreed last year that next year they would share, but the family reversed the decision, and she didn't want him to confront them.\n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong. Well, he's standing up for his boundaries. If the family's rules are causing him significant discomfort and he's communicating that, it's his right to decide not to attend if those conditions aren't met. However, his girlfriend is upset because he's not going, which might be a relationship issue. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not necessarily the girlfriend.\n\nThe family's stance might be based on their values or trying to set an example for kids, but if they're inconsistent (letting other couples share tents), that's part of the problem. The author isn't doing anything wrong by not attending if the situation isn't acceptable to him. The key point is mutual respect in a relationship. If the girlfriend's family's demands are making the author feel disrespected, he has the right to express that and make choices based on his comfort.\n\nSo the answer is probably B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's asserting his feelings and boundaries, which is reasonable. The family's inconsistency and the girlfriend's refusal to support his request might be the real issues here.\n"
