Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family camping trip where the girlfriend's family doesn't allow the couple to share a tent, even though other younger couples do. The author is upset about this and decides not to go this year, which makes the girlfriend upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author and his girlfriend are both 26 and have been dating a year. Last year, the family made them sleep separately, but others who are younger and in relationships for less time shared tents. This year, after agreeing they would share a tent, the family again said no, leading the author to refuse to attend. His girlfriend is upset with him for not going and for not talking to her parents.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the family's rules about tents and the author's decision to not attend. The author feels it's unfair that they're the only ones being separated, especially when others aren't. He's frustrated and wants to talk to the parents, but the girlfriend won't let him. He then refuses to go, which upsets her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from his perspective, the situation seems unfair. The family's rules are inconsistent, and being the only couple separated could make him and his girlfriend feel singled out. His decision not to attend is a reaction to being treated unfairly. However, the girlfriend is upset because he didn't go and because he wanted to talk to her parents. \n\nBut then, is there a cultural or family norm here? Maybe the family has certain expectations or values that they follow, which might not be the same as the author's. The girlfriend might be trying to maintain family harmony, hence not wanting the author to confront her parents. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as disrespecting the family's traditions or her wishes. But at the same time, the author's feelings of being treated unfairly are valid.\n\nThe girlfriend seems to support the author's stance initially but then her family backs out. The author's frustration is understandable. However, his decision to not attend might be seen as a selfish response, especially if the girlfriend is trying to mediate and make it work. The author's choice to not attend could strain their relationship further, but if the family isn't willing to compromise, maybe it's a reasonable stand to take for his own comfort.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, relationships involve compromise. The author is standing up for his feelings, but the girlfriend is also trying to navigate her family dynamics. The answer might hinge on whether the author overstepped by refusing to attend. If the issue is about personal boundaries and the family isn't respecting them despite the girlfriend's efforts, then maybe he's not wrong. But if the problem is about not respecting the girlfriend's attempts to handle it her way, then he might be in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key factors are the fairness of the family's rules and whether the author's reaction is proportionate. Since others are allowed to share tents, the family's rule seems inconsistent. The author's anger stems from being treated differently, which is a valid reaction. The girlfriend's upset might be about the author not attending and not respecting her family's decision, but if the family is being unfair, her support for his initial stance and then the conflict might indicate a deeper issue in the relationship. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the family's rules are inconsistent and unfair. His decision not to attend is a response to being treated differently, and he's trying to communicate his feelings. The girlfriend's upset might be more about the conflict than the issue itself. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
