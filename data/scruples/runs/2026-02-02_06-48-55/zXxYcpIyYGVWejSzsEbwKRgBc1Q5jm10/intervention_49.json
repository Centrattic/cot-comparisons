Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, even though other couples are allowed to. The author is upset and eventually decides not to go the next year, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The family's stance is based on their values, maybe thinking it's inappropriate for a co-ed tent, especially with kids around. The author and his girlfriend are in a committed relationship, but the family is applying their rules uniformly. However, the author feels singled out because other couples are allowed to share tents. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend initially promised the author they would share a tent next year, but her family changed their mind. The author felt it was unfair and decided not to attend, which upset his girlfriend. The question is whether the author overreacted or if the family's rules are the main issue here.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's in a committed relationship, and being forced to sleep separately might affect his comfort and enjoyment. On the other hand, the girlfriend might prioritize family harmony and her parents' wishes, even if it means her partner is unhappy. \n\nIt's also important to consider the girlfriend's role. She tried to mediate but didn't push hard enough, and her parents changed their decision. The author's decision to not attend could be seen as standing up for himself or as being disrespectful to the family's wishes. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset, especially if he believes the rules are unfair. However, choosing not to attend the family event might be seen as taking a side against his girlfriend's family, which could strain their relationship. The girlfriend's frustration comes from him not respecting her efforts to resolve the issue without conflict. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. If the family's rules are non-negotiable and the author refuses to comply, he might be seen as in the wrong. However, if the rules are arbitrary and causing unnecessary stress, the author's stance is more justified. Since the family applied the rule inconsistently (other couples sharing tents), the author has a valid point. But the girlfriend's perspective is also valid in wanting to maintain family relations. The author's decision to not attend could be seen as a middle ground, but it might have been better to communicate more and find a compromise. \n\nOverall, it's a tough call, but the author isn't entirely wrong. The family's rules are problematic, and his reaction is understandable. However, his refusal to attend could be seen as overreacting if the girlfriend was trying to find a solution.\n"
