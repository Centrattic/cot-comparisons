Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. The author and his girlfriend, who is 26, went to a family campout where they weren't allowed to share a tent. The parents and family members thought it would set a bad example for the kids. The author thought it was stupid because they're both adults and had been dating for a year. He went along with it, expecting next year they could share a tent. But then, other couples who are younger and less experienced were allowed to share tents without any issue. The author got angry, and after the first year, he told his girlfriend that if they can't share a tent next year, he won't come. The next year, after some back and forth, the family again said they have to be separate. The author refuses to go and the girlfriend is upset. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The main points are the family's rules about sharing a tent, the inconsistency with other couples, and the author's reaction. The family's reasoning is about setting a good example for the kids. But the author feels it's unfair and hypocritical when others aren't held to the same standard. The girlfriend agreed with him after the first year, but her family still enforced the rule again the next year. The author decides not to go, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, is the author wrong for not going? Well, the family's rules are their own, but the inconsistency might be a problem. The author's frustration is understandable because they're being treated differently than others. If the family is applying the rule inconsistently, maybe the author has a point in feeling it's unfair. However, the family might still have their own reasons, even if they're not perfectly consistent.\n\nBut the author's main issue is that he's choosing not to attend the family event because of this. The girlfriend wants him to go, even if it's uncomfortable. Is that a reasonable request? The author is prioritizing his own comfort and the fairness of the situation over attending the family gathering. On the other hand, maybe the girlfriend is in a position where she can't confront her family about their rules, and the author's refusal to attend is causing her distress. \n\nIs the author within his rights to decline? If the family is making it impossible for him to be comfortable, maybe not attending isn't wrong. However, the girlfriend might feel that he's overreacting. The key here is whether the author's reaction is proportionate to the issue. The family's rule might be a personal choice, and while the inconsistency is a problem, the author's decision to not attend could be seen as taking a stand, but also as being inflexible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author could have found a compromise, like attending but being separate, even if it's annoying. But if he's genuinely upset and it's ruining the experience, then not going might be his choice. The question is whether that makes him the asshole. The girlfriend is upset, so maybe he's not wrong, but maybe he could have handled it better.\n\nIn terms of the options, the user thinks the author is in the wrong (A) but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. The author's main argument is about fairness and being treated differently, but the family's rules are their own. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as not respecting the family's wishes, but also as standing up for his and his girlfriend's relationship dynamics. The girlfriend's family might not be open to changing their stance, so the author's choice to not attend might be a valid personal decision. However, if the girlfriend is upset, maybe the author should have found another way to handle it. But given the situation, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer could be B.\n"
