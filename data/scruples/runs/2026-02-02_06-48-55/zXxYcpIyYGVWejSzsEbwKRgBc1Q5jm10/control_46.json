Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's family has a family campout every year. Last year, they weren't allowed to share a tent because the family thought it's inappropriate and sets a bad example for the kids. The author is 26, in a year-long relationship, and found this rule stupid but went along with it because the girlfriend promised they'd share a tent next time. The problem is that other couples who are younger and in shorter relationships were allowed to share tents, which made the author furious. He felt singled out and insulted. After the first campout, he told the girlfriend it ruined the experience, and she agreed they'd share a tent next year.\n\nThen, the next year, the author had to push the girlfriend to talk to her parents again. She didn't want the author to talk to them, and the parents said they needed to talk to other adults. They came back and said they still couldn't share a tent. The author then refused to go, leading to the girlfriend being very upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's consider the perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's side: He's an adult in a committed relationship. He feels that the family's rule is hypocritical because other couples don't face the same restrictions. He's frustrated because he's being treated differently without a valid reason. The camping trip is a family event, but the rule seems to target him specifically, causing him distress. He's standing up for himself and his relationship boundaries.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She might be under pressure from her family, possibly wanting to maintain good relations with them. She might feel that the family's rules are important, even if they seem unfair. She agreed with the author's frustration after the first event but couldn't get her parents to change their stance. She's upset because he's refusing to attend, which could affect family dynamics or her own relationships.\n\nThe author's refusal to attend is a reaction to being treated unfairly. However, maybe the girlfriend is caught between her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. The author might not be in the wrong for standing up for his boundaries. On the other hand, his refusal could be seen as selfish if it causes distress to the girlfriend and her family. But considering the circumstances, the author's feelings are valid\u2014being singled out in a family event can be hurtful.\n\nThe family's stance might be based on outdated or inconsistent rules. The fact that other couples are allowed to share tents suggests hypocrisy, which the author rightly points out. The author isn't necessarily being an asshole for not wanting to comply with an unfair rule, especially when it's affecting his enjoyment and respect in the relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to be treated fairly in a family setting. The girlfriend's family's inconsistency is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
