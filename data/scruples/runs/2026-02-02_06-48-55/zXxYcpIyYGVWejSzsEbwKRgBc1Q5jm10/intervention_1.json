Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author and their girlfriend not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples who are younger and have been together less time are allowed. The author feels it's unfair and decides not to go to the next campout, which upsets his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's perspective is that they're being treated differently and it's unfair. They had an agreement with their girlfriend that next year they'd share a tent, but when it came time, the family refused again. The author feels personally insulted and doesn't want to attend if they have to sleep separately. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is upset that the author is refusing to go and not talking directly to her parents.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let's break down the key points. The family's rules might be based on their values, perhaps wanting to maintain a certain standard in front of the kids. The author's response is to not attend the event, which is a significant consequence. The girlfriend is caught in the middle, trying to mediate between her partner and her family.\n\nIs the author right to feel wronged? They might be overreacting if the family's decision is based on their own beliefs, even if it seems inconsistent. The author could have tried to talk to the family directly as they offered, but the girlfriend didn't let them. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from her not wanting her partner to confront her family, which could cause more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid\u2014feeling treated unfairly, especially when others are allowed to do what they want. The inconsistency in the family's rules is a real issue. However, the author's solution of not going might be seen as a selfish response that doesn't consider the girlfriend's position. Maybe there's a middle ground, like finding an alternative arrangement or compromising.\n\nConsidering the cultural context, some families have strict norms about such things. The author's reaction might be reasonable if they feel the rules are unreasonable, but refusing to attend entirely could be seen as extreme. The girlfriend's upset reaction suggests that the author's actions are hurting her, even if the family's stance is a factor.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's merit to the author's frustration, their decision to not attend might be seen as taking a stance that prioritizes their own comfort over the girlfriend's desire to maintain family relations. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the right, but the situation is nuanced. However, the user's initial thought is the author is wrong. I need to check if the reasoning supports that.\n"
