Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend's family didn't let them share a tent at a family campout, even though other younger couples were allowed. The author is upset and decided not to go next time, which made the girlfriend angry. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're curious about the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The family's reasoning was about setting a good example for the kids. Even though the author is 26 and in a one-year relationship, maybe the family has strict traditional values where they don't want their children to see couples sharing a tent, regardless of age or relationship status. The fact that other couples were allowed might be because those were friends of the cousins, and the family might not have the same level of involvement or concern about their example. Or perhaps the other couples were considered less \"serious\" by the family, even if they were younger. \n\nThe author is frustrated because they were promised they could share a tent next time, but when it came around, the family changed their mind and made exceptions for others. They felt it was unfair and insulting, leading them to refuse to attend again. The girlfriend is upset because he's not going and she might feel he's overreacting or disrespecting her family's rules. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to comply with the family's request after feeling it's a double standard? Well, it's understandable to feel insulted if you're treated differently from others in a situation where you're given the same or more relationship standing. But maybe the author did overreact by not attending the next year, especially if the girlfriend was okay with it. The girlfriend agreed with the author's feelings last year but this year, the family's stance changed. \n\nAlso, the author was \"harassed\" by the girlfriend to bring up the tent-sharing issue with her parents, but she didn't want him to talk to them. So the author is upset because they were treated differently and the family isn't consistent, which is a fair point. However, the author's solution was to not attend, which might have been the wrong approach if the girlfriend was invested in the family event and wanted to find a compromise. \n\nThe key points here are about the family's rules, the perceived double standard, and the author's reaction. The family might have their own reasons for the change, even if it's not clear to the author. The author's refusal to attend next year could be seen as a selfish decision that disregards the girlfriend's family's customs, even if they feel it's unfair. On the other hand, the author has a right to feel respected and not treated differently. \n\nI think the answer depends on the balance between respecting family traditions and the couple's right to their own privacy. But since the author's reaction was to not attend, leading to conflict with the girlfriend, maybe the author is in the wrong for not finding a middle ground. Alternatively, if the family's rules are unreasonable and the author is justified in feeling disrespected, then he might not be in the wrong. But the girlfriend's role is also important\u2014she might need to mediate between her family and the author's feelings. \n\nIn the end, the family's stance is up to them, but the author's refusal might be seen as a personal choice that prioritizes his own comfort over the girlfriend's family time. The girlfriend is upset because she wanted to go, so the author's decision could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the family's rules are indeed inconsistent, that's a valid grievance. I'm leaning towards B, the author isn't in the wrong because the family's rules are arbitrary and the author's feelings are reasonable. But maybe there's a perspective where the author should have communicated better or found another way to handle it without not attending. Hmm.\n"
