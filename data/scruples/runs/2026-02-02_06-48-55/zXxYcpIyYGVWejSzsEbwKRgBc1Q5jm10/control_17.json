Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend's family doesn't allow them to share a tent at the family campout. They're both 26 and have been dating a year. Last year, they couldn't share a tent, but other younger couples could. The author was annoyed but held it in. This year, the same thing happened again after the family said they needed to talk to other adults. The author refuses to go and causes tension with the girlfriend.\n\nSo, the main points here: The family's rules are inconsistent. They applied the tent rule only to the author and his girlfriend, not others. The author feels it's unfair and insulting. The girlfriend agreed with him last year but couldn't get her family to change their stance this year. The author decides not to go, which upsets the girlfriend.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a fairness perspective, the family's rule is discriminatory. They're applying it selectively, which is unfair. The author's frustration is valid because they're being treated differently than others. However, the author's response was to refuse to attend, which might hurt the girlfriend's feelings. She was trying to mediate and wanted him to go. So, maybe the author's reaction is understandable but perhaps could have been handled better.\n\nBut let's consider the girlfriend's side. She's caught between her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. She might not want to rock the boat with her family, especially if they're the hosts. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as punishing her for her family's rules. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not compromising further, even though the family's actions are unfair.\n\nAlternatively, the author's right to feel respected is valid. Being singled out is hurtful. The family's inconsistency is a problem, but the author's refusal to attend might be a reasonable stand to take for his own comfort. However, the way he's approaching it without talking directly to the family (as he was offered to) could be an issue. But the girlfriend didn't let him. So, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, family events can be tricky. The family's rules might be based on their values, even if they're outdated. The author's frustration is justified, but his response (refusing to attend) might be seen as selfish if it harms the girlfriend's relationship with her family. But if the family isn't willing to budge, the author has the right to prioritize his own comfort.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author isn't entirely wrong. The family's actions are problematic, and his feelings are valid. However, his decision to not attend might have been a knee-jerk reaction. But given the circumstances, it's hard to say he's the asshole. The girlfriend might also share some blame for not standing up more for her partner. But according to the question, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. Answer B.\n"
