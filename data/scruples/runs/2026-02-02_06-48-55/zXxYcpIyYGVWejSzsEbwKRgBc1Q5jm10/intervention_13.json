Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a campout. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend are both 26 and have been dating for a year. The girlfriend's family, including parents and aunts, made them sleep separately last year, saying it's inappropriate and a bad example for the kids. The author was annoyed but went along because the girlfriend promised next year they could share a tent. Then, when others who are younger and in shorter relationships were allowed to share tents, the author felt it was unfair. This year, after trying to get the girlfriend to talk to her parents again, the family said they needed to discuss with other adults and then again told them to be separate. The author now refuses to go, leading to a conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nThe author's main points of frustration are the perceived double standard (others sharing tents but not them) and feeling personally insulted. The girlfriend seems to agree with him but didn't want him to confront her parents. The author is now refusing to attend, which upsets the girlfriend.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. The family's perspective might be based on their values or trying to set an example for younger kids. However, the author's feelings of being treated unfairly and the inconsistency (others allowed to share) are valid. The author's reaction is understandable given the circumstances, but maybe not all of the responsibility lies with the family. The girlfriend might feel caught between her family's expectations and her partner's feelings. \n\nThe author is standing up for his own boundaries and feelings, which is reasonable. However, refusing to attend an event that's important to his girlfriend could be seen as not considering her feelings, especially if she's insistent he should go. The key is whether the author's refusal is justified. If the situation is causing him significant distress and he's not comfortable compromising, it might be okay. But if the girlfriend values the family event more and he's willing to attend despite the discomfort, there's a balance to consider.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset about the double standard and wanting to share a tent. However, his ultimatum (not going if he can't share) might be seen as extreme, given that it affects the girlfriend's relationship with her family. The girlfriend's insistence that he go might indicate the event is important to her, and the author's refusal could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the family's rule might be inflexible, and the author's reaction is a legitimate response to being treated unfairly. The girlfriend's agreement with him suggests she sees the issue too. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's a balance between respecting his own boundaries and his partner's family dynamics. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because his feelings are valid, but there's room for compromise. His refusal to go might be a bit extreme, but given the circumstances, it's a understandable reaction. So I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
