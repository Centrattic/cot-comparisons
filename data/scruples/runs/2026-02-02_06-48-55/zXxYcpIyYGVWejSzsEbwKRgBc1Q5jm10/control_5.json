Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The scenario is about the author and their girlfriend being separated in different tents at a family campout, while other couples can share. The author finds this unfair and decides not to go next year, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the family's reasoning is that it's inappropriate and sets a bad example for the kids. But the author and his girlfriend are 26 and have been dating a year. The family allows other younger couples to share tents. That seems inconsistent. The author's frustration is understandable because they're treated differently despite being in a more established relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend initially agrees that next year they'll share a tent, but when the author tries to address it again, the family brings up the issue again, citing needing to talk to other adults. Then the author refuses to go, which makes the girlfriend upset. \n\nThe key points here are the fairness of the family's rules and the author's response. The family's double standard (others can share but not them) is a problem. The author's decision not to go could be seen as standing up for their boundaries. However, the girlfriend is upset because he's not going against her wishes. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the family's actions are the root issue. The author isn't the one with the problem here. They're reacting to an unfair policy. The girlfriend's family is imposing their rules, which are inconsistent. The author's frustration is valid. But the author's refusal to attend might be seen as a problem because it's causing conflict. However, given the circumstances, he's standing up for himself. The girlfriend might be in a tough spot mediating between her family and her partner. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The family's inconsistency and the author's justified reaction make sense. The real issue is the family's rules, not the author's stance.\n"
