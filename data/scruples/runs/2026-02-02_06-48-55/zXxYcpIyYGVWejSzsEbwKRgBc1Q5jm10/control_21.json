Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family camping trip where the girlfriend's family doesn't allow the couple to share a tent, even though other couples do. The author is frustrated because they feel singled out and the girlfriend's family is being hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and his girlfriend are both 26, in a one-year relationship (now two years?), and the family is applying a double standard. The author's frustration is understandable because they're being treated differently from other couples. The girlfriend initially agrees to talk to her parents but then the family reverses the decision, leading the author to refuse to go.\n\nThe key points are: the family's rules are inconsistent, the author feels disrespected, and the girlfriend is upset when he refuses to attend. The question is whether the author is wrong for not going.\n\nLegally or morally? Well, the author is standing up for his comfort and feelings. Families often have their own rules, but when those rules are applied unfairly, it's reasonable for the individual to push back. The girlfriend's family's hypocrisy (other couples are allowed to share tents) adds to the author's justification. The fact that he tried to discuss it with the parents (through the girlfriend) and they still didn't budge might support his stance.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend is very upset. Maybe she feels pressured to maintain family harmony. But the author's decision not to attend because his boundaries are being disrespected might be valid. The family's actions are the root cause here. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and standing up against what he sees as unfair treatment. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
