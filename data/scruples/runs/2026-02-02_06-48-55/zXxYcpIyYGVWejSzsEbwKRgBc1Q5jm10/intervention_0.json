Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding the camping situation with the girlfriend's family. The author's perspective is that the family\u4e0d\u8ba9 them share a tent, which he finds unfair, especially since other couples at the campout did share tents. He's frustrated and decides not to go next year unless they can share a tent. His girlfriend is upset because he's not attending and he's not talking to her parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The family's stance might stem from their own values or beliefs, thinking that even though the couple is adults, they want to set a good example for kids. But the author feels it's discriminatory and disrespectful, especially when other couples are allowed to share. \n\nThe girlfriend initially promises that next year they can share, but when it comes time, the family backs out. The author then refuses to attend, which makes the girlfriend upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFrom the author's side, he's standing up for his preferences and feels the family's rule is unfair. He's also trying to communicate his feelings, even if it's causing conflict. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the family's wishes are important, and the author is overreacting or not respecting her family's traditions. \n\nThe author's actions (refusing to attend) could be seen as a way to assert his boundaries, which is valid. However, it might also be seen as not compromising or not respecting the girlfriend's position if she really wants to attend despite the tent issue. \n\nBut considering that the family applied the rule inconsistently (other couples shared tents), the author's frustration is understandable. He's not just being petty; there's a double standard. The problem is more about the family's decision than the author's reaction. However, the way he handles it (not attending and not communicating directly with the family) might be seen as extreme.\n\nBut the girlfriend agreed with him last year, then didn't follow through effectively. The author tried to talk to her parents but she wouldn't let him. So the blame might not be entirely on him. If the family's rules are a deal-breaker for him, it's his right to choose not to attend. The girlfriend's upset reaction might be because she wanted to maintain family relationships, but the author's stance is about his own comfort and respect.\n\nSo I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. He's standing up for his rights in a situation where there's inconsistency. The answer would be B (No).\n"
