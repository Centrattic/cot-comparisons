Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other younger couples are. The author is upset and decides not to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's family's stance might be based on their values or beliefs. The author and girlfriend are 26 and had been dating a year, so they might feel it's reasonable to share a tent. However, the family's rules apply to their own events, and they might have specific reasons, like setting an example for kids or cultural norms.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They felt singled out when others weren't restricted. But the key points are consent and mutual agreement. The girlfriend initially agreed to follow the family's rules, and the author went along. When the family changed their mind again, the author decided not to attend, which the girlfriend didn't want. \n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing their comfort? It depends on perspective. The family's rules are part of their event, so guests might need to respect them. However, the author's feelings of being unfairly treated are valid. The girlfriend's role is tricky too\u2014she might feel torn between her partner and family. \n\nThe author's decision not to attend could be seen as standing up for their boundaries, but it also causes conflict. The girlfriend's upset reaction suggests she values family time and may feel the author isn't respecting her family's wishes. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person's actions crossed a line. The author isn't being violent or disrespectful; they're expressing their feelings and choosing not to attend. The family's rules are strict, but the author's reaction is about personal dignity and fairness. \n\nSo, while there's no clear right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to feel respected, and the situation highlights a clash between family traditions and personal relationships. The answer is likely B (Not the Asshole).\n"
