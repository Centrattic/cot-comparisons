Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples are. The author is frustrated and decided not to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The girlfriend's family has an annual campout. Last year, they weren't allowed to share a tent, but other couples who arrived later (and are younger, dating less time) were. The author found this unfair and felt insulted. The next year, after the parents said they needed to talk to other adults, the decision was made again to not share. The author refused to go, leading to the girlfriend being upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The author's perspective: they feel it's unfair, especially since other couples aren't facing the same restriction. They're an adult couple in a committed relationship, so the family's rules seem hypocritical. The author's frustration is valid because they're being treated differently without a clear reason. Not wanting to attend if the situation isn't resolved is a personal choice, but it affects the girlfriend's family event.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, like family traditions or values, even if they seem inconsistent. The girlfriend agreed with the author's frustration but still wanted to attend, maybe to maintain family harmony. The author's refusal could be seen as disregarding her wishes and the importance of family events, which might upset her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They have a valid point about fairness, but their reaction (refusing to attend) might prioritize their own feelings over the relationship and the girlfriend's family. However, the family's rules are the root cause here. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset, but pushing back is their right. The girlfriend's family's inconsistency is problematic. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not attending if the conditions aren't met. But maybe there was a better way to handle it, like finding a compromise. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's family should have considered the couple's situation, but the author's choice to not attend might be seen as a personal decision, not a wrong one. The key is whether the author's actions were unreasonable. Since the family is enforcing rules that others don't follow, the author's stance is understandable. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
