Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not being allowed to share a tent with his girlfriend at a family campout. The author feels it's unfair because they're both 26, in a year-long relationship, and other couples at the event are allowed to share tents. He's upset, the girlfriend agrees with him, but her parents still decided they can't share a tent again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author's frustration is valid because they're an adult couple, and the rules seem inconsistent. The girlfriend's family is applying double standards by allowing other couples but not them. The author's reaction\u2014being upset and deciding not to go\u2014is a response to feeling disrespected. \n\nThe girlfriend initially supported the author's stance but then her parents overruled it. The author tried to communicate his feelings, which is reasonable. Refusing to attend because of the unfair policy might seem extreme, but given the circumstances, it's a valid choice. The girlfriend being upset might be because she wanted him to attend, but her family's actions are the root issue here.\n\nThe key points are consent, respect, and fairness. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for his relationship's autonomy. The family's rules are intrusive and inconsistent. The author's decision not to attend is his right, and he's not the asshole for prioritizing his comfort and dignity.\n"
