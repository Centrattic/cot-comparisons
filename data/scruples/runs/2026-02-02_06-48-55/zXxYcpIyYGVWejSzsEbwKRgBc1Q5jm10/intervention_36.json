Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author's girlfriend's family\u4e0d\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5e10\u7bf7\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u5e74\u8f7b\u60c5\u4fa3\u53ef\u4ee5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u89c9\u5f97\u88ab\u9488\u5bf9\u4e86\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53bb\u9732\u8425\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5973\u670b\u53cb\u751f\u6c14\u3002\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they're being unfairly treated, especially since other couples are allowed to share tents. They feel it's hypocritical and insulting, leading to them refusing to attend next year. On the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, like family values or trying to set an example for kids, even if it seems inconsistent.\n\nThe girlfriend seems to side with the author initially but then her family changes their mind. The author feels they're being forced to comply, which is frustrating. But the girlfriend is upset because he's not going, which complicates things. \n\nIs the author right to prioritize his feelings over the family's rules? The family might see the tent issue as a boundary they need to maintain, perhaps for cultural or personal reasons. The author might be overreacting, but he's also justified in feeling singled out. However, the key point is whether he's in the wrong by refusing to attend. \n\nIf the family's decision is based on their own values, even if they're inconsistent, the author might not have the right to force them to change their rules. On the flip side, being excluded from an event because of family politics is tough. The author's decision to not go could be seen as a legitimate stand for his relationship, but it also causes conflict with the girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's family's inconsistency (allowing other couples) adds to the author's frustration. However, the author's refusal to attend might be seen as taking a stand, which isn't necessarily wrong. But maybe he should have tried to resolve it more diplomatically. \n\nOverall, it's a tricky situation. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset, but his reaction of not attending might be seen as taking a firm stance, which could be justified. However, the girlfriend's family's stance might be their own choice, and the author's refusal to comply isn't entirely his fault. But maybe he could have handled it differently. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is standing up for his relationship and feeling unfairly treated. The family's inconsistency is a factor, and his reaction is understandable. However, if the family's rules are non-negotiable, there's a case the author is overstepping. But given the situation, B makes sense.\n"
