Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout. The author is the boyfriend, and his girlfriend's family didn't let them share a tent because they thought it would set a bad example for the kids. The boyfriend is upset because other younger couples who came later were allowed to share tents. He eventually refuses to go to the next campout, and the girlfriend is upset with him.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to figure out if his actions are justified or if he's being unreasonable. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the family's reasoning: they don't want their kids to see the couple sharing a tent. The author is 26, his girlfriend is the same, and they've been dating a year. The family might have conservative views on cohabitation or intimacy even in the context of camping. But is that a valid reason? Well, it's their family event, so they have the right to set rules. However, the boyfriend feels it's hypocritical because other couples, who are younger and have been together less time, are allowed to share tents. That's a key point. The inconsistency here might be something to critique about the family's rules.\n\nThe author tried to avoid conflict by going along with the rule last year, but this time he's standing up for himself. He's not just being petty; he's pointing out the double standard. The girlfriend agreed with him initially but then the family changed their stance again. The author's refusal to attend and to talk to her parents is a result of feeling disrespected. \n\nBut maybe he should have found another way to handle it without completely refusing to go. The girlfriend seems to be on his side, but the family's decision is causing a rift. Is the author wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and standing up against what he sees as unfair treatment? Or is he being unreasonable by making a big deal out of it?\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's reaction is based on feeling insulted and not being treated as a legitimate partner. The family's insistence on separation could be perceived as judgmental. However, the girlfriend is upset that he's not going. It's possible she values family bonding and doesn't want him to confront her parents. The author's decision not to go might be hurtful to her, but if the family is being hypocritical and disrespectful, maybe it's justified.\n\nI need to weigh the boyfriend's right to express his feelings and set boundaries against the potential of burning bridges with his girlfriend's family. The family's rules are their own, but if they're being inconsistent and making him feel like a child, that's a problem. The girlfriend's role in mediating is also important. She agreed with him but then the family said no again, perhaps out of pressure from others or a decision to maintain their own standards. The boyfriend is now at a crossroads: attend the event under conditions he finds unacceptable or opt out to maintain his dignity.\n\nIn the end, the author is not being the asshole. The family's rules are restrictive and inconsistent, and the boyfriend is standing up for himself. The girlfriend's upset might be more about not wanting to deal with family conflict than the actual issue of separate tents. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
