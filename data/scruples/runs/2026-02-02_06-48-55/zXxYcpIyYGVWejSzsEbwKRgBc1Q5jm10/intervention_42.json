Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's family doesn't allow the couple to share a tent at a family campout. They're both 26, been dating a year, and the family cites setting a good example for the kids. The author is annoyed but complies, trusting that next year they can share a tent. Then, other couples arrive, younger and less established, and they share tents without any issues. This makes the author furious because they feel singled out.\n\nThe author expresses his frustration after the event, and the girlfriend agrees they were wronged. The next year, even after the author pushes to talk to her parents, they're told again to sleep separately. The author then refuses to go, causing conflict with his girlfriend, who is upset he's not attending.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The family's rules are based on their values, possibly to maintain a family-friendly environment. The author feels it's unfair, especially seeing other couples not face the same restrictions. His refusal to attend might be seen as a reasonable response to feeling disrespected. However, his girlfriend is upset that he's not going, which could imply she values family harmony over his discomfort.\n\nThe author's actions stem from feeling personally insulted and frustrated by inconsistent rules. But is it his responsibility to challenge family norms? Maybe not. However, his decision not to attend is a personal choice, and if he feels it's a matter of respect, he's not entirely wrong. On the other hand, his girlfriend might feel he's overreacting or not respecting her family's wishes.\n\nIn such cases, communication is key. The author tried to address the issue but was met with resistance. The girlfriend's insistence that he go might prioritize family relationships over his feelings. But the author's stance is about mutual respect and fairness. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are a response to feeling marginalized. While his reaction might be intense, the underlying issue is valid. So, I think the answer is B\u2014not in the wrong.\n"
