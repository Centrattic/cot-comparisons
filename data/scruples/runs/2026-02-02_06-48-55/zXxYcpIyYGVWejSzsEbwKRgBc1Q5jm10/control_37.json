Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the girlfriend's family doesn't let the couple share a tent during a family campout. The author is 26, in a one-year relationship. They agreed last year that next time they'd share a tent. But this year, even though other younger couples are sharing tents, the family insists the author and his girlfriend stay separate again. The author is upset, feels singled out, and decides not to go. His girlfriend is upset with him for not going and not talking to her parents.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's look at the key points.\n\n1. **The family's stance**: They have their own rules about tents, possibly based on their values or trying to set an example for kids. But they allowed other couples to share tents this year. That inconsistency might be an issue.\n\n2. **The author's reaction**: He felt personally insulted and frustrated because he was the only one affected. It's his right to feel that way if he's being treated differently without a valid reason. The fact that other couples, some less established, are allowed to share tents adds to the unfairness.\n\n3. **Communication issues**: The author tried to talk to his girlfriend, who then tried to mediate but didn't want the author to confront her parents. The author felt he had to \"harass\" her to bring it up, which suggests poor communication. However, the family's refusal to budge after agreeing last year could be frustrating.\n\n4. **Decision to not attend**: The author decides not to go because he's upset. The girlfriend is upset with him for not attending. The question is whether his decision is justified.\n\nNow, considering the options. If the author is in the wrong (A), maybe because he shouldn't have made the decision unilaterally or not respected the family's rules. But if he's not (B), because the family's rules are inconsistent and unfair, and he's entitled to his feelings.\n\nThe family's rules seem inconsistent\u2014allowing others but not them. The author's reaction is about being treated differently, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's family's actions might be the problem here. The author is standing up for himself, which is understandable. However, maybe he should have communicated better with the girlfriend or found a compromise. But given that the family refused to budge even after prior agreement, his frustration is valid. So probably B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
