Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong here. The situation involves the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples do. The author is upset because they feel it's unfair, especially since they've been together longer and other couples aren't restricted. The girlfriend agreed last year that next year they would share a tent, but this year the family still said no. The author then refuses to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural or family norms. Maybe the family has certain values about privacy or modesty, even if it seems outdated. They might not want their adult children sharing a tent until married. The author's frustration is understandable, but is it the family's right to enforce their values? \n\nThen there's the girlfriend's role. She agreed with the author last year, but this year, her parents changed their mind, and she didn't push as hard as before. She might be caught between her family's wishes and her partner's feelings. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as punishing the girlfriend for her family's decision, which might be unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings of being singled out are valid. The inconsistency with other couples not facing the same rule is a point against the family's approach. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset about being treated differently. However, refusing to attend a family event because of this could strain the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's frustration when the author wants to talk to her parents might stem from not wanting conflict. The author's stance could be seen as not respecting her position, but the family's rules are the root issue. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset, but their refusal to attend without addressing it more constructively might be the issue. The girlfriend's family's rules are their own, but enforcing them selectively causes tension. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the family's rules are inconsistent and the author's reaction is about their right to privacy and fairness. However, there's a middle ground where communication could have been better.\n"
