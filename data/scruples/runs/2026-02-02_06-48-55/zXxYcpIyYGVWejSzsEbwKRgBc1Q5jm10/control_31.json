Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family campout where his girlfriend's family won't let them share a tent, but other couples do. He's upset, feels singled out, and decides not to go. His girlfriend is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The guy's family is making a rule that applies to him and his girlfriend but not others. That seems inconsistent. The author is 26, in a year-long relationship, and the other couples who share tents are younger and less established. The family's reasoning might be about setting an example for kids, but applying it only to him feels unfair. \n\nHe's frustrated because he's been told they'll share a tent next year, but then the family reverses the decision. He's not going, which upsets his girlfriend. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not attending or for being upset about the tent rule.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the family's rule is inconsistent. However, the author's decision to not attend because of this could be seen as a personal choice. But maybe he's overreacting? Or is the family being unreasonable? Also, his girlfriend is caught in the middle, trying to mediate. \n\nThe key points: The family's policy is applied selectively, which is a problem. The author's reaction is about respecting his relationship's autonomy. If the family can't accommodate that, maybe the issue is with the family, not the author. \n\nBut the author is choosing not to attend, which might affect his girlfriend and her family. However, he's standing up for his boundaries. The girlfriend is upset he's not attending, but maybe she didn't support his side enough. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset by an unfair rule. The family's inconsistency is the issue. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
