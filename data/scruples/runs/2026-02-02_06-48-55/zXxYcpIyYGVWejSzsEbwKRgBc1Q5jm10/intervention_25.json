Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent during a family campout, while other couples, including younger ones, do. The author feels insulted and decides not to attend the next year, leading to conflict with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's being treated differently and unfairly. He's in a committed relationship, and not being allowed to share a tent with his girlfriend while others can seems unjust. His frustration is understandable, especially after being promised that next year things would be different. When he's told again to sleep separately, his decision not to attend might be seen as standing up for his boundaries, but it could also come off as being difficult or not respecting his girlfriend's family's wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons. Maybe they have a policy against couples sharing tents, especially if there are kids present. They might want to maintain a certain family dynamic or set an example for the younger generation. The girlfriend's family's stance could be about preserving traditions or making everyone comfortable, especially in a mixed-gender, multi-age group. \n\nThe girlfriend herself is in a tough spot. She agrees with her partner's feelings but still wants to go to the campout, perhaps because it's important to maintain family relationships. Her refusal to let her partner talk to her parents might indicate that she's trying to manage family dynamics, even if she sympathizes with his frustration. \n\nNow, considering the author's actions. Refusing to attend the campout is a significant decision that affects not just him and his girlfriend but also her family. He might be overreacting by choosing to withdraw entirely instead of seeking a compromise. However, if he feels that his relationship's respect is being undermined, it's also valid to set boundaries. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the family's rules are non-negotiable and he's choosing to not attend because he's not getting his way, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the rules are arbitrary or discriminatory, he's standing up for himself. \n\nGiven that the family allowed other couples to share tents, including younger ones, the author's complaint has merit. The inconsistency from the family's side is a key point. However, the author's decision to not go might be seen as a selfish move that disregards his girlfriend's family's wishes and her own efforts to mediate. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction is proportionate. If he's standing up for his rights and the family is being unreasonable, he's not the asshole. But if he's overreacting and not considering family harmony, he might be. The family's inconsistency is a problem, but the author's refusal to attend could be seen as a valid response to being treated unfairly. However, the way he handles it (refusing to talk to her parents) might be where he's in the wrong, as it escalates the conflict rather than resolving it. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the family's rules are inconsistent and unfair, and the author is asserting his boundaries. But there's also a case for A if his refusal to attend is seen as inconsiderate. However, given the family's inconsistency and his justified frustration, B makes more sense.\n"
