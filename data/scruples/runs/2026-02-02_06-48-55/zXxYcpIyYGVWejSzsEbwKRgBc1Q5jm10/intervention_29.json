Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout. The author feels it's unfair because they're both adults and other couples, even younger ones, are allowed to share tents. He got upset and eventually decided not to go, which upset his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The family's perspective: maybe they have their own reasons, like cultural norms or wanting to maintain certain boundaries for the kids. They might see it as inappropriate for a couple to share a tent in a family setting, even if others are doing it. However, the inconsistency here is that other couples are allowed to do it, which the author points out. That inconsistency could be a problem because it seems discriminatory or double standards.\n\nThen there's the author's reaction. He was annoyed but tried to hold it in. When other couples were allowed to share tents, he got furious. He communicated his feelings to his girlfriend, who initially agreed to fix it but then the family still said no. The author then decided not to attend, which upset his girlfriend. \n\nIs it wrong for him to prioritize his comfort and boundaries? If the family is being unreasonable and inconsistent, he might have a right to be upset. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's causing conflict by not attending, maybe he's overreacting. But if the family is enforcing an unfair rule, he's not the one at fault.\n\nThe girlfriend's role is also important. She agreed with him initially but then let the family's decision stand, and when he wanted to talk to her parents, she refused. She's caught between her family and her partner. The author's refusal to attend might be a valid choice if he feels disrespected. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the family's rules are inconsistent. The author isn't the one making the rules; he's reacting to them. If the family is applying a double standard, he's not in the wrong for being upset. But maybe the author should have handled it differently, like trying to talk to the family directly if the girlfriend wouldn't let him. However, the girlfriend didn't want him to talk to them, so he had to follow her lead. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The family's inconsistency and the girlfriend not standing up for their agreement might be the main issues. The author is standing up for his boundaries and feels insulted, which is a valid reaction. So the answer is B (No).\n"
