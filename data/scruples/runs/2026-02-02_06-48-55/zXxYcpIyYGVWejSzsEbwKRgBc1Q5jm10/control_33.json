Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a conflict during a family camping trip where the girlfriend's family doesn't allow the couple to share a tent, while other couples do. The author is upset about this and decides not to attend the next year's campout, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main grievance is being treated differently compared to other couples. They were told last year they'd be allowed to share next year but it didn't happen. The author felt it was unfair and that the family's rules were hypocritical. They communicated their feelings to the girlfriend, and when the situation wasn't resolved, they chose not to attend, which upset the girlfriend.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The family's reasoning could be about setting an example for kids, but the author argues that other couples aren't held to the same standard. The author's reaction is not to confront the family directly but to withhold attending, which the girlfriend objects to. \n\nThe girlfriend's side isn't fully explained, but she agreed with the author's feelings last year. However, this year, her parents made the decision again. The author's refusal to attend might be seen as a personal choice based on their discomfort and perceived unfairness. But does that make them the asshole?\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable. The family's rules might be their own, but the author is within their rights to set a boundary if they feel disrespected. The girlfriend's anger might stem from not wanting conflict with her family or not wanting to lose the camping event. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on respecting both parties' perspectives. The author isn't being aggressive towards the girlfriend's family; they're expressing their feelings and choosing not to participate in an event that makes them uncomfortable. The girlfriend's family's rules could be their cultural or personal choice, but the author's reaction is about their own boundaries. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The girlfriend's upset is valid, but the author isn't the asshole for prioritizing their comfort. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
