Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple's conflict over sharing a tent at a family campout. The girlfriend's family didn't let them share a tent last year, even though other couples who were younger and had been together less time did. The author was annoyed, agreed to do it that time, but got more upset when others were allowed. Now, the family is doing the same thing again, and the author refuses to go, leading to a fight with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author feels wronged because he thinks it's unfair that their relationship isn't respected compared to others. He's in his late 20s, in a committed relationship, and finds it ridiculous not to share a tent. His annoyance is understandable, especially when others aren't treated the same way. But then, he decides not to go to the campout altogether this year, which is a big deal. His girlfriend is upset because he's not willing to go and he wants to talk to her parents, which she's against.\n\nThe girlfriend's family's stance might be based on their values or trying to maintain a family-friendly environment, even if it seems strict. The girlfriend agreed to the tent arrangement last year, and when the author pushes for a discussion this year, she's resistant. Maybe she's trying to keep the peace or respects her family's wishes more than the author anticipated.\n\nThe key points here are the author's refusal to attend the campout, which affects the girlfriend and her family. Is it fair for him to prioritize his feelings over her family's traditions? Also, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014she's very upset, indicating that the author's refusal is causing more harm than the tent issue itself. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable by not attending because of the tent? Or is the family's request unreasonable? The author's actions have consequences: skipping the event might hurt his relationship with the girlfriend and her family. Maybe he should have tried to find a compromise or communicated better. However, the family's double standard (others can share tents but not them) is questionable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's insistence that he go, despite his objections, might not consider his feelings. The author's frustration is valid, but his solution (not attending) might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's standing up for his feelings, but the way he's handling it (refusing to attend) could be seen as selfish. The girlfriend is also in a tough spot, caught between her family and her partner. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the tent issue is a deal-breaker. If the family is being unreasonable, but the author's refusal to attend is causing even more conflict, maybe he's at fault for not trying to resolve it. Alternatively, if the family's rules are unfair, the author isn't entirely wrong. But since the question is whether he is in the wrong, and considering he's causing the girlfriend distress by not attending, maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn. The family's double standard is a problem, but his refusal to attend might be an overreaction. So maybe A.\n"
