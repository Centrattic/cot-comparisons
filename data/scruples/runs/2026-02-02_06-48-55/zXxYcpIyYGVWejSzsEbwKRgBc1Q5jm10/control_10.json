Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about sharing a tent at a family campout. The girlfriend's family didn't allow the author and his girlfriend to share a tent, even though other couples did, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The family's stance might be based on their values or trying to set an example for younger kids. They might feel uncomfortable with an adult couple sharing a tent, especially if there are children around. On the other hand, the author and his girlfriend are both adults, in a committed relationship, and it's reasonable for them to want privacy.\n\nThe author mentions that they tried to go along with it but it was frustrating. When other couples arrived and shared tents without issue, it probably felt hypocritical. The family's inconsistency (applying the rule only to them) adds to the frustration. The author communicated his feelings, and the girlfriend initially agreed it was an issue but then the family imposed the rule again. The author then decides not to attend, leading to conflict.\n\nIs the author wrong for choosing not to attend? He's standing up for his boundaries and the respect he feels he deserves. The family's rules seem inconsistent, and the girlfriend's parents didn't address the hypocrisy. The author isn't being unreasonable here. His decision to not go is a response to being treated differently without a valid reason. The girlfriend's upset might stem from feeling caught between her family and her partner's needs, but the author's actions are about asserting his right to privacy in a situation where the rules don't apply fairly. So, the answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
