Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong (ITA). The situation is about the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout. The author is annoyed because they're the only couple not allowed to do so, even though other younger couples are. The girlfriend agreed with him last year, but this year her family said no again, leading the author to refuse going and causing her to get upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is frustrated because they're being treated differently. They were promised last year that next time they'd share a tent, but her family changed their mind. The fact that other couples aren't restricted might make him feel singled out. On the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own cultural or personal values about privacy, especially around their kids. The author's response was to not attend, which upset the girlfriend.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the family's rules are their own, and the author might not have the right to enforce his preferences on their event. The girlfriend's agreement last year might have been a personal promise, not something her family was committed to. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as holding the family responsible for his personal discomfort, which might not be fair. However, the family's insistence on their rule despite others not following it could be hypocritical or unfair, which the author is reacting to.\n\nThe key points here are the family's authority over their event and the author's right to his feelings. The family can set their own rules, but if they're inconsistent, that's an issue. The author's anger is understandable, but choosing to not attend because of it might be a problem. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she values family time over the tent issue, which might make her feel the author is overreacting. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. He's not wrong for feeling upset, but maybe he's wrong for not attending and making the girlfriend choose between her family and him. The family's stance is their right, but the inconsistency could make the author feel disrespected. The answer likely depends on balancing personal feelings with respect for family traditions.\n"
