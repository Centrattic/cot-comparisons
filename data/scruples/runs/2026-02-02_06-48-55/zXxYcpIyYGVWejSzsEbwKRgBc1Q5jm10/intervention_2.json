Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend not being allowed to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples are. The author's main issue is feeling singled out and insulted, especially since they're a mature couple and others are allowed to do it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family's rules might be based on their values or cultural norms. The author's girlfriend agreed with him last year but the family changed their decision this year. He's upset because he feels it's unfair and is now refusing to attend. He also tried to talk to the family but was blocked by his girlfriend.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, his reaction is understandable, but is it justified? Maybe he's overreacting by not attending and causing tension in the relationship. On the other hand, the family's inconsistency is problematic. They allowed other couples but not them, which is unfair. The girlfriend's refusal to let him talk to her parents adds stress. \n\nThe key points: The author didn't do anything to deserve being treated differently. The family's policy is inconsistent. The girlfriend's actions (not letting him talk, then getting upset when he refuses to go) might be more at fault. The author's refusal to attend could be seen as an overreaction, but the root issue is the family's unfair treatment. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. The family's actions and the girlfriend's handling of the situation contribute to the problem. The author's frustration is valid given the unfairness. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
