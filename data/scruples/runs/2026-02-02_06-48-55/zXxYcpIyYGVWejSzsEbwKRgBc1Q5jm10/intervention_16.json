Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the couple can share a tent at a family camping trip. The girlfriend's family didn't allow it last year, even though there were other couples, younger ones, who did share tents. The author was annoyed but agreed to go along, hoping it would be okay next year. Then this year, the same thing happened again, and the author decided not to go, which upset the girlfriend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they're an adult in a committed relationship, and being forced to sleep separately while others aren't seems unfair. They felt it was personal and insulting, especially since other couples weren't restricted. The girlfriend agreed with them last year and promised it would change, but this year the family still said no. The author's refusal to attend this year might be seen as a stand for their boundaries, but maybe they overreacted by not going at all.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's family might have their own reasons, like cultural norms or wanting to set an example for kids. The girlfriend might be trying to maintain family relationships and not wanting to create conflict. The author's decision to not attend could hurt her and the family, and maybe they didn't handle the situation well by not talking directly to the parents as they were offered to do. The girlfriend's anger might stem from feeling caught between her partner and her family.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to go? They have a right to be upset, but maybe there's a better way to handle it without entirely bailing on the event. Conversely, the family's stance could be unreasonable, but the author's response might be too extreme. The key factors are the fairness of the family's rule, the communication between the couple, and whether the author's actions were proportionate. \n\nSince the author's main issue is being treated differently from others and feeling disrespected, their anger is understandable. However, choosing not to attend might have been a harsh response when other options, like direct communication or compromise, were available. But if the family isn't willing to budge, maybe the author's stance is justified. It's a tricky balance between personal boundaries and respecting family dynamics. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because their feelings are valid, but maybe their reaction could have been handled better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the family's rules are questionable and the author's refusal is about asserting their relationship, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
