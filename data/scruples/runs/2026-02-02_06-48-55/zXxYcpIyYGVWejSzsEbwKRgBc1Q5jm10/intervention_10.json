Last year while at the camp out my girlfriend and I weren\u2019t allowed to share a tent as, apparently her parents/aunts etc thought it would be inapparopriate and set a bad example for the kids.\n\nPersonally I found this stupid as we are both 26 and had been dating for a year at the time, but I go along with it as my girlfriend assured me the next campout we will share a tent. So not sharing a tent is low key pissing me off the whole time (my girlfriend has all the awesome camping gear and Iv got a ground pimple to sleep in lol) because trust me the last thing I want to do is have sex in a camp filled with 20+ of her relatives that I don\u2019t know.\n\nI\u2019m holding my annoyance in and am trying to have a good time but on the second day of the campout, more people arrive. 3 couples to be exact that are friends of her cousins. All of these people are younger than my girlfriend and I and have been together less time than us and immediately proceed to share tents and no one says a word.\n\nAt this point I\u2019m furious, we are the only couple in the entire place who are not sharing tents and we have been together longer than most of the people our age who are sharing tents. I swallow my rage and get through the campout. Afterwards I explain that the whole tent fiasco basically ruined it for me and that if we don\u2019t share a tent next year I don\u2019t want to come because I feel personally insulted that I was the only one to be made to sleep separately from my significant other. My girlfriend whole heartedly agrees with me and says next year we will definitely share a tent.\n\nFast forward a year, I have to harass my girlfriend relentlessly to get her to bring up the topic of us sharing a tent to her parents ( I offered to talk to them myself but she refused). They say they need to talk to the other adults. They come back a week later and tell her we have to be separate again.\n\nAt this point I tell my girlfriend I\u2019m not going and offer to talk to her parents about the issue. She absolutely does not want me to talk to them and insists that I go and that everything will be ok.\n\nI\u2019m still refusing, and she is beyond pissed. Am I the asshole?\n\nTLDR: Girlfriends family insists that her and I do not share a tent, but not anyone else. I\u2019m pissed and don\u2019t want to go. Girlfriend is very upset that I don\u2019t want to go\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend's family not allowing them to share a tent at a family campout, while other couples do. The author is frustrated and finally decides not to go, leading to conflict with the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the family's rule against sharing a tent, which they applied to the author and his girlfriend but not other couples. The author finds this unfair, especially since they've been together longer. His girlfriend agreed with his feelings last year but this year, after negotiations, the family still said no. The author then refuses to attend, leading to the girlfriend being upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the facts.\n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong: Maybe he didn't handle it respectfully. He could have tried to communicate better with the girlfriend's parents as he offered to do, but she stopped him. Also, by not going, he might be overreacting, causing stress on the girlfriend and the family event. The family might have their reasons, even if they seem arbitrary.\n\nArguments for the author not being in the wrong: The family's rule seems inconsistent. Other couples are allowed to share tents, so it's discriminatory. The author's feelings are valid; being forced to sleep separately in a campout with family can be uncomfortable and demeaning. The girlfriend initially supported him but the family didn't follow through, leading to frustration. The author's decision to not attend could be a reasonable response to feeling disrespected.\n\nThe girlfriend's role is also important. She agreed with the author's stance but didn't follow through effectively, and when asked, she didn't let him talk to her parents. That might mean the problem isn't entirely the author's. However, the author's refusal to attend without resolving the issue could be seen as not prioritizing the relationship enough, especially if the girlfriend is upset.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author has valid reasons for his frustration. The family's inconsistency is an issue, and the author's decision not to attend might be a justified boundary. However, the way he handled it (refusing to attend) could have been approached differently. But the main conflict is the family's rules, which are the root of the problem. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
