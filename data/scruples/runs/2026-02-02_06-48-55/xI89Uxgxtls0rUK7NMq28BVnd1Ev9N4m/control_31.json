She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder, and might cause issues during the wedding. The author is worried about her overshadowing the event, either by being stressed, depressed, or using drugs.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they are at fault for excluding their sister. The sister's behavior seems problematic, and the author has valid reasons. They mentioned that the sister's presence could disrupt the wedding, and they want their day to be about them. Family members are pressuring the author to include her because she's their sister, but the author is standing their ground.\n\nOn one hand, family can be important, and weddings often include close relatives. But on the other hand, it's the author's wedding, and they have the right to decide who is part of it. The sister's mental health issues add a layer here. The author is concerned about her potential behavior, which is understandable. The sister's reactions\u2014whining and others lecturing\u2014suggest she's used to getting her way, but the author is resisting that.\n\nI think the key points are the author's right to control their own wedding and the sister's behavior. If the sister's inclusion would lead to her overshadowing or causing problems, the author isn't wrong to exclude her. The answer probably leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own well-being and the event's success over family pressure.\n"
