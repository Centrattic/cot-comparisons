She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting their sister to be in their wedding due to her demanding behavior and mental health issues. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister is described as having bipolar disorder with episodes of mania and depression. She's also portrayed as someone who demands attention and might disrupt the wedding. The author is concerned about the sister overshadowing the event. They mentioned that the sister started whining about not being in the wedding, and other family members are pressuring them to include her because she's their sister.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wedding is their day and they don't want the sister to take over. They also have friends they'd prefer to have as bridesmaids. They've even decided to skip a shower or bachelorette party to avoid possible humiliation by the sister.\n\nNow, considering these points, the key factors here are the sister's mental health, the author's right to make personal decisions about their wedding, and the pressure from family. The sister's mental health is a significant aspect. Bipolar disorder is a serious condition that affects behavior and emotions. However, the author is using this as a reason to exclude her, which might raise ethical questions. But they also mention that the sister's behavior could be detrimental to the wedding.\n\nWeddings are personal events, and the person getting married typically has the final say on who attends and participates. The author is making a choice to protect their own comfort and the integrity of their special day. The sister's potential to overshadow or cause issues is a valid concern, especially if the author has experienced this before.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should be included, especially a sibling. But the author is clear that the sister's presence is harmful and that they have other friends they'd rather include. The sister's mental health status could mean that she might not handle the situation well, leading to possible embarrassment or stress for both the author and the sister.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author is not denying the sister attention in all aspects but is specifically making a choice for their own event. The sister's reaction and the pressure from other family members add to the complexity, but the author has the right to prioritize their own needs.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the author is justified in their decision. They are making a choice to protect their wedding day from potential issues caused by the sister's behavior. The answer is B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
