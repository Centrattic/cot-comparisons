She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister not wanting her sibling to be part of her wedding. The sister in question has bipolar disorder and a history of seeking attention through dramatic behavior. The author is concerned that having her sister as a bridesmaid would lead to problems, either because of the sister's mental health issues or her tendency to draw attention. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's sister is described as someone who demands attention and has mental health challenges. The author is worried about the sister overshadowing the wedding day, which is supposed to be centered around her. She's already decided not to have a shower or bachelorette party because of the sister's potential to cause embarrassment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for excluding her sister. Legally, there's no law that says you have to include family members in your wedding. Weddings are personal events, and the couple has the right to decide who attends and who participates in the ceremony. However, there's the emotional and familial aspect to consider. The sister feels excluded, and other family members are pressuring the author to include her. But the author has valid reasons based on past behavior and mental health concerns.\n\nMental health is a significant factor here. If the sister's behavior during past events has been problematic, it's reasonable for the author to be concerned about her sister's well-being and the impact on the wedding. The author isn't excluding her solely out of spite but due to practical concerns. However, there's also the consideration of how this exclusion might affect the sister. But the author's wedding is her event, and she has the final say on who is included.\n\nFamily dynamics can be complex. The sister's request to be in the wedding might stem from feeling overlooked, but the author's decision is about protecting her own event. It's a balance between family obligations and personal preferences. The author isn't being cruel; she's making a choice that prioritizes her own experience. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to choose her wedding party and event details without family pressure. Her decision is based on legitimate concerns about her sister's behavior and mental health. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
