She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding.\n\nFirst, the sister in question has bipolar disorder and has a history of demanding attention, sometimes through negative behavior. The author is concerned that including her as a bridesmaid would lead to her overshadowing the wedding. They mentioned specific issues like the sister's potential stress, drug use due to mania, or depression on the wedding day. \n\nThe author explains that they're not having bridesmaids specifically to avoid including their sister, but they didn't tell her that. The sister started whining about not being in a wedding before, and other family members pressured the author to include her. The author feels it's unfair to be forced to include someone who might ruin their special day, especially when they have friends they'd prefer to have instead. They also mentioned avoiding showers and bachelorette parties to prevent the sister from embarrassing them.\n\nNow, considering the sister's mental health issues, the author's concerns are valid. Bipolar disorder can lead to unpredictable behavior, especially during manic episodes, which could affect the wedding. The author's decision is partly based on wanting their day to be about them and their partner, which is a common desire. They also have friends they want to include, which shows they're considering other relationships.\n\nHowever, the sister might feel rejected, especially if she has a history of feeling overshadowed. The family pressure adds another layer, but the author is standing up for their own needs. The key points here are the author's right to control their wedding and the sister's mental health affecting the event's atmosphere. \n\nThe author isn't being malicious; they're making a decision based on their mental well-being and the potential for disruption. The sister's demands and past behavior justify the author's caution. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're prioritizing their own comfort and the event's success, especially given the sister's mental health challenges.\n"
