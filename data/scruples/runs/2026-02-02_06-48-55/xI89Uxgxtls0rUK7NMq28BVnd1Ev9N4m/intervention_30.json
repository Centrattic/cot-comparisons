She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, being bipolar, and causing issues. The author is worried about the wedding day being about them and not their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister's behavior is problematic, especially with her mental health issues. The author is making decisions to protect their own well-being and the integrity of their special day. On the other hand, family expectations might pressure the author to include their sister regardless of her behavior. \n\nThe key points are the author's right to control their wedding, the sister's potential to cause disruption, and the family's insistence on including her. The author's reasoning is about personal space and avoiding past patterns of being overshadowed. The sister's side isn't directly stated, but her history is mentioned. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person's actions are reasonable. The author is not being cruel but is setting boundaries. They are not excluding the sister out of malice but to protect their own experience. The sister's behavior, as described, could indeed make the wedding stressful. So, the author's choice seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
