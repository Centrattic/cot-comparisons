Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author mentions that their sister constantly demands attention and has bipolar disorder, which causes her to go through mania and depression. They worry that if the sister is in the wedding, it might become all about her, either because she's stressed, depressed, on medication, etc. The author didn't want bridesmaids specifically because they didn't want the sister in the wedding, but they didn't come out and say that. The sister started whining about wanting to be in the wedding since she's never been in one before. Other family members are pressuring the author to include her. The author feels it's unfair to have their day taken over and wants to exclude the sister for their own comfort, even though it might hurt her feelings.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's right to control their own wedding and the sister's mental health and potential for causing issues. The author is concerned about their sister's behavior affecting the wedding. On one hand, the sister might feel hurt or rejected because she's being excluded. On the other hand, the author is trying to protect their own experience and avoid possible problems. \n\nThe sister's mental health is a factor here. If she needs support and the author is excluding her, maybe there's a lack of empathy. But if the sister's behavior is disruptive and the author is trying to prevent a stressful situation, that's also valid. The author is not being cruel; they're trying to manage their own event. \n\nThe family members are pressuring the author, but ultimately, the wedding is the author's day. They can choose who to include. The sister's feelings are important, but so is the author's well-being. The author has friends they'd rather have as bridesmaids, which gives them other options. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to make decisions about their wedding, especially if there are valid concerns about the sister's behavior. However, maybe they could handle it more sensitively, like explaining the situation to the sister to avoid hurt feelings. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they're prioritizing their own experience and taking reasonable steps to avoid potential issues, the answer is likely B (they are not in the wrong).\n"
