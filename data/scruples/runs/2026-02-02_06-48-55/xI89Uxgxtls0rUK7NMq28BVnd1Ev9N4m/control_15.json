She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the person not wanting their sister to be in their wedding because the sister is demanding attention and has bipolar disorder with mania and depression. The sister is upset because she wants to be a bridesmaid, and other family members are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They mention that the sister demands attention, says outrageous things, and that the author is worried about the sister overshadowing the wedding. The sister has mental health issues, which might affect her behavior during the event. The author is also concerned about the sister's potential behavior due to her conditions, like being stressed, down, or on medications. They don't want the wedding to be about the sister and want to avoid any humiliation.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is being excluded from the wedding, which could hurt her feelings. Family members are saying she should be included because she's a sister. But the author is standing up for their own needs, which is important. Weddings are personal events, and the author has the right to choose who they want in their wedding party. The sister's mental health issues don't necessarily mean she can't be in the wedding, but if her presence would cause problems, the author might have a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the author did mention not wanting the sister in the wedding party but didn't directly tell her, which might be a bit manipulative. They also excluded her from the shower and bachelorette party for fear of humiliation. But if the sister's behavior is genuinely problematic, the author's concerns are understandable. The key here is whether the author's decision is based on valid reasons or just avoiding responsibility towards family. Since the sister has a history of problematic behavior that could affect the author's special day, the author is probably justified in their decision. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
