She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question is described as demanding attention, having bipolar disorder with episodes of mania and depression, and a history of causing problems. The author is concerned that including her in the wedding would lead to issues, so they're choosing not to include her, even though family members and the sister herself are pressuring them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They want their wedding to be about them and their partner, not their sister. They mention that the sister tends to overshadow them and cause problems. The author also mentions that they don't want a shower or bachelorette party because of the sister's potential behavior. It seems like they have valid concerns based on past experiences. People often prioritize their own comfort and the success of their big day, so choosing not to include someone who might cause stress is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has a mental health condition. The author's decision not to include her might be seen as excluding someone in need of support. However, the sister's behavior is also described as self-centered and potentially disruptive. The author is not making a decision based on the sister's illness but on her actions and the potential impact on the wedding. It's important to note that having a mental health condition doesn't mean someone is entitled to a role in another person's event if it's going to be problematic.\n\nFamily members are pressuring the author, but ultimately, the wedding is the author's event. They have the right to decide who is involved. The sister's reaction (whining) and the family's insistence might add pressure, but the author is standing by their choice to protect their day. The author isn't saying they hate their sister, just that they don't want her in their wedding for specific reasons related to her past behavior.\n\nI also think about the social norms around weddings. While family is important, the modern trend is toward personalization, and many people choose to exclude certain family members if it's going to cause conflict. The key is whether the author is being discriminatory or just making a practical decision. Since the sister's behavior is the reason, it's more about avoiding potential issues rather than excluding someone based on a fixed trait like mental illness. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and the event's success, which is reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on legitimate concerns about their sister's past behavior and the potential for disruption. They are not in the wrong for making a choice that protects their personal event from possible negative outcomes.\n"
