She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they are at fault for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. \n\nFirst, the sister is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder with mania and depression, and the author is worried she'll make the wedding about herself. The author mentions that their sister is already causing issues, like whining about not being in the wedding, and other family members are pressuring them to include her.\n\nThe author's main argument is that this is their day, and they don't want their sister to overshadow them. They don't want her as a bridesmaid and are avoiding events like a bachelorette party because of her past behavior. The sister, on the other hand, is seen as wanting to be part of the wedding, perhaps due to feeling excluded.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author has a right to make their wedding about what they want, right? Weddings are personal events, and the person getting married should have the final say on who's involved. However, the sister's mental health is a factor here. The author mentions the sister's mental state could affect the wedding negatively. But is it fair to exclude someone based on potential behavior? Or is it about protecting their own experience?\n\nOn one hand, the author is justified in prioritizing their own comfort and the success of their wedding. They might have valid concerns about the sister's behavior. On the other hand, excluding a sibling, especially if family is pressuring the author to include them, could cause family tensions. But is the author obligated to include their sister just because she's family? Maybe not. The sister's demands and the author's need for control of their day might outweigh the familial obligation.\n\nBut wait, the sister is also described as having mental health issues. Is the author being insensitive by not trying to accommodate her in some way? For example, maybe a different role that doesn't involve being a bridesmaid. However, the author says they don't want her in the wedding at all. If the sister's presence is likely to harm the event, then it's understandable the author wants to avoid that. Mental health issues don't excuse bad behavior, but they might contribute to it. The author is trying to prevent potential problems, which is reasonable.\n\nThe sister is portrayed as the one making demands and causing stress, which could make the author's decision more justified. The author is the one trying to keep the focus on their own day, while the sister is the one potentially causing disruptions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for making decisions to protect their wedding. They have every right to choose who is part of their event, especially when there's a history of problematic behavior from the sister. The pressure from family members and the sister's demands don't necessarily override the author's autonomy in this situation. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
