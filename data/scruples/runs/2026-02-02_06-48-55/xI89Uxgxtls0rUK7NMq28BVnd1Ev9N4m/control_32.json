She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question has a history of demanding attention, has bipolar disorder with episodes of mania and depression, and the author is concerned she'll disrupt the wedding. They mentioned not wanting to include her in the bridal party and avoiding events like the shower to prevent her from embarrassing them. Others in the family are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the person planning the wedding. Weddings are personal events, and the person has the right to choose their guests and participants. The sister's behavior, as described, could indeed cause issues. Mental health is important, but if the sister's actions are disruptive, the author has a valid concern. The sister's mental health issues might contribute to her behavior, but that doesn't mean the author has to include her if it's causing stress. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might be feeling excluded, and family obligations are often emphasized. But the author is standing up for their own needs, which is a key aspect in personal events. The fact that the author is avoiding other events because of the sister's potential behavior supports their decision. \n\nI think the key points here are the author's right to control their event and the sister's past behavior that makes her inclusion problematic. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
