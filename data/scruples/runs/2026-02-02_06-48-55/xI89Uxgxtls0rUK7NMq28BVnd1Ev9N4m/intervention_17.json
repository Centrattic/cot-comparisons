She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question has bipolar disorder and a tendency to seek attention, which the author believes would overshadow the wedding. The author also mentions that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister. The author is considering not having bridesmaids to avoid including the sister and has already said no to a shower or bachelorette party to prevent her sister from causing issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister has a mental health condition, which is mentioned as bipolar disorder. The author is concerned about the sister's behavior during the wedding, citing past issues with mania, depression, and possible substance use. The author's main argument is about wanting their wedding to be about them, not their sister. They also mention that they have friends they want to include instead and are trying to avoid the sister's negative attention-seeking behaviors.\n\nNow, the ethical considerations here are about personal choice versus family obligations. Weddings are personal events, and the person getting married usually has the final say on the details. However, there's also the aspect of family dynamics and mental health. The sister's mental health is a factor here; the author is acknowledging that the sister's behavior is a result of her condition. But the author is also taking steps to protect their own experience.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for excluding their sister. On one hand, the author has the right to decide who is in their wedding party. On the other, there's the potential for family conflict and the sister's feelings. However, the sister's behavior is described as problematic, and the author is proactively avoiding situations where the sister might cause issues.\n\nPossible counterarguments could be that the author should try to include the sister if possible, given their relationship. But given the sister's history and the author's concerns, it's reasonable to prioritize their own comfort and the success of their wedding. The sister's mental health might mean she could handle the situation with support, but the author isn't confident in that. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author is being fair. They are not outright excluding the sister from the entire wedding but from the bridesmaid role. The sister can still attend. The author is also not making the wedding about the sister. The key is the author's right to choose their wedding party without external pressure, especially if the sister's presence would detract from the event.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent and impact. The author's intent is to have their wedding be about them, and the impact is avoiding potential issues caused by the sister. Since the sister's behavior could negatively affect the event, the author's decision is protective. The sister's mental health is a complicating factor, but the author is not refusing to have the sister present entirely, just in a specific role. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here.\n"
