She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and a history of seeking attention, which makes the author worried about her behavior during the event. The sister is upset because she's been excluded, and other family members are pressuring the author to include her. The author also mentions not wanting showers or bachelorette parties because of the sister's potential behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's main concern is their own comfort and the integrity of their wedding day. They feel overshadowed by their sister and are worried about her causing issues due to her mental health issues. On the other hand, the sister feels she's being excluded and is being pushed by family to be part of the wedding, which is a significant family event.\n\nMental health is a sensitive topic here. The sister has bipolar disorder, which can lead to mood swings and impulsive behavior. The author might be justified in worrying about potential negative behaviors. But does that justify excluding her? The sister might feel that the author is treating her unfairly, especially if she's part of the family. However, the author's wedding is a personal event, and they have the right to choose who is involved. \n\nFamily pressure is another aspect. Other family members are pressuring the author to include the sister, which can add stress. The author's decision to exclude the sister to avoid conflict and ensure their own happiness on the wedding day seems reasonable. The sister's reaction is also a factor\u2014complaining about not being in the wedding and potentially causing problems if included. The author is also taking preventive measures, like not having a shower or bachelorette party, which suggests they're trying to avoid situations where the sister might cause issues.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is making a choice to prioritize their own well-being and the success of their wedding. While it might be hurtful to the sister, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a personal choice about their event. The sister's mental health issues don't obligate the author to include her if it causes distress. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
