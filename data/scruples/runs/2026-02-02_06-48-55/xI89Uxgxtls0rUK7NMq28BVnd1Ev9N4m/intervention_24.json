She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The author's sister has a history of demanding attention, has bipolar disorder, and the author is worried she'll overshadow the wedding. The sister is upset and others are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is making a personal choice about their wedding, which is a significant event. They have valid concerns about their sister's behavior and mental health, which could affect the day. The sister's demands and the pressure from family members add to the complexity.\n\nOn one hand, family dynamics can be tough. The author might feel they need to include their sister to avoid family conflict. But on the other hand, the wedding is a personal event, and the author has the right to choose who's involved. The sister's mental health is a factor here\u2014maybe she's struggling, but the author's well-being is also important. The author isn't excluding the sister out of spite but to prevent potential issues on their special day.\n\nHowever, the sister's feelings are hurt, and family members are pushing for inclusion. The author might be seen as being selfish, but considering the sister's history, it's a protective measure. The question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their own needs. In many cases, people are advised to communicate and set boundaries, which the author is doing. They've explained their decision without directly stating the real reason, which could be a point of contention. But the core issue is the author's right to control their own wedding day. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're making a choice to protect their event. The sister's mental health and the author's concerns are legitimate. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
