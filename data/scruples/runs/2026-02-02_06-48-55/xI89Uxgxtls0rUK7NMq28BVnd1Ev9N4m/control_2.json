She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question is described as demanding attention, has bipolar disorder with mood swings, and the author is worried about her causing issues during the wedding. The author mentions that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's main concern is about their own wedding day being overshadowed by their sister's behavior. They have specific reasons related to the sister's mental health and past behavior. On the other hand, family members are pushing for the sister to be included, which the author finds unfair.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, weddings are personal events, and the person getting married typically has the final say in how it's planned. The author is making a choice to prioritize their own comfort and well-being, which is understandable. However, there's a potential conflict with family expectations and the sister's feelings. \n\nThe sister's mental health is a factor here. The author is concerned about her behavior during the wedding, which could be valid if there's a history of such issues. But it's also important to consider if the author is making assumptions about the sister's behavior without current evidence. However, given the sister's past actions and the author's firsthand experience, those concerns might be legitimate.\n\nFamily members lecturing the author to include the sister might be\u51fa\u4e8e good intentions, but they're not the ones experiencing the wedding day. The author's decision to exclude the sister could be seen as self-protective rather than selfish. Still, it's possible that the sister might feel hurt or rejected, which could lead to family tension.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not obligated to include someone in their wedding just because they are family. They are making a personal choice to create a day that's meaningful for them. The fact that they have alternative plans with friends suggests they're making an effort to celebrate with others, which balances the exclusion of the sister.\n\nHowever, it's also worth considering if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could have a private moment with the sister or include her in a less public role. But the author clearly states that not having bridesmaids is specifically to avoid including the sister, so they've made that decision intentionally.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is about their own well-being and the success of their wedding day. Unless there's a breach of etiquette or legal obligation, which there isn't in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to dictate the terms of their own wedding, especially given the specific concerns about their sister's behavior.\n"
