She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and a history of demanding attention. The author is worried that including her would make the wedding about the sister, not them. They also mention the sister's past behavior and how other family members are pressuring them to include her.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the author's reasons. They have valid concerns about their sister's behavior and mental health. The sister's actions might disrupt the wedding, and the author wants their day to be about them. On the other hand, the sister might feel excluded, especially since she's family. But weddings are personal events, and the person getting married should have the final say on who's included. The sister's mental health is a factor here too\u2014her well-being could be affected by not being included. But the author's right to choose their own wedding party is strong. The pressure from family members to include her might be misguided, as it's the author's day. The sister's history of overshadowing the author adds another layer. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own comfort and the integrity of their event. The sister's feelings are important, but the author's right to control their wedding takes precedence here. Answer B.\n"
