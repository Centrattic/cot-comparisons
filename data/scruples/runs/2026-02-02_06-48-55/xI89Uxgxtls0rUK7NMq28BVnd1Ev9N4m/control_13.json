She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting their sister to be in their wedding because the sister is attention-seeking and has bipolar disorder, which might cause problems on the big day.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author doesn't want their sister in the wedding because she's overshadowing others, has mental health issues that could lead to stress or drug use, and the sister is whining about not being included. The author also mentions that other family members are pressuring them to include her, but the author wants the wedding to be about them. They also avoid showers and bachelorette parties to prevent humiliation.\n\nNow, considering the possible angles. On one hand, the sister has a mental health condition, which is a significant factor. Bipolar disorder can affect behavior, and the author is concerned about how it might impact the wedding. However, the sister's behavior is described as demanding and problematic, which might be a result of her mental health. The author's main argument is about personal space and not wanting to be overshadowed, which is a valid concern for the wedding day.\n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics and obligations come into play. The sister is family, and there's a cultural or familial expectation that siblings might be involved in each other's weddings. The author is making a choice that could be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over family tradition. But weddings are personal events, and the author has the right to decide who's involved. The sister's behavior, however, complicates things because her mental health could lead to issues that might affect the wedding's atmosphere.\n\nI should also consider if the author is being fair. The sister is being excluded specifically because of her behavior, which the author perceives as problematic. The author is not saying no to all family but specifically this sister, which might be justified given the context. However, the sister's mental health might require sensitivity. The author's decision could be seen as necessary for their own well-being, but the sister's feelings are also valid. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's decision is reasonable given the sister's behavior versus the family pressure. Since the author is the one whose wedding it is, their autonomy is a key factor. The sister's mental health is a complicating factor, but the author is not necessarily in the wrong if they believe including her would cause problems. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to prioritize their own needs and comfort on their wedding day, especially considering the sister's history of problematic behavior and the potential for her mental health to impact the event. The author is making a personal choice that's about their own well-being, which is valid.\n"
