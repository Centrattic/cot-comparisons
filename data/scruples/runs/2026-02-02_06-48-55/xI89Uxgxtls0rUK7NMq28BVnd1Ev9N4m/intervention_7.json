She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, and a history of seeking attention in negative ways. The author is concerned that including her in the wedding would lead to problems, and they don't want her overshadowing their special day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They mention not wanting their sister to be in the wedding because of past experiences where the sister drew attention through outrageous behavior. They also mention that the sister might be stressed, depressed, or under the influence of medication on the wedding day. The author is prioritizing their own comfort and the integrity of their wedding day. That seems valid because weddings are personal events, and the couple should have control over who's involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has mental health challenges. Bipolar disorder can affect behavior, but it's not an excuse for inappropriate actions. However, the author is making assumptions about how the sister will behave based on past patterns. There's also the aspect of family pressure, where other relatives are pushing for the sister to be included. The sister is also expressing her desire to be part of the wedding, which might indicate she values this role.\n\nNow, considering the sister's mental health, is the author being selfish? Well, the author is making a choice that affects their own happiness and the atmosphere of their wedding. It's important to note that having a mental health condition doesn't automatically mean someone should be excluded from family events. But if the sister's presence has historically caused issues, the author might be justified in their decision to protect the event's success.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might be seen as dismissive. They didn't explicitly tell their sister the real reason for excluding her, instead using a vague excuse about not having bridesmaids. This could be hurtful, especially if the sister is already sensitive due to her mental health. Maybe there's a middle ground where the author can set boundaries while still acknowledging their sister's feelings, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their current stance.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to control their wedding and the sister's mental health. The author isn't forcing the sister to behave a certain way, just not including her in the wedding. While it's possible the sister could handle her emotions better, the author isn't obligated to include her if it causes them stress. On the other hand, the sister's exclusion might exacerbate her mental health issues, but that's a different concern.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look for a balance between personal rights and family obligations. Here, the author's decision is about their own event, so they might not be in the wrong. The sister's mental health is a separate issue that shouldn't automatically override the author's wishes. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
