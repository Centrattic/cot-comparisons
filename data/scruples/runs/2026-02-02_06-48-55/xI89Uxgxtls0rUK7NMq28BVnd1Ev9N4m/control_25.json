She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question has bipolar disorder, demands attention, and the writer is worried she'll overshadow the wedding. They don't want her as a bridesmaid, avoid showers and bachelorette parties to prevent her from ruining those events. Family members are pressuring the author to include her sister, but the author feels it's their day and doesn't want her sister to take the spotlight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has a valid reason related to their mental health and the well-being of their wedding day. The sister has a mental health condition that contributes to her behavior, but the author is making a decision based on their own needs. Family members are pushing to include the sister, but the wedding is the author's event. The author is not excluding the sister maliciously but because of past experiences and anticipated problems.\n\nNow, in terms of AITA, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The author is making a personal choice about their own event, so it's their right to decide who attends or participates. However, there's a social expectation that family members, like sisters, should be included. But if excluding them is necessary for the author's comfort and the success of the event, that's a personal right.\n\nI should also consider if there's any potential for misunderstanding. Maybe the sister's behavior is a result of her mental health, but the author is not being cruel; they're just not allowing her to participate in roles that could cause issues. The author isn't cutting her out completely but avoiding specific events where the sister might cause problems.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because it's their day and they have the right to set boundaries, especially when there's a history of the sister causing issues. The answer should be B (No).\n"
