She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, has bipolar disorder, and the author is worried she'll overshadow the wedding. The author mentioned not wanting a shower or bachelorette party because of the sister's potential behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that the wedding is their day and they don't want their sister to overshadow them. The sister's side is that she's family and should be included. But the author has valid concerns about the sister's behavior and mental health issues. The sister has a history of causing problems, like using drugs during manic episodes or being depressed. The author is trying to protect their event from potential disruptions.\n\nThe sister's mental health is a factor here. Bipolar disorder can affect someone's behavior, but it's not an excuse for negative actions. However, the author is setting boundaries for their own well-being. They're also prioritizing friends over family, which can be a sensitive issue. But the key point is that the author is being honest about their reasons, even if they didn't explicitly state the sister's role initially. They're also considering the sister's past behavior, which others might dismiss as necessary family inclusion.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's important to look at intention and impact. The author's intention is to have a positive experience on their wedding day. The sister's impact, based on her past actions, might be harmful. The author isn't excluding the sister out of spite but to prevent potential issues. However, family expectations can clash with personal boundaries. But the author has the right to decide who's in their wedding without coercion from others. The sister's mental health doesn't obligate the author to include her if it causes them stress. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their own needs and the sister's history. The answer should be B.\n"
