She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder with mania and depression, and the writer is concerned that including her in the wedding would lead to chaos or her overshadowing the event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They clearly state that they don't want their sister in the wedding because of her behavior and mental health issues. They mention that their sister is manipulative, attention-seeking, and that they don't want her to ruin their special day. The author also mentions that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister, which adds to their stress. The author is trying to prioritize their own well-being and the integrity of their wedding day, which is a significant event.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has a mental health condition, which complicates things. Bipolar disorder can affect a person's behavior and stability, so the author's concerns might be valid. However, mental health conditions can also be managed with proper treatment. The sister is also expressing her desire to be part of the wedding, which is a natural sibling desire. The author is using the absence of bridesmaids as a cover for their decision, but they're still making a choice that excludes a family member.\n\nI need to think about the balance between the author's rights to their own wedding and their sister's inclusion. Weddings are personal, and the bride or groom has the final say in who attends and participates. However, excluding a close family member without a clear, non-discriminatory reason can be seen as hurtful, especially if the sister is not causing active harm but is struggling with her mental health.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on past behaviors and potential future issues. But is it fair to exclude someone based on perceived future problems? Also, the sister's mental health might mean she's not in a stable place, but the author isn't offering any support or alternatives to help her be part of the wedding if possible. They're just excluding her to avoid potential issues.\n\nMoreover, the author is taking preemptive action based on their sister's history. While it's understandable to want to avoid a problematic situation, is that a valid reason to exclude someone? The author might be overreacting, but it's their event. On the flip side, the sister's mental health could indeed affect the wedding, making the author's concerns legitimate.\n\nI should consider cultural and family norms. In some cultures, family inclusion is extremely important, and excluding a sibling might be seen as harsh. But in others, personal choice and comfort are prioritized. The author is standing by their choice, which could lead to family conflict, but it's their day.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's decision is justified by their sister's behavior and mental health issues, or if they're being selfish by not trying to include the sister despite her challenges. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their day, but they might be wrong if they're not making any effort to include the sister in a way that's manageable. However, the author states they're not even considering her for a role, which might be reasonable if they believe she can't handle it.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to choose their wedding participants. However, they might be perceived as inconsiderate if they don't offer any alternatives or support to help their sister be part of the event in a way that's manageable. But given the sister's history and the author's concerns, it's a complex situation. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
