She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and a history of drawing attention through demanding behavior, which the author is concerned could disrupt the wedding. The author didn't want bridesmaids, in part because they didn't want their sister involved, but couldn't say that directly. Family members are pressuring them to include the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's mental health is a factor here. Bipolar disorder can lead to episodes of mania or depression, which the author is worried might affect her behavior at the wedding. The author's main concern is that the wedding, which is supposed to be their day, might become about the sister instead, either due to her stress, mood swings, or even substance use. They also mention avoiding showers and bachelorette parties because of the sister's potential to humiliate them.\n\nNow, the ethical question is whether the author is justified in excluding their sister. On one hand, family pressure might argue that the sister deserves a role as part of the family. On the other hand, the author has the right to plan their wedding as they see fit, especially if they have valid concerns about the sister's behavior. The sister's mental health is a sensitive issue here. It's important to note that having a mental health condition doesn't automatically mean someone will cause problems, but the author is making an informed decision based on past experiences.\n\nThe author isn't being cruel by excluding the sister for a specific reason; they're making a choice based on their own comfort and the potential impact on their special day. The sister's desire to be included is understandable, but the author is prioritizing their own well-being. It's also worth considering that the author is not entirely excluding the sister from the wedding, just not giving her a specific role like being a bridesmaid. The author could still include her in the guest list or other ways that don't involve a formal role.\n\nHowever, there's a need to balance family expectations. The author's decision might cause tension within the family, but the person planning the wedding has the final say. The key here is whether the author's reasons are legitimate. Since they have specific concerns based on the sister's history and mental health, it's reasonable for them to make that choice. The sister's mental health should be managed with compassion, but the author isn't being inconsiderate by excluding her from the wedding party if they foresee potential issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision is based on their own needs and the potential for the sister's behavior to overshadow their day. They are not being inconsiderate without cause. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
