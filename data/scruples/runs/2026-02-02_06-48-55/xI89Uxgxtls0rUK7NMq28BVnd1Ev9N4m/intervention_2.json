She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister at their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and a history of demanding attention, causing issues. The author is worried about the sister overshadowing the wedding, maybe even being unwell or using drugs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister's mental health is a factor. If she's had manic or depressive episodes, that could affect her behavior. The author is concerned about the sister's behavior at the event. But on the other hand, the sister is a family member, and the author's parents or other relatives might feel the sister should be included. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their wedding, and they want to avoid the sister causing problems. They mention friends who would be bridesmaids instead, but they're avoiding the sister. The family is pressuring them to include her. The author is also avoiding a bridal shower and bachelorette party to prevent humiliation.\n\nI should think about the ethics here. The author has a right to their own day, but excluding a sibling can be hurtful. However, if the sister's behavior is a real issue, maybe the author is justified. Mental health shouldn't be used as a reason to include someone if they're likely to cause problems. But is it the author's responsibility to accommodate the sister's possible behavior, or is it reasonable to set boundaries?\n\nAlso, the sister is being given a choice. The author didn't force her to come but is structuring the event without her. The sister's reaction of whining and others lecturing the author adds to the conflict. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably. The author is being honest about their reasons, even if they're difficult. The sister's mental health is a sensitive topic, but the author isn't being cruel\u2014just setting boundaries. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid reason to protect their day from potential issues caused by the sister's behavior.\n"
