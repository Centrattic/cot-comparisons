She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't want their sister to be part of their wedding because the sister is perceived as attention-seeking, has bipolar disorder, and the author is worried she'll overshadow the event. The sister is upset and others are pressuring the author to include her. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasons for not wanting the sister include her mental health issues and past behavior. They mention the sister's mania and depression, and the author's fear that she might act out during the wedding. The sister is upset and other family members are pushing for her inclusion. The author is also avoiding showers and bachelorette parties to prevent humiliation by the sister.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is justified. On one hand, the wedding is a personal event, and the author has the right to choose guests and roles. They should feel comfortable on their big day. On the other hand, excluding a sibling could be seen as harsh, especially if the sister is struggling with mental health and the author is not seeking to support her.\n\nBut the sister's behavior is described as problematic. The author mentions she demands attention and has outbursts. If the author has valid concerns about the sister's conduct affecting the wedding, it's reasonable to make decisions to protect their own well-being. The sister's mental health might contribute to her behavior, but the author isn't responsible for managing her mental health on their day. The author is making choices to ensure their day isn't ruined by someone else's issues.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction\u2014whining and others pressuring the author\u2014suggests that there's a history of the sister being difficult. The author's reasons are self-protective, which is a legitimate concern. However, it's possible the sister might feel excluded and hurt, but the author's right to their own event takes precedence.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on the person's actions and their justification. Here, the author isn't being malicious but is prioritizing their own needs. The sister's behavior is a factor, not an excuse. So the author isn't in the wrong for making the choice that's necessary for their peace of mind.\n"
