She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes, and the author is worried about their wedding day being overshadowed. The sister is upset and other family members are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They clearly state that the wedding is their day and they don't want their sister to take attention away from them. The sister's behavior is described as problematic, and the author is concerned about her potential actions during the event. The author also mentions not wanting a shower or bachelorette party because of the sister's tendency to humiliate them. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister is likely feeling excluded, especially since she's a family member. However, the author is making a choice that prioritizes their own well-being and the significance of the day. Family members, including siblings, don't have an automatic right to be part of the wedding. The author is within their rights to choose their wedding party. \n\nThe sister's mental health issues might complicate things. The author is worried about her behavior during the wedding, which is a valid concern. The author isn't being cruel by excluding her, but rather making a decision based on past experiences and their own needs. Family pressure is a factor, but the decision ultimately rests with the person getting married. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they are making a personal choice about their own wedding. The answer should be B (No).\n"
