She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention and has bipolar disorder with episodes of mania and depression. The author is concerned that including her in the wedding would lead to her overshadowing the event, either by being stressed, depressed, or using drugs. They also mention family pressure to include her as a bridesmaid and their preference to have friends instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is making a personal choice about their wedding, which is a significant and personal event. They have valid reasons based on their sister's behavior and mental health issues. On one hand, family members are pressuring them to include their sister, which is a common societal expectation. However, the author feels that this inclusion would negatively impact their day, especially given their sister's history of causing problems in the past.\n\nThe sister's mental health is a factor here. Bipolar disorder can lead to unpredictable behavior, which the author is likely aware of. However, it's important to note that mental health conditions aren't an excuse for bad behavior, but they do require understanding and support. The author is not necessarily being cruel by excluding their sister if they've experienced consistent issues. That said, the sister's feelings and the family's expectations are also valid. The author might be seen as prioritizing their own comfort over their sister's desire to participate, which could be a point of contention.\n\nAnother angle is the author's mention of friends instead. Weddings are personal, and the choice of attendants is typically up to the bride. The author has the right to choose who they want to honor them. The sister's entitlement to being a bridesmaid might be questioned, especially if the author feels it's at the expense of their own well-being. However, the family's pressure adds another layer. The author might feel they're being forced to include someone they don't want, which is a common AITA scenario.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems they're making a personal decision based on their experiences with their sister. They're not being malicious but are prioritizing their own needs for a significant life event. The sister's mental health issues might require support, but the author is not obligated to include her in the wedding if it causes them distress. The sister's reaction (whining) might indicate a lack of sensitivity, which supports the author's position. However, there's a potential for the author to be seen as heartless, but given the context, it's a reasonable choice. The answer is likely B (No), but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. For example, if the sister is in a stable phase and the author's exclusion is based on past issues, it's still their right to decide. So, I think the correct choice is B.\n"
