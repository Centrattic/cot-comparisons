She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, has bipolar disorder, and the author is worried about her overshadowing the event. The author made up an excuse about not having bridesmaids to avoid including her. Family members are pressuring them to include the sister. The author feels it's their day and doesn't want the sister to make it about herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's mental health. Bipolar disorder is a real condition that can affect behavior, especially during manic or depressive episodes. The author is concerned about how she might act, which could be valid if the sister has a history of such behavior. However, not inviting someone because of potential issues might be seen as prejudicial, even if based on past behavior.\n\nThe author's reasons for excluding the sister are valid because it's their wedding. People have the right to choose who they want at their wedding. However, the sister's feelings and the family's expectations are being ignored here. The author's excuse about not having bridesmaids might be seen as a way to avoid conflict, but it's also a lie that could hurt the sister.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's behavior of seeking attention and potentially causing drama is problematic. The author's desire to prevent that is understandable. The pressure from other family members to include her adds another layer of stress.\n\nI think the key points are the author's right to control their wedding and the sister's mental health. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and the event's success. However, the sister might feel excluded, but that's a different issue. The author isn't in the wrong for making this choice based on their circumstances.\n"
