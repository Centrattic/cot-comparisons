She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister has mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, and a history of seeking attention through extreme behavior. The author is worried that including her in the wedding would lead to problems, either due to stress, depression, or substance use. They also mention not wanting a shower or bachelorette party because of past humiliation by the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister's mental health is a significant factor. People with bipolar disorder can have episodes, and the stress of a wedding might exacerbate her condition. The author is making a decision to protect their well-being on an important day. \n\nHowever, the sister is being excluded from the wedding, which is a family event. Family members are pressuring the author to include her, which adds another layer. The author is prioritizing their own comfort and the success of their wedding over the sister's desires. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wedding is the author's event. They should have the right to choose who attends and who participates. The sister's behavior has been problematic in the past, and the author is taking steps to prevent potential issues. On the other hand, excluding a family member could be seen as harsh, especially if the sister is vulnerable due to her mental health. \n\nBut the author is not excluding her without cause. There's a documented pattern of behavior that could disrupt the wedding. The author is also trying to create a positive environment for their friends and spouse. The key here is the author's right to make decisions for their own event versus the sister's right to family inclusion. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They are acting in their own best interest and considering the potential negative outcomes. The sister's mental health is a complicating factor, but the author is not being cruel; they're making a practical decision. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
