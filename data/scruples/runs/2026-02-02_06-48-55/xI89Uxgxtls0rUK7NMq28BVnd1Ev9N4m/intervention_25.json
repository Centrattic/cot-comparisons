She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nThe author mentions their sister is bipolar and has a history of seeking attention through dramatic behavior. They're worried she'll overshadow the wedding, causing stress or embarrassment. They didn't want her as a bridesmaid and mentioned not having a shower or bachelorette party to avoid her interference. Family members are pressuring them to include the sister, but the author feels it's their day and should be about them.\n\nFirst, I should consider the sister's mental health. If she's bipolar, her behavior might be due to her condition. However, the author has valid concerns about her actions in the past. Weddings are personal events, and the couple should have control over who's part of their ceremony. The sister's actions of making the event about herself could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's mental health issues might influence her behavior, and excluding her could be seen as harsh if there's a possibility of her managing her condition. But the author is making a choice to protect their own experience. Family pressure is also a factor here\u2014others are pushing for her inclusion, but the author is standing their ground.\n\nI need to balance the sister's needs and the author's right to their own celebration. The key points are the sister's past behavior, her mental health, the author's valid fears about the wedding being overshadowed, and the fact that the author is making a personal choice. The author isn't being unkind but is prioritizing their own well-being. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
