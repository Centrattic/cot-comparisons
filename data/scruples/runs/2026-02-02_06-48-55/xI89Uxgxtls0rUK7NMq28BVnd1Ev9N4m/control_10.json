She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder, is demanding attention, and the author is worried she'll overshadow the wedding. They mentioned that the sister is manipulative, maybe even using negative attention-seeking behaviors. The author doesn't want a shower or bachelorette party because of potential humiliation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's mental health issues are real, but does that automatically mean the author is wrong to exclude her? The author is making a personal choice about their own day. On the other hand, the sister's behavior sounds challenging, and the author is prioritizing their well-being.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person is being unreasonable. The author is clear that the wedding is their day, and they don't want their sister to overshadow it. The sister's demands and the family lecturing the author about including her might be adding pressure. The author has valid reasons based on past experiences with the sister's behavior. \n\nI should also think about the sister's perspective. If she's excluded, she might feel hurt, but the author's autonomy in their wedding is a strong point. The author is not being cruel; they're setting boundaries to protect their day. The sister's mental health doesn't obligate the author to include her if it's a source of stress. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say family should be included, but the author is making a choice for their own well-being. The author isn't excluding the sister from the entire event, just not giving her a specific role like a bridesmaid. That's a reasonable decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to curate their wedding as they see fit, especially given the sister's history of problematic behavior.\n"
