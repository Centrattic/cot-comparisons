She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and a history of seeking attention, sometimes in problematic ways. The author is worried that including her sister would make the wedding about her instead of the author. They've already decided not to have bridesmaids to avoid this, and other family members are pressuring them to include the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's mental health. Bipolar disorder can lead to mood swings, which might affect her behavior. However, the author is concerned about past behaviors where the sister might cause issues. The sister's actions are described as demanding attention, which the author finds overwhelming. \n\nThe user's main point is about their own wedding being their day, and they want it to not be overshadowed. They mention not wanting a shower or bachelorette party to avoid humiliation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for excluding their sister. \n\nLegally, the author has the right to choose their wedding party. Emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. Family dynamics can be tough. The sister might feel excluded, especially if she's been told she should be in the wedding. However, the author's mental health and comfort on their wedding day are also important. \n\nThe sister's mental health is a factor. If she's in a manic episode, she might not act appropriately. The author's decision could be a protective measure for themselves. On the other hand, excluding a sibling could be hurtful, but the author has a valid reason based on past behavior.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the key is balance between personal boundaries and family obligations. Since the author is prioritizing their own well-being and has specific concerns about the sister's behavior, it's reasonable. The sister's actions are described as problematic, so the author isn't the asshole for setting boundaries. \n\nAnswer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
