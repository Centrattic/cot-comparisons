She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding.\n\nFirst, the sister in question has a history of demanding attention and has bipolar disorder, which affects her behavior. The author is concerned that her inclusion in the wedding will overshadow the event due to her past behavior. The author mentions that they have already made decisions to exclude her, like not having bridesmaids, and anticipate her causing issues in other events like a shower or bachelorette party.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wedding should be about them, not their sister. They feel it's unfair to be forced to include her when it makes them uncomfortable. Other family members are pressuring them to include her, but the author is firm in their stance.\n\nNow, considering the sister's mental health, there's a balance between personal boundaries and family obligations. While the sister's behavior is problematic, the author has the right to prioritize their own comfort and the integrity of their special day. Weddings are personal events, and the bride should have the final say in who is included. However, excluding a sibling might be seen as harsh, especially if there's a family expectation. But given the sister's history of causing issues and the author's valid concerns, it's understandable why they want to avoid potential stress and disruption.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to control their wedding details and the sister's history of behavior. The author isn't being cruel; they're setting boundaries for their own well-being. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
