She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The person is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes, and the author is worried about her behavior during the wedding. The author didn't want to have her as a bridesmaid and instead chose not to have bridesmaids specifically because of that. Family members are pressuring the author to include the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. Weddings are a big deal and it's supposed to be a happy day for the couple. If the sister has a history of causing problems, like being on medications, acting out, or overshadowing others, the author might be justified in wanting to avoid that. The author mentions not wanting a shower or bachelorette party because of the sister's potential behavior, which seems like a valid concern for their comfort and the event's atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's side is important too. She might feel excluded, especially if other family members are pushing for her inclusion. The author's sister has a mental health condition, which might affect her behavior, but that doesn't mean she should be forced into a role if it's going to cause more harm. The author's decision could be seen as prioritizing their own well-being and the success of their wedding over family pressure.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister's presence is likely to cause distress or disrupt the wedding, then the author's decision makes sense. However, if the author is being overly controlling or not making accommodations (like having a role that's less stressful for the sister), that could be a point against them. But given the sister's history and the author's specific concerns, it seems like a reasonable choice to protect their special day. So, I think the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
