She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister not wanting her sister to be in her wedding because of the sister's behavior and mental health issues. \n\nFirst, the sister in question has a history of demanding attention, being bipolar with mania and depression, and the author is worried about her causing disruptions. The author also mentions that if they don't include her, the sister might act out, and other family members are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nThe author is choosing not to include her sister in the wedding, not just because of the sister's presence but because of the potential negative impact on the day. Weddings are personal events, and the person getting married usually has the final say on who's included. However, the sister's mental health is a factor here. The author's reasoning is that the sister's behavior could overshadow the wedding, which is the author's special day.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The sister has a mental health condition (bipolar disorder), which might contribute to her behavior. The author is using this as a reason to exclude her, but is that fair or justified? On one hand, the author has the right to control their wedding. On the other hand, excluding a sister could be seen as cutting them off based on their condition, which might be considered unfair unless there's a legitimate risk.\n\nThe sister is also being manipulative or whiny, trying to get attention. The author is standing their ground, but maybe they should consider if there's a way to include the sister without causing problems. However, the author is clear that they don't want the sister there at all, not just because of the sister's behavior but because of past experiences. \n\nMental health conditions don't justify hurtful behavior, but the sister's actions (like using the wedding to get attention) are part of her disorder. The author's decision is about protecting their own day from potential chaos. Since the wedding is a personal event, the author's right to exclude someone who might cause issues is valid. However, if the sister's behavior is part of her mental illness, the author might be penalizing her for something beyond her control. But the author isn't excluding her just for having the condition, but for the behavior that stems from it.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is making a choice that affects their own event. While the sister might feel hurt, the author isn't obligated to include her if they believe it would negatively impact their day. The key here is the author's right to control their wedding. Other family members pressuring them to include the sister might be adding to the stress, but the author is standing up for their preferences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own needs and the success of their wedding over family expectations. Even though it's a tough call, the decision to exclude someone who could cause distress on an important day seems justifiable. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
