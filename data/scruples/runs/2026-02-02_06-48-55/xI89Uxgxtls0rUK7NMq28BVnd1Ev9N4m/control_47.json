She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder, and the author is worried she'll overshadow the wedding. The author didn't explicitly say they don't want her but made it so she's not in the bridal party. Other family members are pressuring them to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasons are personal and about their comfort on their special day. Weddings are personal events, and the person getting married should have control over who is in their wedding party. The sister's behavior is problematic, especially with her mental health issues. However, the author didn't directly tell her they're not in the wedding, which might be a point of contention. \n\nBut wait, the author did imply it by not having bridesmaids, so the sister whined about it. The author also has friends they want to include instead. The sister's potential to cause chaos is a valid concern. Mental health issues shouldn't be used as an excuse for harmful behavior, but the author isn't excluding her based on her diagnosis. They're excluding her to prevent her from taking over the event. \n\nFamily pressure is trying to force inclusion, but the wedding is the author's day. The answer hinges on whether the author's decision is reasonable given the sister's history. Since the sister's behavior is disruptive and the author is prioritizing their own well-being, it's likely they're not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
