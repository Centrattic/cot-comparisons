She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their sister at their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and a history of demanding attention, which causes stress. The author didn't want her as a bridesmaid, partly because they don't want to include her. The sister is upset, and family members are pressuring them to include her.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons are about their own comfort and avoiding potential chaos. Weddings are personal, and the person wants to avoid the stress of dealing with their sister's possible behavior. The sister's mental health is a factor here, but the author is making a choice based on their experience with her behavior. \n\nFamily members are pushing for inclusion, but the author is the one whose day it is. They have the right to decide who's involved. The sister might feel hurt, but the author isn't being cruel\u2014they're setting boundaries. The answer is B, they're not in the wrong. It's their day to prioritize.\n"
