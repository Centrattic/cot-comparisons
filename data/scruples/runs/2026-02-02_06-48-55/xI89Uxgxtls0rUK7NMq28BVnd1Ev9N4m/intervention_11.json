She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and a history of demanding attention, which the author is worried will overshadow the wedding. The author has friends they want as bridesmaids instead. Family members are pressuring them to include the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's mental health is a factor here. Bipolarity can cause mood swings, mania, depression, and impulsive behavior. The author is concerned that her behavior might disrupt the wedding. But is it fair to exclude someone because of their mental health condition? On the other hand, the wedding is a personal event where the bride might want control over who's involved. \n\nThe author is specific about not wanting the sister for personal reasons, like being overshadowed. But they mention not wanting a shower or bachelorette party to avoid the sister, which seems like a direct response to her behavior. Other family members are pressuring the author to include her, which adds to the conflict. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to include a relative in a wedding. However, ethically, there's a balance between protecting one's own day and considering family dynamics. The sister's behavior is problematic, but is exclusion the right approach? Maybe the author could have communicated their decision more compassionately. But the author's main point is about their own comfort and the wedding being their day. \n\nMental health should be treated with sensitivity. The sister might not be aware of how her actions affect others, especially if she's in a manic or depressive episode. However, the author's decision is based on self-preservation. The question is whether excluding someone based on anticipated behavior (even if justified) is wrong. \n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, people often support the decision to set boundaries, especially when there's a history of problematic behavior. The key is whether the author is being fair or if they're overreacting. Since the sister's actions are described as constant and disruptive, the author's choice to protect their event might be justified. \n\nBut I should also consider if there's a middle ground. Could the author have included the sister in a smaller role that doesn't involve a prominent position as a bridesmaid? That might have been a compromise. However, the author explicitly states they don't want her in the wedding at all. \n\nOverall, while the author's approach might be harsh, the underlying reasons\u2014mental health concerns and personal boundaries\u2014could make their decision understandable. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
