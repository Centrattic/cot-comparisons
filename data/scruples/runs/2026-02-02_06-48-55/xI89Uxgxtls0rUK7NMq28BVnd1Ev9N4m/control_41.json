She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder, demands attention, and the author is concerned about her behavior during the wedding. They mentioned that the sister might overshadow the event or act out due to her mental health issues. The author is avoiding having her as a bridesmaid and other events like the shower.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a mental health condition, which is bipolar disorder. The author is worried about her behavior and being overshadowed. They also mention that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister. The author's reasons are based on their sister's past behavior and the potential for the wedding to become about her instead of the author. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, excluding a family member, even a sister, might be seen as harsh. However, the author is prioritizing their own well-being and the integrity of their special day. The sister's behavior, as described, is problematic and could disrupt the event. Mental health issues shouldn't be used as an excuse for harmful behavior, but the author is also not responsible for managing their sister's actions on their wedding day. \n\nThe author is making a personal choice about their event. They are not being cruel, but they are setting boundaries. The sister's reactions and demands are self-centered, and the author is standing up for their needs. Other family members might think the author should include the sister, but the author's primary concern is their own experience. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should make accommodations for the sister's mental health, like assigning her a role that suits her better or providing support. But the author is not excluding her entirely; they're just not having her as a bridesmaid. However, the sister is demanding attention, and the author is trying to avoid that. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often supports people who set boundaries to protect their mental health, especially in cases where there's a history of negative behavior. The author is being proactive about a stressful situation, which is understandable. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
