She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, being bipolar with mania and depression, and the author is concerned about her causing issues during the wedding. The sister is upset and other family members are pressuring the author to include her. The author also mentions not wanting a shower or bachelorette party to avoid humiliation by the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has valid reasons: the sister's mental health issues could affect the wedding, and the author wants their day to be about them. The sister's behavior is described as demanding and problematic, and the author is clear about not wanting her there. However, family dynamics can be complex. The sister is family, and there might be cultural or familial expectations to include siblings in a wedding. But the author is also setting boundaries for their own well-being, which is important. \n\nI should also think about the aspect of the sister's mental health. If the sister is in a manic or depressive episode, it could make the wedding stressful. The author is prioritizing their own mental health by excluding someone who consistently causes issues. On the other hand, the sister might feel excluded, but the author isn't being cruel; they're just avoiding a role that would lead to conflict. \n\nThe family members pressuring the author might be projecting their own expectations, but the wedding is the author's to plan. The fact that the author has friends they want to include instead suggests they have a support system. The sister's reaction (whining) might be part of her usual behavior, and the author is standing their ground. \n\nI think the author is justified in not wanting to include a sister who has a history of making things about herself and potentially causing problems. They have the right to choose who is part of their wedding, especially when it's their personal well-being at stake. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
