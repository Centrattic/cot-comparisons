She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question has bipolar disorder and a history of seeking attention, sometimes through negative behavior. The author is concerned that including her in the wedding would lead to her overshadowing the event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's mental health is a factor\u2014she's bipolar, which can cause mood swings and impulsive behavior. The author has specific concerns about her acting out, whether due to stress, depression, or substance use. They also mention that the sister has already reacted negatively by \"whining\" and that other family members are pressuring them to include her. The author is prioritizing their own comfort and the integrity of their special day over family obligations.\n\nFrom a personal rights perspective, weddings are typically the couple's day, and they usually have the final say in who attends and what roles people have. The sister's mental health issues don't automatically give her a right to a role if it causes distress. However, there's a social expectation to include family, so the author might feel pressured. They're balancing their need for a positive experience against family dynamics.\n\nThe sister's behavior is problematic, and the author's reasons are valid. They're protecting themselves from potential humiliation and stress. The fact that they\u2019re not inviting her as a bridesmaid but have friends they\u2019d prefer instead shows they\u2019re making a deliberate choice, not just excluding her out of spite. The family's pressure adds another layer, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own well-being.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say it's cruel to exclude a sibling, but the sister's actions have historically made things difficult. The author's mental health and the wedding's atmosphere matter. Since the sister has mental health issues, the author might also consider if there's a way to involve her without causing problems, but given the sister's past behavior, that might not be feasible.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for making personal choices about their wedding, especially when it's to protect themselves from a known problematic situation. So the answer should be B.\n"
