She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes, and the author is worried she'll overshadow the wedding. They mentioned not wanting to include her as a bridesmaid, even though they didn't explicitly say that's why they're not having bridesmaids. Family members are pressuring the author to include her. The author is also avoiding showers and bachelorette parties because they fear the sister will humiliate them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the person planning the wedding. Weddings are personal, and the couple should have the final say in who attends or participates. The author is clearly stating that their wedding is about them, and they have valid concerns about their sister's behavior due to her mental health issues. However, I should also think about the sister's perspective. She might feel excluded, especially given her mental health struggles. But the author has a right to prioritize their own comfort and the success of their wedding day. The sister's demands could be seen as self-centered, especially if she's using her mental health as an excuse to get attention. However, the author's decision isn't necessarily about punishing her but about protecting their own event. Family obligations can be tricky, but the author's reasons seem justified. They are making a choice that affects their own day, so I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
