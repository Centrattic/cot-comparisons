She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder with mania and depression, and the author is concerned she'll cause problems. They mentioned the sister demands attention, says outrageous things, and the author doesn't want her overshadowing the wedding. The author also wants to avoid a shower or bachelorette party because of the sister's potential behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's mental health. Bipolar disorder is a legitimate medical condition, and while the sister's behavior might be problematic, it's not entirely her fault. However, the author is making a personal choice about their wedding, which is a significant event. The question is whether excluding a family member is wrong, especially when there's a valid concern about her behavior affecting the event.\n\nThe author's reasons are based on past experiences and anticipated issues. They don't want their special day ruined by the sister's possible actions. On the other hand, the sister might feel excluded or hurt. But the wedding is the author's event, and they should have autonomy over who's included. The other family members pushing to include the sister might not understand the personal dynamics.\n\nI need to weigh the sister's mental health against the author's right to control their wedding. While the sister's needs are important, the author's well-being on their wedding day is also crucial. The author isn't being unkind; they're making a decision to protect their event from potential stress. The sister's behavior is a factor here, and the author has the right to set boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own needs and the integrity of their wedding day, which is a personal choice they're entitled to make. The answer is B.\n"
