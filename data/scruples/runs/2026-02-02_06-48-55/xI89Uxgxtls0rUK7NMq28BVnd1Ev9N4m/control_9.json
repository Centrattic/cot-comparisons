She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting their sister at their wedding. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of demanding attention and has bipolar disorder. The author is worried that if the sister is at the wedding, it might become about the sister instead of them. The sister hasn't been a bridesmaid before and is upset about not being included. Other family members are pressuring the author to include her because she's their sister. The author is choosing friends instead and avoiding showers or bachelorette events to prevent possible humiliation.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the sister's mental health issues and the author's desire to have control over their wedding day. The sister's behavior could potentially disrupt the event. But is it fair for the author to exclude her just because of that? On one hand, the wedding is a personal event, and the author should have the right to choose who attends. On the other hand, family dynamics can be tricky, especially with siblings. The sister might feel excluded, but the author is prioritizing their own comfort and the success of their wedding.\n\nAlso, the sister's bipolar disorder might mean she's not in control of her actions, which could lead to issues. The author is aware of this and is trying to prevent a possible problem. However, the sister is still a family member, and there might be expectations of including her. The author's reasons are based on both personal preference and concerns about the sister's behavior. \n\nI think the author is justified in making this choice. It's their day, and they have the right to set boundaries, especially if there's a history of issues. The sister's needs might not align with the author's vision for the wedding. So the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
