She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the person is at fault for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and a history of seeking attention, which the author is worried will overshadow their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has mental health issues (bipolar) and a tendency to demand attention. The author is concerned that including her in the wedding would lead to problems, like the sister being stressed, drugged, or making the day about herself. The author has already made decisions to exclude her, like not having bridesmaids, and is facing pressure from family and others to include her. They also mention avoiding showers and bachelorette parties because of the sister's past behavior.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong for this decision. On one hand, the sister is a family member, and there might be expectations to include her. But on the other hand, the wedding is a significant personal event, and the author has valid concerns about the sister's behavior affecting the day. The sister's mental health could be a factor here. If the sister is unwell, maybe there's a possibility she could be managed with support, but if she's been problematic in the past, the author might have a legitimate reason to exclude her.\n\nI should also think about the dynamics. The author is trying to prevent their sister from overshadowing the wedding, which is their day. The sister's actions in the past (humiliating the author, needing attention) are cited as reasons. The author isn't excluding the sister out of spite but because of practical concerns.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is being fair. The sister is being excluded, but maybe there's a way to include her in a different role that doesn't involve as much visibility. However, the author specifically mentions not wanting her in any role, which is a strong stance. But given the sister's history, maybe the author is justified in protecting their own event.\n\nAlso, the pressure from family members is mentioned, but the author is asserting their right to make the wedding their own. There's a balance between respecting family and personal autonomy. Mental health issues shouldn't be used as a weapon, but if the sister's presence would genuinely harm the event, the author's decision is understandable.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whether the author is acting unkindly or if they have valid reasons. Since the author is making a choice based on past experiences and mental health concerns, rather than just personal dislike, it's more of a protective measure. So the answer would likely be B (No), meaning the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
