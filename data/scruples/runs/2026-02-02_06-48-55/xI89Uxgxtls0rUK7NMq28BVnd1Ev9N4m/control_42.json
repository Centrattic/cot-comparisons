She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder, is demanding attention, and the author is concerned she'll overshadow the wedding. They don't want her as a bridesmaid, but other family members are pressuring them to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's sister has mental health issues, which might affect her behavior. The author is worried about the sister causing problems during the wedding. They're also facing pressure from family to include her. The author is prioritizing their own comfort and the event being about them, which is understandable.\n\nBut is it wrong not to include a sibling in a wedding? Weddings are personal, and the couple usually has the final say. The sister's behavior, as described, could indeed be disruptive. The author's reasons are based on past experiences and mental health concerns. However, excluding a family member can cause family tensions. The author is not being selfish if their reasons are valid and they're protecting their well-being. On the other hand, maybe they should try to find a compromise, like a different role for the sister that doesn't involve being a bridesmaid. But the author has valid concerns about the sister's potential behavior. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
