She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's right to exclude a sister from one's wedding because of her behavior and mental health issues.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their sister constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes, and that including her in the wedding could lead to problems. They don't want bridesmaids specifically because they don't want her involved, but they didn't say that directly. The sister is upset and other family members are pressuring the author to include her. The author also decides against a shower or bachelorette party to avoid potential humiliation by the sister.\n\nSo, considering the sister's mental health, the author is trying to protect their own well-being. It's their wedding day, and they have the right to make it personal and comfortable for themselves. However, excluding a sibling might be seen as harsh, especially if there's a cultural or family expectation to include them. But the sister's behavior history with attention-seeking and causing stress might justify the author's decision. The key point is the author's right to prioritize their day without others causing disruption. Since the sister has a history of problematic behavior, the author isn't necessarily showing malice but protecting their event. Also, the author is honest about their reasons indirectly (not wanting a bridal party). So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong, hence B.\n"
