She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a sister who constantly demands attention and is bipolar with manic and depressive episodes. The sister is being pushy about being in the wedding. The author doesn't want her there because they don't want her to overshadow the event, and they're worried about her behavior. They've already decided not to have bridesmaids to avoid including her. Other family members are pressuring the author to include her because she's their sister.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the sister is being difficult and has mental health issues that might affect her behavior. The author is a grown adult planning their own wedding, which is a significant event. They have the right to choose who they include in their wedding. The sister's behavior, as described, might indeed make the wedding stressful or take the focus away from the author.\n\nOn the other hand, excluding a family member, especially a sibling, can be sensitive. However, the author is not excluding her just because she's a sister but because of her actions and the potential issues they foresee. The sister is being pushy and the author is protecting their own well-being and the atmosphere of their wedding day. \n\nThe author's reasoning seems valid. They have friends they want to include instead, and they're avoiding situations where the sister might cause problems. The sister's mental health issues add another layer, but the author is not being cruel; they're setting boundaries for their own event. Family members pressuring the author to include her might be overstepping, as the wedding is the author's personal choice to organize.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the general consensus often supports individuals who are setting boundaries for their own events, especially when there's a history of problematic behavior. The sister's actions are described as demanding and self-centered, which justifies the author's decision. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
