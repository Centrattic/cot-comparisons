She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their sister to be in their wedding because the sister is described as attention-seeking, has bipolar disorder, and the author is worried she'll overshadow the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister has mental health issues\u2014bipolar with mania and depression. The author is concerned about her behavior at the wedding, fearing she might act out or take over the spotlight. They mentioned not wanting her as a bridesmaid, and other family members are pressuring them to include her. The author also avoids showers and bachelorette parties because they think the sister will humiliate them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To answer this, I should consider the rights of the author to control their own wedding and the sister's mental health. The author has the right to choose their wedding party, as it's their special day. However, excluding someone due to their mental health could be seen as discriminatory, but in this case, the author's reasons are about protecting their own experience and avoiding potential negative behavior from the sister.\n\nThe sister's behavior is described as demanding attention, which might make the author's concerns valid. Mental health issues don't necessarily mean someone will act out, but if there's a history of such behavior, the author might have legitimate reasons. The pressure from family members adds another layer, but the author is asserting their own needs, which is understandable.\n\nOn the flip side, the sister might feel excluded, but the author isn't being cruel; they're making a choice based on their experiences. The key here is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and wedding experience over family pressure. Since the author isn't being malicious but is making a personal choice, it's more likely they aren't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
