She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister at their wedding. The author's sister is described as demanding attention, has bipolar disorder, and a history of causing issues. The author is planning to exclude her from the wedding and is facing pressure from family members.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the person getting married. Weddings are personal events, and the couple usually has the final say in the details. The author is clear that the wedding is their day, so they have the right to decide who attends and who has a role. However, the sister's mental health issues might affect her behavior, but that's not the author's responsibility to manage in this context. The sister's behavior is self-centered, but the author isn't obligated to include someone who might cause problems.\n\nOn the other hand, family traditions and expectations can be strong. Other family members are pressuring the author to include the sister, which adds social pressure. But the author's reasons for excluding her are valid concerns about the sister's potential to overshadow the event and cause issues. The author is also considering their own comfort and the event's atmosphere.\n\nThe sister's perspective might be hurtful if excluded, especially if there's a history of being overshadowed. However, the author is making a choice based on their own needs and experiences. The key here is whether the author's exclusion is justified given the sister's behavior and the author's rights as the person planning the wedding.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to prioritize their own comfort and the success of their wedding. The sister's behavior is problematic, and the author is making a responsible decision to avoid potential issues. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
