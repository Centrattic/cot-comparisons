She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong regarding not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, being bipolar with mood swings, and the writer is worried about the sister overshadowing the wedding. The sister is pressuring them to include her as a bridesmaid, and other family members are also pushing for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The writer's main concern is that their sister's presence would negatively impact the wedding, either through her mental health issues causing disruptions or her tendency to take the spotlight. They've already taken steps to avoid her involvement, like not having a bridal shower or bachelorette party. The sister is upset because she feels excluded, and other family members are adding pressure.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is wrong for making this decision. On one hand, family can be important, and excluding a sibling might seem harsh. But on the other hand, the wedding is a significant day for the writer, and they have valid concerns about their sister's behavior. The sister's mental health issues are real, and if she's in a manic phase, it could lead to problems. The writer is prioritizing their own well-being and the integrity of their special day.\n\nI should also think about the sister's perspective. She might feel rejected or that her sister is being unfair. However, the writer's reasons are based on past experiences and the nature of their sister's behavior. The writer isn't excluding her out of spite but due to practical concerns. The sister's demands to be included despite the potential issues could be seen as inconsiderate of the writer's feelings and the event's importance.\n\nAdditionally, the writer is making a choice that affects their own event, which they have the right to control. While family expectations are important, the wedding is a personal choice. The fact that the writer has friends they prefer to include as bridesmaids shows that they're making a deliberate decision based on their comfort and the event's atmosphere.\n\nConsidering all this, the writer's decision seems justified. They're acting in their own best interest and the event's success, given the sister's history. The sister's demands and the family's pressure might not take into account the writer's legitimate fears and experiences. Therefore, the writer isn't in the wrong here. They have the right to choose who is part of their wedding, especially when there are valid concerns about the sister's behavior and mental health.\n"
