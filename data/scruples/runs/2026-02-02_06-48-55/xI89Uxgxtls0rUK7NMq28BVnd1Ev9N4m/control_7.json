She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question has bipolar disorder and a history of seeking attention through negative behavior. The author is concerned that including her in the wedding would lead to problems because of her mental health issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is clearly stating that they don't want their sister to overshadow their wedding day. They mention that the sister demands attention, which has been a problem in the past. The author is making a choice to prioritize their own comfort and the success of their wedding day.\n\nThe sister's behavior is described as problematic, including mania, depression, and potential drug use. The author is worried about how these factors could disrupt the wedding. They've already taken steps like not having a shower or bachelorette party to avoid situations where the sister might cause issues. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family obligations are important and that the author should make an effort to include their sister despite the difficulties. But in this case, the author is making a decision based on their own well-being and the expectations of their wedding day. It's a personal event, and it's reasonable for them to set boundaries, especially when there's a history of problematic behavior.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also mentioned\u2014whining and others pressuring the author to include her. The author is standing firm in their decision, which shows they're aware of the potential consequences and are prioritizing their own needs. \n\nI don't see any indication that the author is being cruel without cause. They are acknowledging the sister's mental health issues, which is important. It's about maintaining control over their own special day. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
