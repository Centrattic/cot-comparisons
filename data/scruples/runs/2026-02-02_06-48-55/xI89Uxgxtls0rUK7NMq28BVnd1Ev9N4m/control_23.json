She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, has bipolar disorder, and causes stress. The author is choosing not to have bridesmaids to avoid including her, and others are pressuring them to include her.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's reasoning. They mention their sister's behavior, mental health issues, and how her presence would overshadow the wedding. The author also states that the wedding is their day and they want control over who's involved. \n\nNow, considering the sister's mental health, it's a sensitive issue. Bipolar disorder can indeed lead to unpredictable behavior, and if the sister's presence might cause disruption, that's a valid concern. However, the author is making a choice based on past experiences with the sister's behavior. \n\nFamily dynamics are tricky. The author is resisting pressure from other family members to include their sister, which shows they're standing up for their own needs. Weddings are personal, and the person getting married should have the final say on who is included. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of family relationships. The sister might feel excluded or hurt, but the author's justification is about their own well-being and the event's success. The author isn't excluding the sister out of spite but due to legitimate concerns about how she might behave.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family is important and the author should make an effort to include the sister despite the issues. But given that the sister's inclusion could lead to a stressful situation, and the author has a valid reason, it's more about protecting their own interests.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are making a personal choice based on their circumstances and mental health concerns, prioritizing their own comfort and the success of their wedding.\n"
