She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of seeking attention, has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes, and the author is concerned she'll disrupt the wedding. The author also mentions not wanting a bridal shower or bachelorette party to avoid her sister's interference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's health. Bipolar disorder can affect behavior, and during manic or depressive episodes, someone might act out. The author has valid concerns about the sister's potential to overshadow the event. However, the sister is family, and sometimes family inclusion is expected, especially in a wedding. The author isn't directly excluding her but using the reason of not having bridesmaids. That might be a way to avoid conflict, but maybe others see it as avoidance.\n\nThe author's main argument is about their own wedding day being about them. They have friends they'd prefer as bridesmaids but choose not to include the sister. That seems like a personal choice, but the sister's feelings and the family's expectations might add pressure. The sister is upset because she's not included, and others are lecturing the author. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author has the right to choose who's in their wedding. Weddings are personal, and the person getting married should have final say. The sister's mental health is a factor, but the author isn't being cruel; they're setting boundaries. The sister's behavior in past events (humiliating the author) adds weight to the author's decision. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own comfort and the event's success. The sister's exclusion isn't malicious but necessary for the author's well-being. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
