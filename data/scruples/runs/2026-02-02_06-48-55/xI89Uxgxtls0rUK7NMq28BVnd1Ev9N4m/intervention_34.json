She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, being bipolar, and causing issues. The author is worried about the sister overshadowing the wedding, which is supposed to be their day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's mental health. Bipolar disorder can lead to mood swings, and the sister might act out during the wedding. The author is concerned about her behavior affecting the event. But is it fair to exclude her because of potential issues? Maybe the author should have talked to a professional to manage the sister's behavior, but that's not the case here.\n\nThe author mentioned not wanting bridesmaids to avoid including the sister. They also plan to exclude showers and bachelorette parties to prevent the sister's interference. The sister is upset because she's never been in a wedding and feels it's important. Family members are pressuring the author to include her, saying it's their duty.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, the wedding is the author's day, and they should have the final say. On the other hand, excluding a sibling could cause family tension, especially if the sister feels rejected. The sister's mental health might make the situation more complex. But the author has valid reasons for not wanting her there, given past behavior. The key here is the author's right to control their wedding versus the sister's feelings and family expectations.\n\nThe author isn't being malicious; they're making a decision based on their experiences. They're also trying to protect their event from potential disruptions. While it's tough, the decision seems personal and justified. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
