She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder, which causes her to act out, maybe through mania or depression. The author feels overshadowed by her and is worried about her causing issues during the wedding. They mentioned that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister, but the author wants to exclude her to keep the day about themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's situation. Bipolar disorder can lead to unpredictable behavior, especially if she's not managing it well. The author is concerned about her causing problems, which seems reasonable. They also mention that the sister demands attention and might overshadow the wedding. However, excluding a family member, even under these circumstances, could be seen as harsh or hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the wedding is a personal event, and the author has the right to decide who they want to participate in their special day. They\u2019re not being cruel by excluding someone, especially if they have valid reasons like mental health concerns. The sister's behavior might not be within the author's control, but the author is trying to protect their own experience.\n\nBut then again, maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps the author could include the sister in a way that doesn't involve her being a bridesmaid or in the main events. However, the author is clear that they don't want her involved at all. The sister's actions are self-centered, but the author's decision is about their own comfort and the event's focus.\n\nI need to check if there's a moral obligation to include family. Some might say yes, others no. The author's reasoning is personal and valid. They\u2019re not being mean without cause. The sister\u2019s mental health is a factor, but the author is making a choice based on their own needs. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the sister is being harmed by this exclusion, maybe there's a responsibility to include her. However, the question is about fault, not about the sister's feelings. \n\nI think the key points are: valid reasons for exclusion (the sister's behavior and mental health), the author's right to control their wedding, and the sister's own actions. The author isn't being unreasonable here. So answer B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
