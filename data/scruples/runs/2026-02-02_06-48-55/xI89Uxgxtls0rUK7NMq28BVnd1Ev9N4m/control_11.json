She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting their sister at their wedding because the sister has a history of demanding attention and has bipolar disorder, which could cause problems.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The sister in question is described as someone who constantly seeks attention, sometimes through negative means. The author is concerned that including her in the wedding would lead to issues due to her mental health. They have already decided not to have bridesmaids specifically to avoid her, and other family members are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to control their own wedding and the sister's behavior. Weddings are personal events, and the couple typically has the final say in who is included. However, family dynamics can complicate things, especially when there's a mental health aspect involved. The sister's mental health should be considered, but the author's well-being on their wedding day is also important.\n\nI should consider if the author is being unreasonable. They have valid concerns based on the sister's past behavior. The sister's actions could potentially disrupt the wedding. On the other hand, excluding a family member might cause family tensions. But the author is making a choice to protect their own experience, which is a reasonable stance.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's own feelings. The sister feels hurt and wants to be included. But the author's reasons are specific to their own comfort and the potential for the sister to overshadow the event. The author isn't being malicious; they're making a decision based on their knowledge of the sister's behavior.\n\nI should also consider if the author is being inconsiderate. They are aware of the sister's mental health issues and are trying to avoid a situation where the sister might act out. This shows consideration for both their own needs and the sister's potential state during the wedding.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision is based on their own well-being and the specific issues with their sister. While it might cause family conflict, they have the right to choose who is part of their wedding. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
