She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes, and the writer is concerned that including her would make the wedding about her instead of them. The sister is upset and other family members are pressuring the writer to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The writer doesn't want their sister to overshadow them, which is understandable given their experiences. The sister has mental health issues, which complicates things. The writer is trying to protect their own day from potential chaos but is facing family pressure. \n\nI should think about the ethical aspects here. Is it reasonable for the writer to prioritize their own comfort and the success of their wedding over family expectations? Mental health is a factor\u2014should others accommodate her sister's needs, or is the writer justified in setting boundaries? Also, the sister's behavior of seeking attention through negative means might be a red flag for the writer to avoid a stressful situation.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family obligations are important, and excluding a sibling could be hurtful. But the writer's reasons are specific: the sister's behavior history and mental health issues could disrupt the event. The writer isn't entirely cutting off the sister; they're choosing not to include her in a specific role. Friends are being included instead, which shows they're prioritizing positive relationships.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's reaction\u2014whining and others lecturing the writer. This might indicate that the sister is used to getting her way or that others aren't considering the writer's valid concerns. Family pressure can be intense, but the wedding is a personal event where the couple should have the final say.\n\nMental health considerations: The sister's bipolar disorder might lead to her needing more support, but the writer is worried about how her condition could manifest during the wedding. It's a balance between empathy and self-preservation. The writer might be protecting themselves from potential emotional or logistical challenges on their big day.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person's actions are justified given the circumstances. Here, the writer has clear reasons based on past experiences and the sister's behavior. They are setting boundaries to avoid a situation where their day is compromised. The sister's demands and the family's pressure add tension, but the writer's choice to exclude her isn't necessarily malicious\u2014it's self-protective.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer is not in the wrong. They are making a personal choice to ensure their wedding is what they want, considering the sister's history. Answer B.\n"
