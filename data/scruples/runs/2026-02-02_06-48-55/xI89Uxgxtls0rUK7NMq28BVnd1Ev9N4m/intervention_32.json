She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question is described as demanding attention, has bipolar disorder, and has a history of causing issues. The writer is concerned about the sister overshadowing the wedding and causing problems due to her mental health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She's a family member and the writer's sibling. The family and friends are arguing that the sister should be included. But the writer is standing their ground because of past negative experiences and the potential for more issues on their wedding day. \n\nOn one hand, the sister has a mental health condition, which can affect her behavior. The writer is worried about her sister's possible actions during the wedding, which is a valid concern. However, the sister's behavior seems to be more about attention-seeking rather than just the mental illness. The writer is also protecting their own day by setting boundaries. \n\nBut, there might be an expectation that family should be included in a wedding, especially a sibling. The writer is excluding the sister, not just avoiding her but actively not wanting her there. This could be seen as harsh if the sister is genuinely trying to connect or if her inclusion is important for family harmony. However, the writer has reasons based on past experiences. \n\nThe key points are the sister's mental health and the writer's right to have their day go smoothly. If the sister's presence is likely to cause distress or disruption, then the writer's decision might be justified. On the other hand, if the sister is being excluded without a valid reason, that could be seen as wrong. But the writer does provide specific reasons\u2014past behavior, potential for disruption, and personal choice to not have her sister there. \n\nI think the writer has a legitimate reason to set this boundary. Weddings are personal events, and the person has the right to choose who attends and participates. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The sister's mental health could affect her actions, but the writer is aware and making a choice based on that. I don't see the writer being in the wrong here.\n"
