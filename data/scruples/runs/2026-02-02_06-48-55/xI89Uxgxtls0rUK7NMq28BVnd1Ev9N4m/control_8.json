She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of seeking attention, has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes, and the author is worried about her causing issues on their wedding day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's sister is described as demanding attention, making outrageous statements, and having mental health issues. The author is concerned that including her in the wedding would lead to her overshadowing the event, either through stress, depression, or drug use. The author has even decided not to have bridesmaids explicitly to exclude her, but others are pressuring them to include her because of their familial relationship.\n\nThe key here is the author's right to choose who is part of their wedding. Weddings are personal events, and it's common for people to select their attendants based on their preferences. The author has valid concerns about their sister's behavior and mental health potentially affecting the day. Additionally, they mention friends they would prefer to include, which supports their choice being about personal preference and well-being.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint about family pressure. The sister's argument is that she's never been in a wedding and wants to be part of this one. Also, other family members are pressuring the author to include her because she's family. But the wedding is the author's event, and they have the final say on who's involved. Mental health issues shouldn't be used as a reason to force inclusion if it causes distress for the person organizing the event.\n\nI should also consider if there's any obligation to include a sibling in a wedding. While some people might include siblings, it's not a universal requirement. The author is making a decision based on their own comfort and the potential negative impact of their sister's involvement. The sister's mental health is a valid concern, especially if it could lead to unpredictable behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's reaction. She started \"whining,\" which might indicate she's aware of her behavior but is still trying to push for inclusion. The author's decision might be a boundary-setting act to protect their own mental health and the integrity of their wedding day.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose their wedding party and prioritize their own well-being. The sister's needs, while valid in terms of her mental health, shouldn't override the author's personal wishes for their event. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
