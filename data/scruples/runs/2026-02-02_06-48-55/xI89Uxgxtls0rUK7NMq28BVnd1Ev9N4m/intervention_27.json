She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and tends to demand attention, which the author is worried will overshadow their own day. The author has friends they'd prefer as bridesmaids but is avoiding the sister because of past experiences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They feel that their wedding should be about them, and they have valid concerns about the sister's behavior negatively impacting the event. The sister's mental health is a factor here, but the author is using that as a reason to exclude her. The sister is upset and other family members are pressuring the author to include her, but the author is standing their ground.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is a family member, and weddings are often seen as family-centric events. The author might be making a choice that could hurt their sister's feelings, but they have their reasons. The sister's mental health could be a consideration in how the author approaches the exclusion. Maybe the author could have communicated more compassionately while still setting boundaries. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the sister's presence would make the day about her, which the author wants to avoid. The sister's behavior, as described, is intrusive and attention-seeking, which could indeed be stressful for the author. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and the success of their wedding day. \n\nHowever, the sister's family role is a common expectation, and excluding a sibling can be seen as harsh. But the author isn't excluding all family members, just this sister because of specific issues. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for making a personal choice about their own event. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to plan their wedding as they see fit. The sister's behavior and mental health issues are legitimate concerns. The author is not being cruel but is protecting their own needs. The answer should be B for No.\n"
