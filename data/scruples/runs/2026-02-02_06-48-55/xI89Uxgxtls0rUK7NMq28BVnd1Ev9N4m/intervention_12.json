She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question has bipolar disorder, is demanding attention, and has a history of causing issues. The author is concerned that including her in the wedding will make it about her instead of the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's mental health is mentioned\u2014bipolar with mania and depression. The author is worried about her behavior during the wedding, like being stressed, drugged up, etc. The sister is whining and others are pressuring the author to include her. The author is prioritizing friends as bridesmaids over family and is excluding traditional events like a shower to avoid her sister's interference.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. Weddings are personal, and the couple usually has the final say on who is in their wedding party. The sister's behavior and the author's valid concerns about her mental health could justify excluding her. However, family dynamics can complicate things. But the author isn't being cruel; they're making a choice to protect their own well-being and the integrity of their special day. The author is not forcing the sister to attend the wedding, just not giving her a central role. The sister's mental health might also be a factor where the author is trying to avoid putting her in a high-stress situation, which could be seen as considerate. On the other hand, the sister's exclusion might cause family tension, but the author has the right to decide their own wedding's structure. So, I think the author is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
