She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister is described as having bipolar disorder, demanding attention, and causing issues. The author is worried about the sister overshadowing the wedding, possibly due to her mental health struggles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author's main concern is their personal comfort and the integrity of their special day. They mention that their sister's behavior has historically been problematic, and they want to avoid that. On the other hand, the sister and other family members are pressuring the author to include her, which adds family dynamics into the mix.\n\nFrom a rights-based perspective, the author is within their rights to choose who attends their wedding and who has a role in it. Weddings are personal events, and the person getting married should have the final say. However, there's also the aspect of family relationships. The sister has a mental health condition, which might require empathy and understanding. The author's decision could be seen as prioritizing their own needs over their sister's feelings, which might be a point of contention.\n\nBut then again, the sister's behavior is described as \"outrageous\" and attention-seeking, which could make the wedding stressful. The author is also considering the well-being of themselves and possibly their guests. There's a balance between being considerate and setting boundaries. The author isn't excluding the sister out of malice but due to past experiences and concerns about the event's atmosphere.\n\nThe sister's mental health is a factor here. If the exclusion is due to her mental health issues, that might be seen as discriminatory or insensitive. However, if it's about managing the event's dynamics, it's more about practicality. The author is also not inviting other family members, which could indicate a pattern of prioritizing personal preferences over family expectations.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person made a reasonable decision given the circumstances. The author is making a choice that affects family relations but is within their right. The sister's mental health could be part of the story, but the author's decision is based on self-preservation and event planning. The key is whether the author's reasoning is valid and if it's fair to expect family to accept that.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they have the right to make choices about their wedding, especially given the sister's history. However, there's a nuance in considering the sister's mental health and the author's responsibility towards family dynamics. But ultimately, the decision is the author's to make, and they are not in the wrong for that.\n"
