She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, being bipolar, and causing issues. The author is avoiding having her as a bridesmaid and even skipping a shower or bachelorette party to avoid her interference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has mental health issues (bipolar), which can lead to unpredictable behavior. The author is concerned about the sister overshadowing the wedding, which is a major life event. The author also mentions that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister, but the author feels it's their right to have control over their wedding.\n\nMental health is a sensitive topic. While the sister's behavior is problematic, the author's decision might be seen as self-preservation. However, the sister's needs and feelings could also be valid. The author is prioritizing their own comfort and the integrity of their special day, which is understandable. On the other hand, excluding a sibling might be seen as harsh, especially if the sister is trying to be included despite her issues.\n\nBut the sister's actions, like \"whining\" and making it about herself, might be contributing to the situation. The author is making a choice to protect their event from potential disruptions. Weddings are personal, and guests expect to follow the couple's wishes. So, the author isn't necessarily being mean; they're setting boundaries. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The sister's mental health might mean she's not in a good place, but the author has a right to decide who is part of their wedding. It's about respecting personal choices versus family expectations. The pressure from other family members adds another layer, but the author is asserting their autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to control their wedding. The sister's issues don't obligate the author to include her, especially if it causes distress. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
