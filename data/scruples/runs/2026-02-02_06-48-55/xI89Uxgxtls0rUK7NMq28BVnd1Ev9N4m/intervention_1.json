She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is the sister not wanting to include her other sister in her wedding. The sister in question is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder, and tends to make things about herself. The author is worried that including her in the wedding would overshadow her own day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They want their wedding to be about them and their partner. They mention that the other sister has a history of causing issues, and they don't want her to disrupt the event. They also feel that they've been overshadowed by her in the past. The author is making a choice to prioritize their own comfort and the success of their wedding over the expectations of family members. That seems reasonable because a wedding is a personal event, and the bride should have final say over who is included.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is not being included in the wedding, which could be hurtful. However, the author isn't cutting her out entirely; they're just not making her a bridesmaid or allowing her to have a specific role. The author is also standing up to family pressure, which might be valid if the sister's presence is indeed problematic. The sister's mental health is a factor here\u2014she has bipolar disorder, but that doesn't mean she should be included in the wedding if it's going to cause issues. The author is making a judgment call based on past experiences and potential future problems.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. Traditionally, family members like siblings are often included in weddings, but it's not a strict rule. The author is choosing friends over family for the bridesmaids, which some might question, but if the author is uncomfortable with the sister's behavior, it's their right to decide. The key here is that the author is not excluding the sister out of spite but because of genuine concerns about the sister's behavior and the impact on the wedding day.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's reaction. She's \"whining\" and other family members are pressuring the author. The author is firm in their decision, which shows they are standing up for themselves. The sister's demands might be part of her tendency to seek attention, which the author is trying to avoid. The author's decision could be seen as self-protective rather than inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, there's a possible downside. The sister might feel rejected, which could strain the relationship. But the author's mental well-being and the success of their wedding are also important. The author is making a choice that prioritizes their own needs, which is understandable. The fact that they've already decided against a shower and bachelorette party because of the sister's behavior further supports their decision not to include her in the wedding itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision seems justified given the sister's history and the author's concerns. While it's a sensitive situation, the author is within their rights to choose who they want in their wedding. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are making a personal choice to protect their event from potential issues caused by the sister's behavior.\n"
