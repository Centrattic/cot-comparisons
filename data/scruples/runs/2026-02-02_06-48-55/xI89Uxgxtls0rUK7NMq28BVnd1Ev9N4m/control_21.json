She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister in question has bipolar disorder and a history of seeking attention through dramatic behavior, including during manic or depressive episodes. The author is concerned that including their sister would lead to her overshadowing the wedding, which is supposed to be their special day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has mental health issues that affect her behavior, which the author has experienced firsthand. The author is explicitly stating that they don't want their sister in the wedding, not just because of her actions but because they've been overshadowed in the past. They've already taken steps to exclude her by not having a traditional bridal party and avoiding events like a bachelorette party where the sister might cause issues.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on protecting their own needs and ensuring the wedding is about them. They mention friends they would prefer to have as bridesmaids instead. On the other hand, family members are pressuring them to include the sister because of their familial relationship. \n\nNow, legally and ethically, a person has the right to choose who attends their wedding and who is part of the bridal party. The sister's mental health is a factor, but the author is making a personal choice based on their comfort and past experiences. The sister's behavior is a documented pattern, so the author isn't just being irrational. They're trying to prevent potential disruption and emotional distress on their wedding day.\n\nHowever, there's a balance here. The sister's exclusion might be hurtful, especially given their relationship. But the author is prioritizing their own well-being. It's important to note that the author isn't excluding the sister just because of her mental health but because of specific behaviors that have caused problems. The author is also considering close friends over family, which is a common but sensitive decision.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the impact. Here, the intent is to protect the wedding day experience, and the impact is on the sister's feelings. Since the author has made their stance clear and has valid reasons based on the sister's history, it's likely they're not in the wrong. The sister's mental health doesn't obligate the author to include her if it's detrimental to their own event.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
