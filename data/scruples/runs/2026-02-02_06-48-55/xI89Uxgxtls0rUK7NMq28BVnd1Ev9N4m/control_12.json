She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. Let me read through the situation again. The sister in question is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder, and there are concerns about how she might act in the wedding\u2014either being too stressed, depressed, or on medication. The author doesn't want her in the wedding because they feel overshadowed, and other family members are pressuring the author to include her. The author also mentioned not having a shower or bachelorette party to avoid humiliation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making a personal choice about their wedding, which is a significant event. Weddings are typically very personal, and the couple usually decides who to invite and in what roles. The sister's behavior, as described, could potentially disrupt the event. However, the sister's mental health is a factor too. The author's decision might be seen as self-protective but could also be viewed as being harsh or excluding family without considering the sister's feelings.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to control their wedding and ensure it's a positive experience. On the other hand, there's the aspect of family and the sister's potential feelings. The sister's mental health issues might make her more sensitive to exclusion. But the author has valid concerns about the sister's behavior affecting the wedding. The key points here are the author's right to their own event and the sister's possible mental health needs versus the author's need for a stress-free day.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is justified in their concerns about the sister's behavior, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the exclusion is based on preconceived notions or lack of communication, maybe they are. But the sister is being demanding and has a history of causing issues, so the author's decision could be seen as necessary. Also, the other family members pressuring the author might be adding to the stress. The author is trying to avoid a situation where the sister overshadows the wedding again. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No), because the author is making a personal choice to protect their own experience, especially given the sister's past behavior and the potential for the wedding to become about her instead. The author isn't obligated to include family members if it's going to cause problems. However, there's a balance between personal choice and family dynamics, but in this case, the author's justification seems valid.\n"
