She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of attention-seeking behavior and mental health issues. The author is concerned that including her would lead to problems on their special day. They also mention that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. Weddings are personal events, and the author feels that their sister's presence would overshadow them. They might feel that their mental health and the success of the day are at stake. The sister's behavior, including being bipolar and using substances, could indeed make the event stressful. The author is making a choice to protect their own experience, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's side: she's being excluded by a family member during a significant event. If she's struggling with mental health, exclusion might affect her negatively. The family members pushing for her inclusion might believe it's important for family unity. However, the author is not being inconsiderate of their sister's feelings entirely; they're making a tough call based on their own well-being.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to control their wedding and their sister's mental health. While family can be important, the wedding is a personal choice. The author isn't cutting off the sister entirely but is setting boundaries. The sister's behavior has been problematic in the past, so the author's caution is understandable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on the action and its justification. The author isn't doing something unethical; they're prioritizing their own needs. The sister's feelings are hurt, but the author isn't the one acting unkindly without cause. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
