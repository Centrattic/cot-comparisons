She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder, demands attention, and the author is afraid she'll overshadow the wedding. They mentioned the sister's behavior issues, like acting out for attention, being on medications, and causing stress. The author decided not to have bridesmaids to avoid including her, and other family members are pressuring them to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points: the sister's mental health issues, the author's right to control their wedding, and family pressure. The author is clear that their wedding day is important to them and they want it to be about them, not their sister. The sister's behavior history is a valid concern\u2014especially if she's had past incidents that caused problems. Mental health is a factor here; the sister's mania or depression could lead to her not acting appropriately at the wedding.\n\nThe author's decision to exclude her isn't because they don't care about her but because they want to avoid potential chaos on their day. Weddings are personal events, and the person getting married should have the final say on who's included. Family members pushing for inclusion might not realize the emotional toll it could take on the author. The sister's reaction of whining and others lecturing the author adds to the pressure, but the author is standing their ground for a valid reason.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Is excluding a family member too harsh? But the author isn't excluding her entirely; they're just not giving her a specific role. Also, the sister's mental health issues could be managed with support, but the author isn't in the position to manage her condition. The author's priority is their own well-being and the success of their wedding. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
