She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes, and the author is worried about her causing issues during the wedding. The author chose not to have bridesmaids, but others are pressuring them to include the sister because she's their sibling. The author's reasoning is that the wedding should be about them, not their sister, and they don't want her overshadowing the event. They also mention not wanting a shower or bachelorette party because of the sister's potential behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're planning a significant life event, their wedding, and they have legitimate concerns about their sister's behavior affecting the day. The sister's mental health issues, like bipolar disorder, could indeed lead to unpredictable behavior. The author is also dealing with family pressure to include the sister, which adds stress. The author's main point is about wanting control over their wedding and avoiding the sister's negative influence.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister being excluded from such a major family event might be hurtful. If the sister is part of the family, others might see her inclusion as important, especially if she's been excluded in the past. The author mentions that the sister has never been in a wedding before and wants to be in this one. However, the author is clear that they don't want her there because of past experiences and anticipated issues.\n\nNow, considering mental health: excluding someone because of their mental health condition could be seen as discriminatory. But the author's concerns are about the sister's potential behavior affecting the wedding. It's a balance between the author's right to have their wedding as they wish and the sister's right to be included in family events. \n\nFrom a family dynamics perspective, the author might be protecting themselves from potential trauma or stress on their wedding day. They have friends they'd prefer to include as bridesmaids, which is their choice. However, family expectations can be strong, and the author is facing pushback from others. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong if they're making a decision based on their own needs and well-being. Weddings are deeply personal, and the couple should have final say. The sister's behavior does play a role here\u2014constant attention-seeking and potential instability are valid concerns. \n\nBut could there be a middle ground? Maybe the sister could have a smaller role that doesn't place her in the spotlight. However, the author's main issue is the sister's presence in a prominent role like a bridesmaid. If the sister's participation would cause the author significant stress or disrupt the event, then the author's decision is justified.\n\nIn conclusion, while the sister might feel hurt, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own experience and mental health on such an important day. The answer is B.\n"
