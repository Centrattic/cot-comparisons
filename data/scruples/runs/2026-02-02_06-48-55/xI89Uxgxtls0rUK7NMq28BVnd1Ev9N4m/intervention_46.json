She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for not inviting their sister to their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister is described as someone who constantly demands attention and has bipolar disorder, leading to mania and depression. The author is concerned that the sister will overshadow the wedding, either by being overly stressed, under the influence of medication, or acting out. The author has decided not to include the sister, not even mentioning it directly, and other family members are pressuring them to include her because she's family. The author is resisting because they want their wedding to be about them, not their sister.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's behavior and the author's right to make their wedding about themselves. The sister's mental health issues are part of the context, but the author is using that as a reason to exclude her. However, the author is also making decisions that could affect other people's expectations, like family members and friends.\n\nI need to consider if the author has the right to exclude someone from their wedding. Weddings are personal, and the person getting married usually has the final say. But there's also the aspect of family dynamics and potential hurt feelings. The sister's mental health might be a factor; if she's not stable, including her could be stressful for everyone. But is it fair to exclude someone based on potential behavior? The author mentions that they have friends they'd like to include instead, which suggests they're prioritizing relationships that are more positive for them.\n\nThe sister is not being excluded just because of her mental health but because of her behavior. The author is also taking steps to prevent the sister from causing issues in other events like the shower. This indicates a pattern of concern. However, the sister might feel hurt or abandoned, but the author is focused on their own well-being on a significant day.\n\nI think the author is justified in making their wedding about themselves and their chosen relationships. While it might hurt the sister, the author is not obligated to include everyone. The sister's behavior could indeed disrupt the event, so the author's decision is self-protective. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
