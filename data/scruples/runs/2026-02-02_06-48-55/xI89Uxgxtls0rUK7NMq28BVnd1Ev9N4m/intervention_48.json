She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister is described as someone who constantly demands attention and has bipolar disorder with mania and depression. The author is worried that including her in the wedding would lead to issues because of her mental health. They also mention that the sister started whining about not being in the wedding and that other family members are pressuring them to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the person getting married. Weddings are personal events, and the couple typically has the final say on who is included. The author has friends they want as bridesmaids, which suggests they might be making a choice that prioritizes their comfort and the event's atmosphere. The sister's behavior\u2014being demanding, making the day about her, and having mental health issues\u2014could indeed affect the wedding's dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, family members, especially siblings, often expect to be part of such significant events. The sister's mental health is a factor here. While the author is concerned about her behavior, it's possible that the sister's issues are being used as a justification for excluding her. However, the author is honest about their feelings, which might show they're making a genuine choice based on their experiences.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to control their wedding, the sister's behavior and its potential impact, and the pressure from family. The author isn't being mean-spirited about it, they're just making a choice for their own well-being. So, I think the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to decide who is part of their wedding, especially considering the sister's history. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
