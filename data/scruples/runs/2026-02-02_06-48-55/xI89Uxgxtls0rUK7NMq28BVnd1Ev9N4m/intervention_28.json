She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and a history of seeking attention, sometimes in disruptive ways. The author is worried that including her would lead to the wedding being about her instead of the author. They also mention not wanting a shower or bachelorette party because of the sister's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is making a personal choice about their wedding, which is a significant event. They have valid concerns about the sister's behavior potentially affecting the event. The sister is being left out, but the author is clear that this is their decision. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nOn one hand, family dynamics can be complex, and there might be pressure from others to include the sister. However, the wedding is the author's event, and they have the right to choose who attends and who has a specific role. The sister's mental health issues don't necessarily mean she should be excluded, but the author is making a judgment based on her past behavior. It's important to respect the author's autonomy in planning their own wedding. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the sister's feelings could be hurt, and there's a risk of family conflict. But the author is not being mean; they're managing their own event and protecting their well-being. The sister's behavior is a factor here, and the author is prioritizing their own needs, which is understandable.\n\nThe author also mentions not wanting showers or bachelorette parties because of the sister's potential actions, which indicates a pattern of behavior that the author is trying to avoid. So, excluding her from the wedding is a logical step to prevent possible issues. \n\nI think the author is within their rights to make this decision. They are not forcing anyone to attend, just not giving the sister a specific role. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). The key is the author's right to control their own wedding and the sister's history of causing problems. The sister's mental health isn't a reason to include her if it's going to negatively impact the author's day."
