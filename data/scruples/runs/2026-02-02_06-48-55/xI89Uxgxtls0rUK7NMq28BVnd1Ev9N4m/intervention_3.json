She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister is described as constantly seeking attention, has bipolar disorder, and the author is worried about her causing issues during the wedding. The author also mentions that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They want their wedding day to be about them and their partner, not their sister. The sister's behavior in the past, like being drugged or causing humiliation, is a valid concern. The author is making a personal choice about their own event, so they might have a right to exclude someone if it's necessary for their mental health and the event's success.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's feelings might be hurt. The author didn't directly tell her but gave a vague reason about not having bridesmaids. However, the sister is being pushy and others are pressuring the author. The sister has a mental health condition, which complicates things. The author's decision could be seen as necessary for their own well-being, especially if the sister's past behavior is a legitimate concern. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to control their wedding and the sister's history of problematic behavior. The author isn't being cruel; they're setting boundaries. The sister's actions are more disruptive. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own needs and the event's atmosphere. The answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
