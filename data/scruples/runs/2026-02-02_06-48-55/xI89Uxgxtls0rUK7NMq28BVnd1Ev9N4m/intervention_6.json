She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question is described as attention-seeking, has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes, and the author is concerned about her behavior during the wedding. The author mentioned they didn't want bridesmaids to avoid including the sister and is facing pressure from family to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here: the author's right to control their wedding as the main event. Weddings are deeply personal, and the author is prioritizing their comfort and the event's success. On the other hand, family pressure is significant, especially involving a sibling.\n\nThe sister's behavior is problematic, including demands for attention and potential instability due to her mental health. The author's concerns about the sister overshadowing the wedding or causing issues are valid. They also mention friends they'd prefer to have as bridesmaids instead. The sister's history of negative behavior in previous events (like the shower or bachelorette party) adds to the author's legitimate worries.\n\nHowever, the sister's mental health is a factor here. Bipolar disorder can lead to unpredictable behavior, which the author anticipates. The author isn't excluding the sister out of malice but out of practical concerns. The family's insistence might be coming from a place of wanting to include the sister, but they might not be considering the author's well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the author's decision is justified. Weddings are the couple's day, and the author is making a choice to protect their experience. While it's hard to exclude family, especially a sibling, the author's reasons are based on past experiences and specific concerns. The sister might feel hurt, but the author's primary responsibility is to their own happiness on the big day.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they are making a personal choice based on valid concerns. The sister's actions and the author's need for control over their wedding day are key factors here. So the answer should be B.\n"
