She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their sister to be in their wedding because the sister is demanding attention and has mental health issues like bipolar disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister is described as constantly demanding attention, says outrageous things, and has mania/depression episodes. The author is concerned that having her in the wedding will make it about her sister, not them. They mentioned not having bridesmaids specifically to avoid including the sister. Other family members are pressuring the author to include her, and the sister is whining about it.\n\nThe author is trying to protect their wedding day from being overshadowed, which is a significant event in their life. They also mention not wanting a shower or bachelorette party to avoid humiliation from the sister. The sister's behavior is causing stress, and the author is trying to maintain control over their event.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms, weddings are personal events where the couple usually decides the guest list and roles of participants. Family members might feel entitled to certain roles, but the bride has the right to choose who is in her wedding party. The sister's mental health issues add complexity, but it's not the author's responsibility to accommodate the sister's needs if it conflicts with their own plans. However, it's important to consider if there's a way to include the sister in a less prominent role if possible, but the author explicitly states they don't want the sister in any role. \n\nThe sister's behavior of demanding attention and past actions (like humiliating the author) give the author valid reasons to exclude her. The pressure from other family members shouldn't override the bride's wishes. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and the integrity of their special day. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
