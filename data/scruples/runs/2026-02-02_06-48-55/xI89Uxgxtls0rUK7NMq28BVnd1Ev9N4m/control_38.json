She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of demanding attention, making outrageous statements, and has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes. The author is concerned that in the wedding, the sister might cause issues due to her mental state\u2014like being stressed, depressed, drugged up, etc. The author mentioned they\u2019re avoiding a shower and bachelorette party because of this sister's potential behavior, such as humiliating them in front of friends and the future sister-in-law.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's mental health and the author's right to control their own wedding. The author didn't explicitly state not wanting her, but the sister is aware due to the lack of bridesmaids and other family members pushing for her inclusion. The author's friends might be excluded if the sister is included, which adds another layer of conflict.\n\nBipolar disorder can lead to unpredictable behavior, especially if not managed well. The author has valid concerns about the sister's ability to handle the stress of a wedding and the potential for her to take over the event. However, the sister is part of the family, and her feelings might be hurt. The question is about the author's responsibility here.\n\nOn one hand, the wedding is the author's day, and they have the right to choose who attends and participates. On the other hand, excluding a family member, even with good reasons, might cause family tension. But the author's reasons are based on past experiences and specific health issues. They\u2019re not excluding her out of spite but to protect the integrity of their event and their own well-being.\n\nFamily members pressuring the author to include the sister could be a factor. The author's decision should be respected, even if others disagree. The sister's behavior has been a long-term issue, so the author isn't just making a snap judgment. They\u2019ve thought about the implications and how it could affect the wedding.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re making a personal choice to avoid a stressful situation and ensure their wedding is on their terms, given the sister's history and mental health challenges. The answer should be B.\n"
