She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister at their wedding. The sister has a history of seeking attention, being bipolar with mood swings, and causing issues. The author is avoiding having her as a bridesmaid or in any significant role, which family members are pressuring them to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's behavior is problematic\u2014she demands attention, has mental health issues, and the author is concerned about her disrupting the wedding. The author is being pressured by family to include her, but they don't want her overshadowing the event. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for prioritizing their own comfort and the success of their wedding? Well, weddings are personal events, and the person getting married should have the final say on who attends and their role. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The sister's mental health is a factor too\u2014maybe the author is being overly harsh, but if the sister's behavior is genuinely disruptive, it's reasonable to exclude her to avoid a crisis during the event.\n\nAlso, the sister is being manipulative, using the fact that she's a sibling as leverage. The author is trying to protect their day from potential issues. While it's possible the sister might feel hurt, the author's right to choose their own wedding details is valid. The answer likely leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because personal preference and event management are their prerogative, especially given the sister's history."
