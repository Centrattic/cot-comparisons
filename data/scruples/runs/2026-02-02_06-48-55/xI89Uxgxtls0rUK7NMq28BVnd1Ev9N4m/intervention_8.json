She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author mentions that their sister constantly demands attention, is bipolar, and has a history of acting out to get attention, whether positive or negative. The author is worried that if the sister is in the wedding, it might become about her due to her mental health issues. The sister is upset and other family members are pressuring the author to include her. The author explains they\u2019re not having bridesmaids specifically to avoid including the sister. They also don\u2019t want a shower or bachelorette party because of past experiences with the sister.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the author's right to choose their wedding party. Weddings are personal, and the person getting married typically selects their attendants. The sister's behavior and mental health issues are real concerns. If the sister has a history of causing problems, the author has valid reasons to exclude her for their own peace of mind and to prevent potential issues on their big day.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being selfish by not including a family member, especially if the sister is part of the family and has a right to be there. But given the sister's history, the author's decision could be seen as necessary to protect their own well-being. Mental health struggles can lead to unpredictable behavior, and the author isn't obligated to put themselves in a situation that could be stressful or uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction (whining) and other family members' pressure might indicate that there's a history of the sister being difficult. The author's choice to prioritize their own comfort and the success of their wedding seems reasonable. They're not being unkind if they explain their reasons clearly, even if it's hard for the family to accept.\n\nOn the flip side, if the author's exclusion is based on stereotypes about bipolar disorder or not providing the sister a chance despite her efforts to manage her condition, that could be problematic. But the author does mention specific past behaviors and concerns, which suggests their decision is based on real experiences, not just assumptions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision seems justified given the sister's history and the potential for disruption. The wedding is a personal event, and the author has the right to make decisions to ensure it's their day. So the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
