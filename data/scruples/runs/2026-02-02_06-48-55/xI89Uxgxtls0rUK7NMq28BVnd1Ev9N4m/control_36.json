She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question has bipolar disorder and a history of demanding attention, which the author is concerned will overshadow the wedding. The author also mentions that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. Weddings are personal events, and the bride typically has the final say in how their day is structured. The sister's behavior, including possible substance use and mental health issues, could create a problematic situation. The author is trying to avoid a scenario where the wedding becomes about the sister instead of them. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister is being excluded from a significant family event, which might be hurtful. However, the author isn't being cruel; they're making a decision based on their own well-being and the potential for the sister's actions to disrupt the wedding. The author is also considering their own mental health and the stress of dealing with the sister's demands.\n\nMental health plays a role here. The sister's bipolar disorder could lead to unpredictable behavior, which the author is realistically trying to prevent. While it's important to be considerate, the author's main priority is their own day. The fact that the author is not inviting the sister for a specific reason and is standing by that decision, despite family pressure, suggests that they are making a conscious choice for their own good.\n\nOther family members lecturing the author might add pressure, but the author is not obligated to comply with their demands. The decision to exclude the sister doesn't necessarily make the author wrong, especially if they have valid concerns backed by past behavior. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not forcing the sister to exclude herself but is making a choice to protect their own event. It's a tough situation, but the author's right to control their wedding day should be respected. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
