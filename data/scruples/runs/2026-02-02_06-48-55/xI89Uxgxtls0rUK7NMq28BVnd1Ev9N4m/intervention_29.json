She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The author explains that their sister has a history of seeking constant attention, has bipolar disorder with manic and depressive episodes, and they\u2019re worried about her behavior during the wedding. They mentioned not wanting bridesmaids to avoid including her and faced pressure from family members.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the wedding person. A wedding is a personal event, and the couple typically has the final say in who attends and their roles. The author is making a choice to prioritize their own comfort and the event's atmosphere, which is understandable. However, the sister's feelings are also a factor here. The sister might feel excluded, especially if family members are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nThe sister's mental health is a point to consider. If she has bipolar disorder, her behavior could be unpredictable, which the author is concerned about. However, excluding someone from a family event can be a sensitive issue, even if there are valid reasons. The author might be seen as prioritizing their own needs, which is reasonable, but they could also be perceived as being harsh on their sister, especially if the sister is vulnerable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is that their sister tends to overshadow them and might cause problems. The author is trying to prevent potential issues, which could be a valid self-protective measure. The family's insistence on including the sister adds pressure, but the author's right to make their own choices about their wedding should be respected.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. The wedding is their event, so they have the right to decide. However, the sister's potential mental health issues and the author's preemptive exclusion might lead to questions about whether they could have communicated better or found a compromise. But given the sister's history, the author's concerns are legitimate. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
