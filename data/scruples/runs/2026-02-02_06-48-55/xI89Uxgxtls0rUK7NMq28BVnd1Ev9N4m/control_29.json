She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting their sister at their wedding. The sister in question has bipolar disorder and a history of seeking attention in problematic ways. The author is concerned about the sister's behavior affecting the wedding day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's mental health issues are mentioned\u2014bipolar with manic and depressive episodes. The author is worried about her causing disruptions, either through stress, being drugged, or other behaviors. The sister is upset and others are pressuring the author to include her. The author also mentions not wanting showers or bachelorette parties to avoid humiliation.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, the person planning the wedding has the right to decide who's invited and who has a role. Emotionally, it's a family matter. However, the sister's mental health could affect her behavior. But the author is setting boundaries to protect their own well-being. They have valid reasons based on past experiences. On the other hand, excluding a sibling might cause family tension, but the author's autonomy is important. The sister's needs might require support, but the wedding is the author's day. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their comfort and the event's success. Answer B.\n"
