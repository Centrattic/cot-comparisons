She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister is described as someone who demands attention, has bipolar disorder with mania and depression, and a history of causing issues. The author is avoiding having her as a bridesmaid, not having a shower or bachelorette party due to fears of humiliation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They feel overshadowed by their sister and are worried about her behavior negatively affecting their special day. They also mention that they have friends they'd prefer to include instead. Their reasons seem valid in terms of wanting to control their own wedding experience without potential disruptions.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister is a family member, and there's a societal expectation that siblings are included in weddings. The author might be seen as avoiding a family obligation. However, the sister's mental health issues are a factor here. The author is making a choice to prioritize their own well-being and the integrity of their event. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Legally, no. They have the right to decide who attends their wedding and who has a role. The sister's mental health might contribute to her behavior, but the author isn't obligated to include her if it causes them stress. However, the sister's feelings and family dynamics could complicate things. The author's decision could be seen as self-protective rather than inconsiderate, especially given the sister's history.\n\nThe key points are the sister's mental health issues and the author's justified concerns about the wedding being about her. The author is making a choice that prioritizes their own comfort and the event's success. So, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for making this decision.\n"
