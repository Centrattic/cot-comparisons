She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister is described as constantly demanding attention, has bipolar disorder, and the author is worried about her causing issues on their big day. The sister is upset and other family members are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main reason is that their sister's behavior and mental health could overshadow the wedding. They mention not wanting a shower or bachelorette party because of the sister's potential to humiliate them. The sister is upset and feels excluded, and other family members are pushing for her inclusion.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In the AITA context, the community often looks at intent and fairness. The author is making a personal choice about their wedding, which is a deeply personal event. They have a legitimate concern about their sister's mental health and how it might affect the day. However, the sister is a family member, and excluding her might be seen as harsh, especially if the author is using the absence of bridesmaids as a reason. The author's friends are willing to be bridesmaids, which could be a point in their favor, showing that the decision is not about not having people, but specifically about the sister.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's mental health is a real issue. People with bipolar disorder can have episodes, and the author is justified in wanting to avoid a stressful situation. The author is also setting boundaries for their own well-being, which is important. However, the sister might feel hurt and excluded, which is a valid reaction from her side. The family members' pressure adds another layer, as traditional roles might imply that siblings should be in each other's weddings.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often supports the person asserting their autonomy, especially in personal events. The author is not being malicious, just prioritizing their own comfort and the success of their wedding. The sister's behavior is described as problematic, so the author's decision is a self-protective measure. That said, the author might not have communicated their reasons clearly, which could lead to misunderstandings. The sister might not know the full story and feels that she's being excluded without cause. If the author had explained their concerns without blaming the sister, maybe there could be a compromise, like a different role that's less stressful.\n\nBut the author is firm in their decision. In the end, the wedding is the author's day, and they have the right to choose who to include. The sister's mental health issues are a valid concern, so the author isn't in the wrong for making that choice. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
