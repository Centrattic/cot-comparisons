She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, has bipolar disorder with mood swings, and the author believes her presence would overshadow the wedding. The author also mentions not wanting a shower or bachelorette party because of the sister's potential to embarrass them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're planning a significant personal event and want it to be about them. It's their choice who they include in the wedding party. The sister's behavior sounds challenging, and the author is concerned about the sister's mental health affecting the day. The sister is being pushy and others are pressuring the author to include her. The author has valid reasons for their decision, like wanting to avoid a stressful situation and protect their event.\n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics can be complicated. The sister might feel excluded, but the author isn't being cruel; they're making a choice based on their needs. The sister's actions, as described, are self-centered and disruptive. The author isn't excluding her out of malice but to avoid potential issues. The question is whether the author has the right to make this choice despite family pressure.\n\nI think the key points are the author's right to choose their wedding party and the sister's behavior history. The author isn't being inconsiderate but is prioritizing their own well-being. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
