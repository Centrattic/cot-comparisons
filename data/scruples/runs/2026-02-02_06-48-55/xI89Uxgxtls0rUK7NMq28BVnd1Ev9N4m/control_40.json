She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author mentions that their sister constantly demands attention and has bipolar disorder with mania and depression. They're worried that if the sister is in the wedding, it will become about her, either because she's stressed, down, or maybe using drugs. The author didn't want bridesmaids specifically to avoid including her. The sister is upset and others are pressuring the author to include her because she's a sister. The author is also avoiding showers and bachelorette parties to prevent humiliation.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the sister's behavior, the author's reasons for excluding her, and the pressure from others. The author feels it's their day and wants to avoid being overshadowed. The sister's mental health is a factor here. But does the author have a right to exclude her? \n\nOn one hand, the wedding is the author's event, and they should have the final say on who's included. Their concerns about the sister's behavior and mental health are valid if past experiences show she might cause issues. On the other hand, family obligations can be tricky. However, the author isn't forcing the sister to exclude herself; they're making a choice based on their own needs. The sister's actions are making her inclusion problematic. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own comfort and the success of their wedding. The sister's behavior and mental health issues are contributing factors, and the author has the right to set boundaries. Others pressuring them might not understand the sister's tendencies. So the answer is B, No.\n"
