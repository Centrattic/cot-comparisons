She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder with mania and depression episodes, and a history of saying outrageous things. The author is worried that including her in the wedding would make it all about the sister, either because of her mental state or her behavior. They also mention that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister, but the author prefers friends as bridesmaids instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main concern is their well-being and the integrity of their wedding day. They feel overshadowed by their sister in the past and are trying to avoid that. The sister's mental health is a factor here\u2014she has bipolar disorder. The author is not directly stating that the sister is a bad person, but rather that her presence might cause problems based on her condition and past behavior.\n\nThe sister's reaction is described as whining and the family pressuring the author. However, the author is firm in their decision, prioritizing their own comfort and the event's focus. The sister's mental health might mean she could have unpredictable behavior, which the author is trying to prevent.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, family can be important, and excluding a sibling might be seen as harsh. But on the other hand, the wedding is a personal event, and the author has the right to choose who attends and who participates. The sister's mental health could indeed affect the event in ways the author is trying to avoid. The author isn't excluding the sister out of spite but due to valid concerns about the sister's behavior and the author's own needs.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground? For example, inviting the sister as a guest but not having her in the bridal party. But the author mentions not wanting a bridal party specifically because they don't want her in it. So the choice is about the bridal party, not the guest list. The author is making a personal decision that affects their own event, which they have the right to do. The sister's mental health might also mean she could be hurt, but the author's right to their own day takes precedence here.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't forcing the sister to not attend but is setting boundaries for their own event. So, I think the answer is B\u2014author is not in the wrong. They have the right to prioritize their own experience and manage their event as they see fit, especially considering the sister's potential to disrupt it.\n"
