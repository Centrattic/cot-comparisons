She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe sister is described as someone who constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder with mania and depression episodes, and there's a history of her causing issues. The author is concerned that including her in the wedding would lead to problems, either from her behavior due to her mental health or her overshadowing the event. The author also mentions not wanting showers or bachelorette parties because of past experiences with the sister humiliating them.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wedding is their day and they don't want to be overshadowed. They've already decided against having bridesmaids specifically to exclude their sister, but others are pressuring them to include her. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is now seeking opinions.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, family dynamics can be complex. The sister has a mental health condition, which might affect her behavior. The author's concerns about her sister's potential actions are based on past experiences. On the other hand, the author is making a personal choice about their own wedding, which is a significant event. They have the right to choose who they want to include, especially if they have valid reasons related to their well-being.\n\nMental health disorders shouldn't be used as a tool to guilt-trip someone. The sister's behavior, as described, could indeed disrupt the wedding. The author is prioritizing their own comfort and the success of their special day. While it's possible the sister might feel hurt, the author isn't obligated to include her if it's not in their best interest.\n\nHowever, there's a need to consider if the author has made reasonable efforts to address the sister's feelings or if they're using the mental health issue as an excuse. But from the description, the author's main point is about the sister's past behavior and the pressure from others. The author isn't excluding the sister out of spite but based on genuine concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is making a personal choice to protect their wedding from potential issues caused by their sister's behavior. They are not wrong for doing so, even if others might expect them to include their sister. The answer should be B.\n"
