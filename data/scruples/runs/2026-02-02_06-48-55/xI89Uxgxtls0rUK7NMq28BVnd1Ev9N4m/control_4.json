She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister in question has bipolar disorder and tends to draw attention with her behavior, both positive and negative. The author is considering not having bridesmaids to avoid including her sister, and other family members are pressuring them to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main concern is that their sister's presence would overshadow their wedding. The sister's mental health issues could lead to unpredictable behavior. The author is making a choice to protect their own well-being and ensure their day is about them, not their sister. They also mention not wanting a shower or bachelorette party to avoid potential humiliation by the sister.\n\nNow, analyzing the ethics here. Family obligations can be tricky. On one hand, the sister is part of the family, and some might argue you should include your siblings in such an event. But on the other hand, the author has a right to their own wedding experience. The sister's mental health and past behavior are valid concerns. The author's decision is based on personal comfort and mental health, which can be a strong justification.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Others might say that the author is being selfish, but given the sister's history, it's more about self-preservation. The author isn't excluding the sister out of spite but to prevent potential issues. The stress of having a sister who might act out could ruin the wedding, so it's a practical choice.\n\nAlso, the author isn't excluding the sister entirely; they're just not giving her a specific role. They could still attend the wedding but not be a bridesmaid. That distinction is important. The pressure from other family members adds another layer, but the author is prioritizing their own needs, which is understandable.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's often expected to include close family, but there's no hard rule. The author has the right to make choices about their wedding, especially when there are valid concerns. Mental health and past behaviors can justify exclusions if they pose a risk to the event's atmosphere.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a decision to protect their own well-being and the integrity of their special day. The answer should be B.\n"
