She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, has bipolar disorder, and the author is concerned about her behavior during such an important event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's sister has mental health issues, which might affect her behavior at the wedding. The author is choosing not to have bridesmaids specifically to avoid including her sister, even though they didn't explicitly say that. The sister is unhappy and other family members are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nThe main ethical question here is about the right to control one's own wedding. Weddings are personal events, and the person getting married has the final say in who attends and in what roles. The sister's actions in the past could be seen as problematic, so the author's decision to exclude her might be justified to prevent potential issues. However, family members might feel excluded, especially if there's a history of being overshadowed.\n\nMental health is a sensitive issue. The sister's bipolar disorder could lead to unpredictable behavior, which the author is trying to avoid. But is it fair to exclude someone based on potential future behavior? The author is not being hostile, just making a decision to protect their day.\n\nAnother angle is the pressure from other family members. The author might be facing social pressure to include a relative, but the wedding is the author's event. The sister's behavior history adds weight to the author's concerns. The author is also taking steps to prevent problems, like not having a shower or bachelorette party, which shows they're proactive in avoiding situations where the sister might cause issues.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't being mean; they're making a choice to prioritize their own comfort and the success of their wedding. The sister's feelings are important, but the author has the right to decide their own wedding details. The fact that the author has friends they want to include as bridesmaids suggests that personal choice is a factor here.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on past experiences and potential future problems. Their decision is about protecting their own event, which is a common concern in such situations. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
