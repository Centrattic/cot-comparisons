She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention and has bipolar disorder, which causes mood swings. The author is worried that including her in the wedding would lead to her taking over the spotlight, either through stress, depression, or substance use. They also mention that other family members are pressuring them to include the sister. The author chose not to have bridesmaids to avoid including the sister and is avoiding showers and bachelorette parties to prevent her from embarrassing them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's situation. She has a mental health condition, which might affect her behavior. However, the author is concerned about her behavior in the past. The key here is whether the author is justified in excluding her sister based on these concerns. \n\nThe sister is being pressured by family members to be included, but the author's wedding is a personal event. The author has the right to decide who they want to include. However, there's a potential for the sister to feel excluded or hurt, especially given her mental health issues. \n\nThe author mentions that they have friends they would prefer as bridesmaids, so their decision isn't just about excluding the sister but about prioritizing their own comfort. The sister's behavior in past events (humiliating the author) adds weight to the author's decision. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is using the sister's mental health as an excuse to avoid potential conflict. They could be seen as not making an effort to include a family member, even with accommodations. However, the author is clear about their reasons being their own well-being and not wanting to be overshadowed.\n\nI think the author has valid reasons based on their sister's past behavior and the impact on their wedding day. While it's a sensitive situation, the decision to exclude someone to protect one's own event isn't inherently wrong. The sister's mental health complicates things, but the author isn't necessarily the asshole here. They're making a choice about their personal event. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
