She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has mental health issues\u2014bipolar disorder with mania and depression\u2014and a history of seeking attention, sometimes in negative ways. The author is concerned that her sister might overshadow the wedding, either by being stressed, acting out, or using substances. The sister is upset and other family members are pressuring the author to include her. The author has also decided against showers and bachelorette parties to avoid the sister's potential humiliation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's main issue is about personal choice and the right to control their own wedding. Weddings are significant events, and the bride typically has the final say on who attends and participates. The sister's behavior is described as problematic, and there's a valid concern about her mental health affecting the event. However, there might be an underlying assumption here that the author is avoiding responsibility or being selfish by excluding a family member.\n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics can be complex. The sister's mental health is a factor that might require support rather than exclusion. The author's decision could be seen as a way to protect their own mental health and ensure the wedding is about them. However, some might argue that as a sister, the author has a duty to include her, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, the bride has the right to decide who is in her wedding party. The sister's demands and others' pressure might not override that right. The author's reasons are based on past behavior and mental health concerns, which are legitimate personal reasons. The author isn't excluding the sister maliciously but to prevent potential issues on their special day. \n\nHowever, there's a balance between personal boundaries and family obligations. If the sister isn't part of the wedding party, perhaps other family members can include her in a different way. The author isn't necessarily being selfish but prioritizing their own well-being. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often considers both sides. If the sister's behavior is truly disruptive and the author is making a choice to protect themselves, then the author isn't in the wrong. The key is intent and the impact. The author isn't being cruel but making a decision for their own good. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
