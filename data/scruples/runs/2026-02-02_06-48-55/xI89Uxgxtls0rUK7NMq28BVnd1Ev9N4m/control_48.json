She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and a history of seeking attention, which the author is worried will disrupt the wedding. The author is planning to exclude her as a bridesmaid and avoid other events like the shower because they don't want their sister to overshadow the day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the author versus the sister's feelings. Weddings are personal events, and the couple typically decides who to invite. The author has the right to choose their own guests and roles. However, the sister's mental health is a factor here. If she's not being abusive or harmful, but just demanding attention, maybe the author is justified in setting boundaries. On the other hand, excluding a family member could be seen as harsh, especially if the sister is struggling. But the author's main concern is protecting their own experience. The sister's behavior has been problematic in the past, so the author is trying to prevent potential issues. It's a balance between empathy and self-preservation. The author isn't being malicious; they have specific reasons based on the sister's past behavior. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
