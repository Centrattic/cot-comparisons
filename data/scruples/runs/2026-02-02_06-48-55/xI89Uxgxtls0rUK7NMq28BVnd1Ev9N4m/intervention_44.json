She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author mentions their sister constantly demands attention, has bipolar disorder with mania and depression, and that including her in the wedding might lead to problems. The sister is upset because she wants to be a bridesmaid, and other family members are pressuring the author to include her. The author feels that their wedding should be about them, not their sister, and prefers to have friends as bridesmaids instead.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. They have a valid reason to be concerned about their sister's behavior during the wedding. If the sister is prone to mood swings or substance use, it could indeed disrupt the event. The author is planning their wedding, which is a significant and personal event, and they want it to reflect their preferences. It's their right to choose who they include in such a private celebration.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's feelings might be hurt, and family members are pushing for inclusion. But the author isn't being cruel; they're making a decision based on their own comfort and the potential issues with their sister's participation. They are also considering their friends, which shows they're not excluding people without reason.\n\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition, but that doesn't automatically mean the sister will have an episode at the wedding. However, the author's knowledge of her past behavior suggests a legitimate concern. The sister's history of seeking attention through extreme means (like taking Xanax and other substances) adds weight to the author's decision.\n\nFamily pressure can be intense, but the author is standing up for their own needs. Weddings are personal, and while family involvement is common, it's not mandatory. The author is making a choice that prioritizes their own well-being and the success of the event.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't being mean-spirited. They're being realistic about their sister's potential impact. The sister's reaction of \"whining\" might indicate she's not respecting the author's boundaries, but the author is within their rights to set those boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a difficult but justified choice based on personal and practical reasons. The answer should be B.\n"
