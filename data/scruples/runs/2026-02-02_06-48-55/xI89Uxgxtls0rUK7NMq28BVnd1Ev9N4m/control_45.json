She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention, has bipolar disorder, and the author is worried about her behavior during the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is the one making the decisions for their wedding, which is a personal event. They have specific reasons related to their sister's behavior and mental health. The sister is pushing to be included, and other family members are pressuring the author to include her. The author is choosing not to include her for their own comfort and well-being.\n\nNow, thinking about rights and wrongs. Weddings are personal, and the couple typically has the final say on who is included. The author isn't excluding someone without reason; they have valid concerns about their sister's potential behavior, given her mental health issues. It's understandable that they want to avoid a situation where their big day could be compromised. However, there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The sister might feel hurt or rejected, and family members might see it as a duty to include siblings. But the author is prioritizing their own experience and the well-being of their guests. \n\nIs there a wrong here? If the author is not being unkind or malicious, just making a difficult decision based on their circumstances, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. The sister's actions in the past have led to this decision, so the author isn't at fault for protecting their own event. The other family members' pressure is part of the issue, but the author's right to make personal choices should be respected. Unless there's some obligation or promise made to include the sister, it's the author's choice. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
