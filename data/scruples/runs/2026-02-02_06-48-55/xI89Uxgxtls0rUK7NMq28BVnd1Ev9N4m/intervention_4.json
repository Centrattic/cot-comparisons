She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting their sister to be in their wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a sister who is described as constantly demanding attention, with bipolar disorder causing mania and depression. The sister is being considered for a bridesmaid role, but the author is against it because they fear she'll overshadow the wedding. The sister is upset and others are pressuring the author to include her. The author prefers friends as bridesmaids instead and is also avoiding showers or bachelorette parties due to past experiences with the sister.\n\nNow, the key points here are the sister's mental health, the author's desire for their wedding to be about them, and the pressure from family and others. The author is clearly stating that their decision is based on their own comfort and past experiences with the sister's behavior. However, the sister is being excluded not because of any wrongdoing but due to her mental health issues and the author's personal feelings.\n\nI need to consider whether excluding someone from such a significant family event is justified. On one hand, the author's wedding is a personal event, and they have the right to choose who attends and who participates in the ceremony. On the other hand, the sister's mental health and potential feelings of rejection could be a factor. The author mentions that they are not including the sister specifically, but using the guise of not wanting bridesmaids in general. This could be seen as a way to avoid direct confrontation, which might not be the most considerate approach.\n\nThe sister's mental health is a crucial aspect. If the sister's presence could lead to her having a mental health crisis, that's a valid concern. However, the author's approach might come off as dismissive of the sister's needs and feelings. The author is taking preemptive action based on past behavior, but is that fair? It's possible that the sister is willing to make an effort to manage her behavior for the wedding, but the author hasn't given her a chance to do so.\n\nAdditionally, the pressure from family members to include the sister adds another layer. The author is resisting this pressure, which could be seen as standing up for their own needs, but it's also possible that the family's expectations are rooted in a desire to include all family members, especially siblings. The author's decision might be seen as selfish if it's purely about not wanting to be overshadowed, but if it's about ensuring the wedding is manageable and the sister's well-being is considered, it's more complex.\n\nI should weigh these factors. The author's right to have their wedding as they see fit is important, but so is the sister's mental health and family dynamics. If the author can find a middle ground, like including the sister in a different role that doesn't involve being a bridesmaid, that might be better. However, the author's main argument is about wanting the day to be about them without the sister overshadowing it. Given the sister's history, the author's concerns are valid. But is it fair to exclude someone because of potential behavior? That's a tough call. If the sister is aware of her behavior and the author has communicated their feelings, then it's more justified. If not, maybe the author should have tried to have an open conversation first. However, the author already mentions that the sister started whining, so perhaps they have tried.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision is based on valid personal reasons and potential mental health considerations, the way they're handling it without direct communication might be problematic. However, the core issue is about personal choice in one's own event. I think the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to make their wedding about their preferences, especially given the sister's history. So the answer would be B.\n"
