She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has bipolar disorder and tends to demand attention, which the author feels has overshadowed them in the past. The author is considering not having bridesmaids to avoid including the sister but is being pressured by family members to let her be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's mental health is a factor here. Bipolar disorder can involve mood swings, which might affect her behavior at events. The author is concerned about her sister's potential to cause stress or disruption during the wedding. On the other hand, the sister is feeling left out and is being persistent, while family members are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nThe author's primary reason is personal comfort and the desire to have their wedding about them. They mention friends they'd prefer to have as bridesmaids instead. The sister's behavior history is given as a justification for not wanting her involved. The author also avoids showers and bachelorette parties due to the sister's possible humiliation of them in front of friends and future sister-in-law.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the wedding is the author's event, and they generally have the right to choose their guests and participants. However, family expectations can complicate this, especially when there's a history of conflict. The sister's mental health might be a valid concern, but it's also important to consider how the author is handling the situation. Did they communicate their reasons honestly? The author didn't directly tell the sister why they didn't want her involved, which might come off as being evasive or not fully transparent. The sister's insistence on being part of the wedding could be due to her own feelings of exclusion or a desire to feel important, which might be a result of her mental health struggles.\n\nI need to weigh the author's right to autonomy against the sister's emotional needs and the family's expectations. The author's reasoning is based on past experiences and a desire to avoid a stressful situation, which is understandable. However, the approach of not being upfront might exacerbate family tensions. It's possible that the sister could feel hurt or rejected, but the author is prioritizing their own well-being on a significant day. \n\nThere's also the aspect of mental health. If the sister is in a manic or depressive episode, it could indeed affect the wedding. The author might be acting in self-preservation. That said, excluding a family member without clear communication can lead to misunderstandings. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to exclude someone who has caused them distress, especially if they've tried to set boundaries before. But the way they're handling the situation\u2014like not being direct\u2014might be part of the problem.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often whether the person acted with consideration for others. The author is trying to protect themselves, which is valid, but the sister's feelings are also important. If the author can find a compromise, like a smaller role without being a bridesmaid, that might be better. But as it stands, the author is choosing their own comfort over family inclusion, which is a common dilemma. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific family dynamics. However, without more context, the author's decision seems reasonable given their stated reasons, even if the sister is upset. The sister's behavior history is a legitimate concern, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
