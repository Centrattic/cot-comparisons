She says outrageous things to draw (even negative) attention to herself. She is bipolar and experiences bouts of mania and depression. I know if she's in my wedding it will somehow be all about her - either she's so stressed out or she's feeling so down or she didn't get any sleep so she's drugged up on Xanax and twelve other things, etc.\n\nI told her I was planning on not having bridesmaids (specifically because I DON'T want her in my wedding, but obviously I didn't say this) and she started whining about how she has never been in a wedding and it's important for her to be in mine. Other family members have also lectured me about how I *have* to let her stand up there with me because she's my sister. \n\nI think it's so unfair for me to be forced to include her on what is supposed to be MY day, the one time in my life where she can't overshadow me or make the day all about her. I have friends who I would love to have as bridesmaids, but I'm not because I don't want her having anything to do with my wedding. I've already told everyone I don't want a shower or bachelorette party because I know she will humiliate me in front of my friends and future sister-in-law. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to let her have a role in my wedding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their sister in their wedding. The sister has a history of demanding attention and has bipolar disorder, which causes her to act out during events. The author is worried that including her in the wedding will lead to chaos and that the day will focus on the sister instead of the author. The author has friends they'd rather have as bridesmaids but are avoiding the sister because of this. The sister is upset and other family members are pressuring the author to include her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main concern is their own well-being and the success of their wedding day. They have valid reasons based on the sister's past behavior and mental health issues. The sister's actions have historically overshadowed the author, and the author feels that excluding her is necessary to prevent a negative impact on the wedding.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel hurt and excluded. The family members are pressuring the author, suggesting that there's a social expectation to include a sibling. However, the author is making a personal choice about whose role in their wedding day. Weddings are personal, and the author has the right to choose who participates, especially if someone's presence could cause issues.\n\nThe sister's mental health is a factor here. If her behaviors are due to bipolar disorder, maybe there's a need for understanding. But the author isn't being unkind; they're making a decision to protect their own day. The author is also considering the potential for the sister's actions to affect the event negatively. It's a balance between family obligations and personal needs.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the common thread is about respect and justification. The author isn't being malicious; they have legitimate concerns. While it's unfortunate that the sister feels excluded, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own event. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
