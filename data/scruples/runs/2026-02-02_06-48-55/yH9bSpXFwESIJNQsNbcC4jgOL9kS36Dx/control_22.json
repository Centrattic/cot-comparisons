In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after he got angry during a phone call.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend despite being busy and broke. She made several accommodations, like changing the time, and emphasized the effort she put in. The brother was late, which she expected, but then he yelled at her during a call, which she found unacceptable. She hung up and told him not to come over. He was nearby, but it was cold and raining, so he left, got wet, turned back, and went home. Now he's upset and thinks she should apologize for turning him away in the cold. She's defensive, saying his behavior was worse.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Let's break it down. The sister did go out of her way to prepare the meal despite her busy schedule and financial constraints. She communicated her expectations about the time and the effort involved. The brother, however, was disrespectful by shouting at her, which she rightly found unacceptable. His response was to yell and then not apologize properly. She felt justified in cutting off the invitation because of his behavior, especially after he had been rude.\n\nBut then there's the part where he was in the cold and wet. She turned him away, which he's now using as a point against her. However, his initial disrespectful behavior was the trigger for her decision. She didn't want to invite someone who was abusive, even if that person was her brother. The sister's main issue was the disrespect, not the inconvenience of him being late. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have handled the situation differently. For example, after he yelled, she might have considered waiting a bit longer or offering a solution. But given the context of him being disrespectful, her decision to revoke the invitation seems reasonable. The brother's actions were inconsiderate and rude, which gave her a valid reason to change her mind. \n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations and the escalation caused by his yelling. The sister's effort and the brother's disrespect are central. She was within her rights to prioritize her comfort and safety in the situation, especially after being disrespected. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
