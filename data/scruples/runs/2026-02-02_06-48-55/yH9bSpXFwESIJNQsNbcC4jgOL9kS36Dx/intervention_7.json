In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the sister cooking dinner for her brother and his girlfriend, but he ends up being late, they get into an argument over the phone, and she ends up turning him away when he arrives late, in the rain.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The sister agreed to cook lunch after initially hesitating because of her busy schedule and financial constraints. She made arrangements for 6 PM, but the brother asked for 6:30 instead. She warned him not to be late. When he was late, he called her a \"prick\" and she hung up. Then he showed up after 7:30, and she didn't let him in, leading to the roast dinner being wasted.\n\nNow, the sister's perspective: She put in a lot of effort, planned around his potential lateness, but felt disrespected when he shouted at her. She stood by her decision not to apologize, thinking that his disrespectful behavior was worse than her turning him away in the rain.\n\nThe brother's side: He was running late due to the bus, which he explained. He apologized in a non-apologetic way, but he believes she's in the wrong for not letting him in after he came all that way in bad weather.\n\nSo, who's at fault? Well, the sister had the right to set boundaries, especially after being disrespected. She had communicated her expectations and was clear about her efforts. The brother's shouting was unprovoked and inappropriate, regardless of their relationship. However, she did hang up and sent a harsh message, which might be seen as a bit over the top, but maybe forgivable given the disrespect. Then, when he arrived late, she turned him away. But she had already made it clear that she wasn't okay with his behavior. \n\nI think the key here is the brother's disrespectful behavior. He escalated the situation by shouting at her, which justified her cutting off the conversation. The sister's decision to not let him in might seem harsh, but considering the prior interaction, she had a reason to stand her ground. The brother's insistence that she should apologize and that he shouldn't have been turned away seems to miss the point of his own disrespectful actions.\n\nHowever, maybe the sister could have handled it differently. Instead of cutting him off completely, perhaps she could have cooled down and discussed it more calmly. But given that he was already late and then disrespectful, her actions are more about self-respect. The brother's behavior initiated the conflict, so the sister isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister did make a meal for him, which was a kind gesture, and turning him away after he arrived (even if late) might have been a bit extreme. But if she felt that his disrespect made it untenable to let him in, maybe she had a point. \n\nI think the main issue here is the brother's conduct when he called her a prick. That's a major red flag in any relationship. The sister's reaction was to protect her own dignity. So, in that context, the brother's behavior was worse. Therefore, the sister isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground where both could take responsibility. The sister might have overreacted slightly by hanging up and sending a harsh message, but the brother's behavior was the catalyst. \n\nConsidering all that, I lean towards the sister not being in the wrong. The answer is B (No). The brother's disrespectful actions triggered her response, and she had a right to set boundaries.\n"
