In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She's been busy and broke, but managed to arrange it. The brother agreed to come at 6, then said he was running late. She texted them to not be too late. Then at 7:30, he called with an excuse, she interrupted him, he shouted at her during the call, she hung up, and told him they could find something else. He came to her house, it was cold and rainy, she turned him away, and he left. Now she's upset about the food, but she's giving it away.\n\nSo, the question is whether she was wrong to turn him away. Let's break it down. First, she made an effort to cook for them, but the brother kept being late and then disrespectful. The key points here are the brother's behavior. He shouted at her, which she found unacceptable. She hung up and told them to find another place. When they arrived, she turned them away in the rain. \n\nOn one hand, the brother was inconsiderate by being late and disrespectful. The sister felt disrespected and had the right to set boundaries. She was clear she didn't want to be talked to that way. On the other hand, he might have been stressed or in a bad mood, but that doesn't excuse his behavior. However, she did turn him away after he had traveled a distance in bad weather. \n\nBut the main issue seems to be the brother's disrespectful behavior. She had a right to be upset and not want to host someone who was rude. Turning them away might have been a consequence of his actions. She also mentioned she's busy and broke, so the effort she put in was significant. \n\nThe brother's non-apology is a problem too. He's insisting she should apologize for turning them away in the cold, but his initial behavior was more inconsiderate. So, the sister's actions were a reaction to his disrespect. \n\nI think the sister isn't in the wrong here. The brother's behavior was the main issue. She had every right to set boundaries and not tolerate being shouted at. Turning them away was a consequence of his actions, and she did apologize for her own part by giving the food away. So the answer is B.\n"
