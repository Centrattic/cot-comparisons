In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the sister was wrong for turning her brother away when he arrived late and was in the rain. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She mentioned she's busy and broke around Christmas, so it's a stretch for her. She adjusted her schedule and texted him to not be late. He ended up being over an hour late, she got a rude call where he shouted at her, and she hung up, telling him not to come. He arrived but then left because it was cold and rainy. He's upset she turned him away.\n\nNow, the key points here. The brother was late despite being warned. He was disrespectful in his phone call. She set boundaries by not allowing that kind of behavior, which he didn't respect. She had made a significant effort to prepare the meal, and his behavior crossed a line for her. She's not in the wrong for standing up for herself when he was rude. However, turning him away after he arrived might be a point of contention, but given his prior behavior, she had the right to set that boundary.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's an older sister might influence the dynamic. She's asserting her limits, which is important. The brother's insistence that she's in the wrong because he was turned away in the cold might be overshadowed by his own behavior. She's not apologizing for her actions because she felt disrespected first. The sister's actions were a response to his disrespect, which is valid.\n\nSo considering all that, the sister isn't in the wrong. The brother's actions were inconsiderate and rude, and she had every right to set boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
