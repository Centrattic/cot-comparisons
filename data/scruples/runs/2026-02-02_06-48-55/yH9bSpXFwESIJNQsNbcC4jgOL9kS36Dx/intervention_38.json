In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain after an argument. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend despite being busy and broke. She made arrangements, emphasized the timing, and the brother was late. When she got angry and hung up, he was nearby but ended up not showing up, leading to her turning him away in the weather.\n\nThe sister's perspective: She felt disrespected when he shouted at her. She stood her ground, which led to him not coming. She's upset about the wasted food but stands by her decision.\n\nThe brother's side isn't fully known, but he claims she shouldn't have talked over him and is now asking for an apology. He thinks turning him away in the cold is worse than his outburst.\n\nFactors to consider: The sister had the right to set boundaries. Being shouted at is disrespectful, and she reacted to protect her own comfort. However, she could have handled the situation differently, like letting him come even if it was late. But given the disrespect and the fact that she was already stressed, her reaction might be understandable.\n\nThe brother's behavior was inappropriate. Yelling and not apologizing properly contributed to the conflict. The sister's decision to prioritize her peace of mind might be justified. However, turning him away in the cold could be seen as harsh, even if he was at fault. There's a middle ground, like letting him come but setting clear boundaries.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The sister isn't entirely in the wrong because she was defending her respect and effort. The brother also isn't blameless for his outburst. But the sister's action of turning him away could be seen as a consequence of their conflict. However, given that he was already nearby and the weather was bad, maybe she could have found a compromise. Still, her stance on respecting her own boundaries is valid. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer leans towards her not being entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. The key is whether the sister's actions were a reasonable response to the disrespect she faced. Since the brother's behavior escalated the situation, her reaction is more defensible. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
