In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is an older sister who cooked a meal for her brother and his girlfriend. She was already stressed because of the holidays, money issues, and a busy schedule. She adjusted her plans to accommodate the lunch, even after her brother changed the time.\n\nThen, when her brother was late, she got a call where he was shouting at her. She felt disrespected and hung up. She told him he shouldn't expect her to cook for someone who treats her that way. He went to her house but had to turn back because of the weather, and she refused to let him in. Now he's upset and wants her to apologize.\n\nFirst, communication issues: the brother was late before, but this time he was rude. The sister set boundaries and stood her ground. Being shouted at is not okay, especially from someone she's supposed to be close to. She made it clear she wouldn't tolerate that behavior, which is reasonable.\n\nShe also had the right to be upset about the wasted food and her effort. She's in a financial tight spot, so cooking a big meal was a sacrifice. When he showed up late and she turned him away, it was because of the prior disrespect. She's not in the wrong for protecting her own feelings and setting boundaries.\n\nThe brother's actions were inconsiderate, but his insistence that she should apologize seems like he's not taking responsibility for his own part. The sister's response was about respecting herself. So, the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
