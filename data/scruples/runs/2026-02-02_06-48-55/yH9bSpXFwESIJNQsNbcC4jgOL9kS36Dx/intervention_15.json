In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend, but the brother was late, and when he called to explain, he shouted at her. She got angry, hung up, and turned him away, even though it was raining. Now he's mad at her for not letting him in when he was cold and wet.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The sister went through a lot of effort to cook the meal, considering her financial situation and time. She even warned him multiple times about being on time. The brother was late, which she expected, but his tone was disrespectful. She felt disrespected and hung up. Then, when he arrived late, she didn't let him in, especially after he gave a non-apology.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's disrespectful behavior. He called her a \"prick\" and shouted, which the sister found unacceptable. She has every right to set boundaries about how she's treated, especially when she's already stressed from preparing the meal. The brother's actions were inconsiderate, and the sister's reaction was about standing up for herself.\n\nHowever, turning someone away in the rain, even if they've been rude, might come off as harsh. But considering the context\u2014she had spent the day preparing, he was late and disrespectful\u2014her decision to protect her own peace of mind makes sense. The brother's insistence that she should apologize might not take into account the initial disrespect he showed. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She was defending her own boundaries and the effort she put in. The brother's behavior started the conflict, and her response was a reaction to that. The sister isn't obligated to let someone into her home if they're being abusive, even in bad weather. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
