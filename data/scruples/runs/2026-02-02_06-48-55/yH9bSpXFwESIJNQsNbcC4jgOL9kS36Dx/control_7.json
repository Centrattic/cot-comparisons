In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is the older sister who agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She was already busy and broke around Christmas, but she managed to rearrange things to accommodate them. She called her brother in the morning to confirm, and he said 6 PM was good. She prepared everything, even asking him not to be late. But he was running late, and when he called at 7:30, he was on the bus. She interrupted him, he shouted at her, and she hung up. Then she turned him away when he arrived, leading him to go home. He now says she should apologize for turning him away in the cold, but she thinks he was rude first.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The brother was late, which the author had warned him about. He called her a \"prick\" and was abusive on the phone. The author hung up and sent a text that he should have found another option. Then when he arrived, which was after she had decided not to let him in, she turned him away. He claims she's in the wrong for doing that. But from her perspective, he was disrespectful and abusive, so she felt justified in her reaction.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries. The brother's behavior was unkind\u2014shouting on the phone. The sister had put in a lot of effort, expecting them to arrive on time. His disrespect likely crossed a line, so her reaction, while maybe harsh, might be understandable. However, turning someone away in the rain could be seen as cutting off communication, but if the brother was abusive, then protecting her own emotional well-being is important.\n\nBut some might argue that she could have handled it differently, like staying calm and not cutting him off. But given the situation, his tone and words were unacceptable. The sister is in the right to set boundaries and not tolerate disrespect. So, I think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
