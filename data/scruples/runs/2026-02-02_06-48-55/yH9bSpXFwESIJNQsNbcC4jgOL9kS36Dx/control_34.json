In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author turning away their brother after he was late and got angry during a phone call. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author initially agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend, even after hesitating due to being busy and broke during Christmas. She made efforts to adjust her schedule and even warned him about being late. The brother ended up being an hour late, and when she tried to ask when he'd arrive, he yelled at her. She hung up and told him not to come over. It was raining, and he ended up being cold and left.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's upset about the disrespect shown during the conversation. She stood up for herself by hanging up and not apologizing. The brother is upset that she turned him away in the cold. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author made an effort to accommodate her brother, but he was late and disrespectful. She had a right to set boundaries, especially if his behavior was unacceptable. However, turning someone away in the rain might seem harsh. But the brother's yelling is a significant factor. The author's response is about self-respect and not tolerating disrespectful behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled the situation differently, like staying on the phone to calm things down or offering an alternative. But given the brother's outburst, her reaction is understandable. The brother's insistence that turning him away is worse than his outburst is questionable. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She set boundaries after being disrespected. The brother's behavior was worse. So the answer would be B.\n"
