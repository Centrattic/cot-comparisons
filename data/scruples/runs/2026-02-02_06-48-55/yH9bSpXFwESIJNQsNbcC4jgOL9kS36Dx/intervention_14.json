In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after he was late and got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend despite being busy and broke around Christmas. She adjusted her schedule, made the food, and set a time. The brother was late, then got angry and shouted at her. She hung up, told him not to come, and he ended up going home in the rain. The sister is now defensive, saying she won't apologize, while the brother insists she's in the wrong for turning him away.\n\nFrom her perspective, she put in a lot of effort, was respected when she asked for punctuality, and felt disrespected when he shouted. She stood her ground, which is understandable given the disrespect. However, turning him away in the rain might seem harsh, especially since he was already cold and wet. The brother's behavior was inappropriate, but the sister's response might have been over the top.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's initial actions\u2014being late and yelling\u2014were disrespectful and inconsiderate. The sister had every right to feel upset and set a boundary. However, refusing to let him come over, even after he apologized (albeit poorly), could be seen as not being forgiving. The sister's justification is that she doesn't want to be around someone who talks to her that way, which is valid. But the brother's suffering in the rain is a counterpoint.\n\nThe key factors are mutual respect and boundaries. The sister's anger is justified due to the disrespect, but her action of turning him away might be seen as punitive beyond what was necessary. However, given the context of the brother's behavior, she might have felt it was necessary to protect her own well-being. The sister's decision to donate the food shows she's trying to make amends, but the situation is still tense.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the sister's reaction was proportionate. While the brother was wrong to yell, the sister's response might have been too severe. However, considering the disrespect he showed, her actions could be seen as a reasonable boundary-setting. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the sister not being in the wrong because she was defending her own respect and effort. So, answer B (No).\n"
