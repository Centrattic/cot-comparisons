In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning away their brother after he got angry.\n\nFirst, the sister offered to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She was already busy and broke but still agreed after some back and forth. She prepared the meal, asked him to be on time because she knew he'd be late, and he ended up arriving way past the agreed time. Then, when she tried to get an update, he shouted at her, which she found completely unacceptable. She hung up, told him to find another place, and he ended up turning back in the rain.\n\nThe brother claims she was wrong to turn him away in the cold, but she argues that his disrespectful behavior was worse. The key points here are about respect and boundaries. She set the terms initially, and he violated her boundaries by being late and using aggressive language. She felt disrespected and chose to cut off the interaction. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she did invite him, but after he broke her conditions and was rude. She had the right to set her limits. Turning him away was a response to his disrespect, not just because he was late. Also, she even considered giving the food away to a good cause, which shows she wasn't acting out of spite but was upset about the wasted meal. \n\nThe brother's argument that turning him away in the cold is worse than his outburst seems to minimize his own behavior. She stood up for herself, which is important in any relationship. So, she's justified in her actions. Answer B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
