In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's brother asked for a cooked lunch. The author was already stressed because it's close to Christmas and she's broke and busy. She agreed to do it after some back and forth. She texts the brother asking not to be late, and he ends up being late. Then, when she calls him at 7:30, he yells at her and says \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK.\" The author is upset, hangs up, and tells him he should find something else if he's going to treat her that way. The brother then comes to the house but leaves in the rain, and they argue again. The brother says she should apologize for turning him away in the cold, but she's not apologizing.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether she was wrong to turn him away. Let's break it down. First, she made an effort to cook the meal and asked him not to be late. He was late, which she expected, but when she confronted him, he was rude. She felt disrespected and hung up. Then, when he arrived, she turned him away. \n\nI think she has a point about not wanting to be spoken to that way. If someone is rude to you, it's understandable to set boundaries. But maybe she could have handled it differently. Like, if he showed up, maybe she could have let him in but still expressed her anger. The fact that he was in the cold and wet might make her choice seem harsh. But on the other hand, he was disrespectful first. \n\nThe brother's reaction to her being late and then the yelling might have escalated the situation. The author was in a vulnerable position financially and busy, so the stress is valid. However, turning someone away in the rain could be seen as cutting off a family member, which might be harsh. But she was standing up for herself, which is important. \n\nI think the key points are: the brother was disrespectful first, she had already put a lot of effort into the meal, and her reaction was to protect her own feelings. But maybe she could have handled it more calmly. Still, given the context, it's a bit of a toss-up. Some people might say she's in the right for standing up for herself, while others might think she shouldn't have turned him away. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because she was disrespected and had the right to set boundaries. But I can see arguments for A too, like maybe she could have been more forgiving or found another solution. The fact that the food went to waste adds to her stress, but it's not about the food\u2014it's about how she was treated. So, I think B is the answer here.\n"
