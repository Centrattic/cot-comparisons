In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend after some back and forth. She was busy and broke but still made the effort. She communicated the time and emphasized not being late. The brother was running late, which is common for him, but she had planned accordingly. Then at 7:30, he called, still on the bus. She interrupted to ask when he'd arrive, and he yelled at her. She hung up and told him he shouldn't inconvenience her like that. He ended up not showing up, got cold and wet, and she turned him away. Now he's upset and says she should apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did she have the right to be upset about his outburst? He was rude, which she clearly found unacceptable. She set boundaries, which is reasonable. He broke the agreed time, and when confronted, he responded with aggression. Her reaction to that aggression is understandable\u2014she stood her ground and ended the interaction. \n\nOn the other hand, he did show up in the rain, but she didn't let him in because of the earlier conflict. But the core issue is his disrespectful behavior. The sister had every right to feel disrespected and to make her boundaries clear. Her actions were a response to his poor behavior, not just the lateness. \n\nHe's insisting she should apologize, but he didn't acknowledge his part in the conflict. The sister's main issue was how he spoke to her, which is valid. She's not in the wrong for protecting her own boundaries and not tolerating abuse. The food being wasted is a side point; it's about her emotional response to the situation.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong. She had a right to be upset and set boundaries. The brother's disrespectful behavior was the root cause, and she's justified in her response.\n"
