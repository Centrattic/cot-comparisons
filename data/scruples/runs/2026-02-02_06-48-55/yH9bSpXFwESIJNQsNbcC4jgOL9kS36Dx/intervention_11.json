In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The author is an older sister who agreed to cook a meal for her brother and his girlfriend. She mentions that she's been broke and busy during the holiday season, which probably added stress. The brother, however, kept being late, which the author had anticipated but still ended up being a problem. The key issue here is the brother's outburst where he shouted at her, calling her a \"prick\" and the sister hanging up and turning him away in the rain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The sister put in effort to cook a meal, adjusted her schedule, and communicated her expectations clearly. When the brother was late, she was understanding but set boundaries. The brother's response was aggressive, which the sister found unacceptable. His use of harsh language crossed a line, especially since they are family. The sister felt disrespected and chose to cut off communication, leading to him getting wet and cold.\n\nFrom the sister's side, she was in a vulnerable position financially and emotionally. She made accommodations for her brother, but his behavior was disrespectful. It's reasonable for her to expect respect when she's put in so much effort. Turning him away might seem harsh, but given the context of being shouted at and not wanting to engage with someone who disrespects her, it's a self-respecting response.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's behavior was inconsiderate. He was aware of his sister's situation but still arrived late, causing her stress. His outburst was unprovoked, and his non-apology suggests he doesn't take responsibility. However, he might have been under stress or didn't realize the impact of his actions. The sister's decision to not apologize could be seen as holding a grudge, but given the context, it's about setting boundaries.\n\nThe author's actions were a reaction to disrespect. While turning someone away in the rain isn't ideal, the brother's behavior justified her actions. The sister's main issue is the lack of respect, not the inconvenience of the meal. She's also considering donating the food, showing she's trying to make the best of the situation. The key here is that the sister's actions were a response to disrespect, and the brother's actions were the root cause. Therefore, the sister isn't in the wrong.\n"
