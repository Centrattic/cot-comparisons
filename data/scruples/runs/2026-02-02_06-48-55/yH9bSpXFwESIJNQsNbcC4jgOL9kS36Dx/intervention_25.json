In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author prepared a meal, communicated the time, and was clear about their efforts. The brother was late, got angry, and shouted. The author felt disrespected and hung up. Then the brother was in the area but went home, and he's now upset about the author turning him away after he came back.\n\nThe author's actions: They were stressed, had a lot of work, and were trying to manage their time. The brother's behavior was disrespectful, which is a valid reason to cut off the conversation. However, turning someone away in the rain might seem harsh. But considering the brother's attitude, maybe it was a justified reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother did show up later, but maybe the author could have let him in once he arrived. But the author had already made their point by then. The brother's non-apology complicates things. \n\nThe key points are mutual disrespect and communication issues. The author had a right to set boundaries, especially after being shouted at. But turning someone away in bad weather might be seen as unkind. However, the brother's actions first led to the conflict. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were the ones who were disrespected. But maybe they could have handled the situation better after the brother arrived. However, since the brother went home and came back, the author's decision to not let him in might be seen as a consequence of his actions. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
