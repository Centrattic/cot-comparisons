In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a sister turning away her brother after he was late and rude during a phone call.\n\nFirst, the sister had agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend, even though she was busy and broke. She made arrangements for a specific time, warned him about the lateness, and he ended up being an hour late. When she called to check, he was rude, shouting at her. She hung up and told him he shouldn't inconvenience her like that. He then went to her house but was already cold and wet, turned back, and gave a non-apology.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. The sister set up the time, made clear her needs, and had warnings about his lateness. She even adjusted her cooking schedule based on past experiences. So she had a valid expectation of punctuality.\n\n2. The brother was late again, despite being warned. When confronted, he was verbally abusive. The sister's reaction of hanging up and refusing to let him in might be justified because of his disrespectful behavior. It's important to note that she didn't want to associate with someone who talks to her like that.\n\n3. The brother now claims that being turned away in the rain is worse than his rude behavior. But the sister's stance is that being shouted at is unacceptable, which seems reasonable. The brother's non-apology complicates things.\n\n4. The sister's actions were a response to his disrespect. Even if she could have been more forgiving, her boundaries around how she's treated are valid. However, some might argue that she could have handled the situation differently, like staying calm and not turning him away, but given the context of being shouted at, her reaction is understandable.\n\n5. The sister's mention of being upset about the leftover food shows she didn't want to waste it, but she's also considering donating it, which is a positive action. The brother's insistence on an apology might be because he's not taking responsibility for his part in the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the brother's initial behavior (being late and rude) set the stage for the sister's reaction. While her decision to turn him away might be seen as harsh, her boundaries around respect are crucial. It's a balance between accountability for his actions and her right to set limits. Ultimately, the sister's actions might be seen as justified given the disrespect she faced, so the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
