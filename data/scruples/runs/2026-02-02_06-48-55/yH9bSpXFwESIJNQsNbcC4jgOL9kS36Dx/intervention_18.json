In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain after a conflict over a delayed lunch invitation.\n\nFirst, the author initially agreed to cook for her brother despite being busy and broke. She made arrangements, sent reminders, and even adjusted her schedule. The brother then arrived late, and when confronted, he shouted at her. The author felt disrespected and hung up, leading to the brother leaving in the rain and not showing up. The author is upset about the wasted food and the brother's insistence that she's wrong.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the key points are the brother's disrespectful behavior. The author had put in significant effort and communicated her expectations. When he was late and used harsh language, she stood her ground. It's important to note that mutual respect is crucial in any relationship. The brother's outburst seems to be the immediate trigger, and the author's reaction was a response to being disrespected. While turning someone away might seem harsh, the context of the disrespect is important. The brother's non-apology and insistence on the author being wrong could indicate a lack of accountability on his part. The author's decision to prioritize her feelings and the respect she deserved is understandable. On the other hand, she might have considered alternative solutions, like letting him come later or sharing the food. But given the disrespect shown, her reaction could be seen as justified. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the brother's actions were disrespectful, and the author had a right to set boundaries.\n"
