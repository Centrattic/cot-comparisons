In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the sister) is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after he yelled at her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend after some back and forth about her being busy and broke during Christmas. She made a plan for 6 PM but warned him not to be late. He was late, and when she asked about his arrival time, he yelled at her. She hung up and told him not to come over, which he did, but then left because it was cold and rainy, and turned back home. She's upset about the food and the situation. The brother is insisting she should apologize, but she's not willing to, thinking her actions were justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's behavior. He was late, and when she asked a question, he shouted an insult. The sister felt disrespected and hung up. Then, when he arrived, she turned him away. The question is whether her reaction was wrong.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she put in a lot of effort, and the brother's yelling crossed a line. She didn't want to interact with someone who disrespected her. The brother, on the other hand, might feel that even though he was rude, she overreacted by turning him away in bad weather. \n\nNow, considering the cultural context, in many cases, family dynamics play a role. The sister is older, so there might be expectations of her being more accommodating. However, mutual respect is important in any relationship. Yelling isn't acceptable, and the sister has a right to set boundaries. \n\nThe brother's lack of a proper apology and his insistence that she should apologize might indicate he's not taking her feelings seriously. The sister's decision to not let him in after such a disrespectful call seems justified, especially since she felt disrespected. The brother's choice to come anyway, knowing the weather was bad, might reflect a lack of consideration on his part as well. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The sister could have handled the situation differently, maybe by staying calm and not cutting him off entirely. But given the context of the brother's behavior, her actions are understandable. \n\nIn terms of who's more in the wrong, the brother's disrespectful behavior is a significant issue. The sister's response, while perhaps a bit harsh, was a reaction to being treated poorly. The key is whether the sister's actions were an overreaction. She was under stress, had put in effort, and was met with disrespect. Her choice to prioritize her comfort and not tolerate the disrespect seems reasonable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the sister isn't necessarily in the wrong. The brother's actions were more disrespectful, and she had the right to set boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
