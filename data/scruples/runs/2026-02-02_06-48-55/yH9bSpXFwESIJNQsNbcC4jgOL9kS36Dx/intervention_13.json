In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend after some back and forth because she was busy and broke. She emphasized not being late, but he ended up being late. Then, when he called to explain, he shouted at her, which she found unacceptable. She hung up and told him not to come. He ended up going to her house but left because it was raining, then turned back and went home. Now, she's upset about the wasted food and he says she's wrong to turn him away.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The sister put in a lot of effort, prepared the meal, asked for promptness, and was respectful. Her brother, however, was late, disrespectful, and didn't apologize properly. The sister felt disrespected and decided not to let him come over. The brother claims that being turned away in the cold is worse than his harsh words.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she was clear about her boundaries. She warned him about the lateness and then faced a disrespectful outburst. Her reaction was to protect her own comfort and not to engage with someone who disrespected her. She didn't want to spend the evening with someone who talked to her like that. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother might feel that his sister overreacted. But given that she had already invested time and money into cooking, and he was both late and disrespectful, her decision to stand her ground is understandable. The key here is the mutual respect. If someone treats you with contempt, it's reasonable to set boundaries. \n\nThe sister didn't immediately turn him away when he arrived; he was already there and left because it was cold. She didn't open the door again. Her actions were a result of the earlier disrespect. The brother's behavior was the initial problem here. \n\nConsidering all this, the sister's actions seem justified. She was protecting her own boundaries and the effort she put into the meal. The brother's disrespect was the root cause. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
