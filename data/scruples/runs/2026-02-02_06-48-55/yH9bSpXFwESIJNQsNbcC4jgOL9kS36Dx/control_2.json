In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister cooked lunch for her brother and his girlfriend, but he was late and ended up being rude on the phone. She hung up on him and turned him away in the rain.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The sister was already stressed because she's broke and busy around Christmas. She made time and effort to cook despite her constraints. Her brother, on the other hand, kept changing the time and was late. The sister asked him to be on time, but he was running late again. Then, when she asked when he'd arrive, he shouted at her. She felt disrespected and hung up. He later came over, it was raining, and she turned him away. He's upset about that, but she's not apologizing.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the brother did come to her house, which is about a half-hour trip. He might have expected her to let him in despite the weather. But he was also rude first. The sister had a right to be upset about the disrespect. She did warn him about the timing and even adjusted her plans because she knew he might be late. When he showed up late and had already shouted at her, she decided not to let him in. \n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations. The sister put in a lot of effort, and the brother's behavior was disrespectful. She had the right to set boundaries. Turning him away in the rain might seem harsh, but given his prior behavior, she was protecting her own peace of mind. The problem is that the brother is now insistent she's wrong, but the sister stands by her actions. \n\nI think the sister is justified in her actions. She didn't have to let him in, especially after his rude comments. The brother's expectation that she should let him in despite his lateness and disrespect isn't fair. The sister's priority was her own well-being and comfort, which is valid. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
