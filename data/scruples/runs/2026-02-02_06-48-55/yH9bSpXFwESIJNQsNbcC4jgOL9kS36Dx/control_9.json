In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's brother asked for lunch, and the author agreed after some back and forth. The author made plans, bought food, and texted to warn the brother not to be late. The brother was late, the author was okay with that, but then when the brother called at 7:30, he was still on the bus. The author interrupted him, and he shouted at her. She hung up and sent a text saying he could find something better. The brother then went to her house but turned back, and now he's saying she should apologize for turning him away in the rain. She thinks she's not in the wrong, but the brother insists.\n\nFirst, the brother's behavior: he yelled at her. The author says their relationship isn't one where that's normal. The brother's use of \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\" seems aggressive. The author hung up and texted him, which might be seen as cutting him off when he's already en route. But the brother's initial disrespect might justify her reaction. \n\nThe brother then went to her house in the rain, only to turn back. The author didn't let him in after he arrived, which he's now holding against her. The key here is the escalation of the conflict. The brother's yelling was unprovoked and disrespectful, so the author's response might be justified. She set boundaries after being disrespected, which is reasonable. However, turning him away after he made the effort to come, even in bad weather, could be seen as harsh, but considering the prior incident, maybe it's not her fault. \n\nThe author might feel wronged because of the brother's tone, and the brother is now blaming her for not letting him in. The author's main issue is the disrespect, while the brother is focused on being turned away. The question is about who's in the wrong. If the brother's behavior was the root cause, then the author isn't wrong for standing her ground. \n\nAlso, the author was clear about the effort she put in, and the brother's lateness and rudeness disrupted that. So, the author's decision to cut things off might be justified. The brother needs to apologize for his harsh words first. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
