In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author initially agreed to cook for the brother after some back and forth. They had warned the brother not to be late, and he was running late. Then, when the brother called at 7:30, the argument happened. The author hung up and sent a text telling him not to come. The brother was already nearby but turned back home. The author is upset about the food going to waste and the brother insists the author is wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's behavior\u2014shouting and being disrespectful\u2014and the author's reaction. The author felt disrespected and chose to cut things off. But was that justified?\n\nThe brother did ask for lunch and the author made efforts, but the brother's late arrival and the rude outburst could be seen as a breach of trust. However, turning someone away in the rain might seem harsh, especially if the brother had apologized. But the author felt that the brother's disrespect was worse. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more gracefully, like inviting him in but setting boundaries. But given the context of being shouted at and the author's feelings about being disrespected, their reaction makes sense. The brother's non-apology is also a factor. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they were defending their own boundaries and feelings. The brother's actions were disrespectful, so the author's response, while harsh, was a reaction to that. However, the situation is a bit of a gray area. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is B (No) because the author stood up for themselves against disrespect. But some might argue that the brother's apology, however bad, means the author should have let him in. But the author felt that the brother's behavior was worse. I think the key is the mutual misunderstanding and both parties having valid points. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the brother's initial rudeness, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
