In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the sister cooked a meal for her brother and his girlfriend, but he was late and ended up angry with her. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the brother initially asked for lunch, and the sister agreed after some back and forth because she was busy and broke. Then she called him in the morning to confirm the time, he said 6 PM, which the sister noted is typical for him. She prepared a lot, even asking him via text not to be later than 6:30. He called at 5:30 saying he was running late, which she expected. She told him to not be too late. Then at 7:30, he called explaining he was on the bus. She interrupted, he got angry and shouted at her. She hung up and sent a text saying he should find something better if he's going to be that inconvenient. He turned up later, got cold, went home, gave a non-apology, and she won't apologize. Now he's saying she's wrong for turning him away in the rain.\n\nSo, the key points here. The sister made an effort to accommodate his request, even adjusting her schedule. She communicated her limitations, like the time. The brother didn't respect her time boundaries, was late, and then lashed out. The sister felt disrespected and cut things off. The brother now is upset she didn't let him in despite the cold and rain.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the sister had a right to set boundaries. She was clear about the time, he didn't respect that. When he became abusive, she had the right to stand her ground. Turning him away was a consequence of his disrespect. The brother's anger seems unwarranted, especially after he was the one who caused the situation by being late and rude.\n\nHowever, maybe the sister could have handled it differently. Instead of cutting off communication, maybe she could have let him come in but still addressed the disrespect. But given that he was shouting and being abusive, her reaction is understandable. She was trying to protect her own emotional well-being and the effort she put into the meal.\n\nThe brother's argument that turning him away in the cold is worse seems to downplay his own role in the conflict. He didn't follow through on the agreed-upon time, and his response was aggressive. The sister isn't to blame for enforcing the boundaries she set. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
