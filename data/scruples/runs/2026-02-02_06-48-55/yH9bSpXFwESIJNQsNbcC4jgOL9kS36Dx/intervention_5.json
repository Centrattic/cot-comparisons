In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to unpack this situation. The author, an older sister, invited her brother and his girlfriend for lunch, but she was already stressed with finances and busy. She made several accommodations, like adjusting the time and planning for possible delays. Her brother, however, showed up late, which was typical for him. The conflict escalated when he shouted at her during a call, leading her to hang up and refuse to let him in, even though it was raining heavily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister had put in a lot of effort, communicated clearly about the time, and made adjustments. The brother's lateness wasn't new, but his rude outburst was out of line. The sister's reaction was to cut him off, which might seem harsh, but she felt disrespected. The brother is now upset that she turned him away in the rain, but he also apologized insincerely.\n\nThe question is whether the sister was in the wrong. On one hand, she had a right to set boundaries and not tolerate disrespectful behavior. On the other hand, refusing to let him in during bad weather might be seen as cutting off someone in need, especially after planning a meal. But the brother's behavior triggered her response. She was already stressed and felt disrespected. The sister's actions were a defense of her own comfort and respect. The brother's insincere apology complicates things further. It might be that both have valid points, but the sister was reacting to a breach of respect. So, maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
