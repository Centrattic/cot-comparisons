In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after an argument. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend after initially being busy and broke. She went through the effort of cleaning, buying food, and preparing dinner. She told him not to be late, but he got stuck on the bus and arrived late. When she called him, he shouted at her, which upset her, so she hung up and told him not to come over. He was already near her house but had to leave because it was cold and raining. Now he's upset and wants an apology from her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother was late, which she expected, but he got angry when she interrupted him. She felt disrespected and hung up, then refused to let him come over. The brother argues that turning him away in the cold is worse than his outburst. The sister is holding her ground.\n\nNow, who's at fault? Let's consider both sides. The sister had every right to expect basic respect, especially after all the effort she put in. Getting shouted at is unkind, and she had a right to be upset. On the other hand, the brother might have been stressed about being late, but his outburst was uncalled for. However, by the time he arrived, he was already there and in the cold, but she refused him entry.\n\nIs she in the wrong? She stood her ground on the disrespectful behavior, which is valid. But turning him away might have been a harsh reaction. However, given the context of being disrespected, maybe she had the right to set that boundary. Also, he had the option to go home if he was cold, but he chose to come. But he ended up leaving anyway because it was too cold. So maybe she's not wrong for not letting him in after the argument. The brother's behavior was inexcusable, so her reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
