In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She mentioned she was broke and busy, but still tried to accommodate. The brother changed the time from 6 to 6:30, which she was okay with. Then he was late again, ended up being over an hour late, and got angry when she interrupted him to ask when he'd arrive. He shouted at her, which she found unacceptable. She hung up and sent a text saying he shouldn't make her cook for such an inconvenience. When he arrived, it was cold and rainy, and he left without eating, then gave a non-apology.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The sister put in a lot of effort to prepare the meal, adjusted her schedule, and communicated her needs. She asked him to be on time and not be late, but he was. His behavior escalated when she asked for an update, leading her to hang up. She stood her ground on respecting how she's treated.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother might feel hurt that he was turned away, especially in the rain. He did show up eventually, so maybe he thought he'd still get the meal. His initial lateness and the outburst might have been inconsiderate. However, she did prepare a meal, which he didn't eat, causing waste. But she's planning to donate it, which is good.\n\nThe key points are about mutual respect. The sister's boundaries about being spoken to rudely are valid. The brother's actions crossed a line with the shouting. The sister's reaction to that was justified. However, turning him away after he arrived might be seen as harsh, but given the prior behavior, maybe not. It's a conflict between his right to expect the meal and her right to not be disrespected. The sister prioritized her own emotional well-being, which is important. The brother might not see it that way, but his apology was a non-apology, so he's not taking responsibility.\n\nI think the sister isn't in the wrong because she set boundaries and the brother violated them. The brother's actions were disrespectful, so her reaction is understandable. The answer should be B (No).\n"
