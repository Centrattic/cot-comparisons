In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The sister cooked a meal for her brother and his girlfriend, but he was late and got angry. She hung up on him and turned them away in the rain. The key points are her initial willingness to help despite being busy and broke, her clear communication about the time, his disrespectful behavior when he was late, and her decision to not let them in after the argument.\n\nFirst, she made an effort to accommodate them, even adjusting her schedule. She texted to set a time and warned about being late. When he was late, she was understanding but firm. However, when he lashed out with \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK,\" that's a major issue. She felt disrespected and chose to end the interaction, which is reasonable given the tone. The brother's response was dismissive and didn't take responsibility, which complicates things.\n\nThe sister's actions were in self-defense against disrespect. She doesn't owe anyone her time or hospitality, especially after being disrespected. The brother's anger over being turned away seems more about his actions than her decision. The fact that she was cooking in the rain and had to throw out food adds to the emotional weight, but her stance is about mutual respect.\n\nConsidering all this, the sister isn't in the wrong. She set boundaries and stood by them after being treated poorly. The brother needs to reflect on his behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
