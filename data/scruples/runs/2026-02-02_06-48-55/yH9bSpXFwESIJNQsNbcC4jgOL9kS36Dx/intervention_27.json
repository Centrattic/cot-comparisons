In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother asked for lunch, and the author initially said no but then agreed. The author was already stressed and broke, which makes sense. They made clear that they were expecting him at 6:30, but he was late. The brother texted he was running late, and the author told him not to be too late. Then he ended up being even later, and when he called to explain, he shouted at her. The author felt disrespected and hung up, telling him not to come. He went to her house but left when it was cold and rainy, then gave a non-apology.\n\nThe author's actions: she was upset by his shouting, which is understandable. She had invested time and effort, and felt disrespected. Turning him away because he was rude and showed up late after being warned. But he was already near her house. The brother's perspective is that being turned away in the cold is worse than his outburst. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? She did have a right to be upset about the disrespect. However, after he showed up and left, she turned him away despite the weather. Maybe she could have let him come in even after the argument? But he was rude, and she didn't want to be around someone who spoke to her that way. Also, he didn't apologize properly. The author's main issue was the shouting and disrespect, which is valid. But maybe she could have handled it differently, like letting him come in but not being friendly. But she had already cooked all the food and was upset. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's behavior was definitely inconsiderate. He was late, shouted, didn't apologize sincerely. The author had invested a lot, and his attitude made her lose her temper. However, turning him away in the rain might have been harsh, but given the circumstances, maybe she had a point. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong. She had valid reasons for being upset. The brother's behavior was worse. So maybe answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But maybe others would see her as being too strict. Hmm. I think it's more that the brother is in the wrong for his behavior, but the author's actions are a reaction to that. So she's not in the wrong.\n"
