In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend after initially declining. She made an effort despite being busy and broke. She communicated with him in the morning to confirm the time, and even adjusted her schedule to accommodate his likely lateness. She texted him to not be later than 6:30, which he acknowledged. But then he was an hour late, and when she called him, he shouted at her, leading her to hang up and send an angry text. He ended up turning back because it was cold and rainy, going home instead.\n\nNow, the key points here are the communication and the conflict. The sister put in a lot of work, expected a certain time, and was clearly upset when her brother was late and disrespectful. The brother's reaction of shouting \"shut up you prick\" is definitely crossing a line, especially if that's not their usual dynamic. The sister's response\u2014hanging up and refusing to let him come over\u2014might be seen as a reaction to his disrespect, but she left him in the cold and rain, which could be harsh.\n\nThe brother claims that turning him away was worse than his harsh words. The sister feels that his disrespect warranted her reaction. The question is, who's at fault here?\n\nOn one hand, the sister did make an effort and communicated her expectations. The brother's outburst was unprovoked and disrespectful. On the other hand, the sister could have tried to defuse the situation instead of cutting him off, leading to him being in the rain. There might be a lack of empathy from both sides. The sister might have overreacted by turning him away, but the brother's behavior definitely contributed. \n\nHowever, the sister's main issue was the disrespectful communication, which is a valid reason to end the interaction. But leaving him in the cold without a word might be seen as harsh, even if justified. The outcome of the food going to waste is also a point the sister is upset about, but that's more about her feelings rather than the ethical aspect.\n\nConsidering all this, the brother's disrespectful behavior initiated the conflict, but the sister's reaction was a valid response to that disrespect. However, turning him away in the rain, while understandable in the heat of the moment, might be seen as going too far. But given the brother's actions, maybe the sister isn't entirely in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the brother's behavior was more at fault here. The sister had the right to set boundaries, but perhaps could have handled it more gracefully. Still, the main issue was the brother's outburst. So I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because she was reacting to his disrespect and had already put in the effort. However, there's nuance here. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
