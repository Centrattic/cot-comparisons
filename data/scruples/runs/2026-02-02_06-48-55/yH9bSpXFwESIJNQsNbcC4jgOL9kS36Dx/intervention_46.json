In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain after a heated argument.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend, despite being busy and broke. She made multiple efforts to adjust her schedule and communicated her expectations. The brother was late, which she had anticipated. When she confronted him over the phone, he yelled at her, which upset her. She hung up and sent a message that made it clear she didn't want to see him. He ended up not coming, and now he's upset about her turning him away in the cold, while she's upset about his rude behavior.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's disrespectful behavior versus the sister's reaction. The sister had a right to feel disrespected when he shouted at her. She made it clear she couldn't tolerate that. By hanging up and not letting him come over, she's standing her ground on her boundaries. However, the brother was in the pouring rain and ended up not eating the meal, which he might see as inconsiderate. \n\nBut the sister's actions were a direct response to his disrespect. She had already put in a lot of effort, and his outburst crossed a line. The sister's refusal to apologize might be seen as justified if the brother's behavior was unprovoked. However, the sister's message about finding something better to do might come off as harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's initial request was to have lunch, which he might have seen as a favor. The sister's reaction to his lateness and outburst might be seen as overreacting, especially if the brother didn't intend to be abusive. But the sister's right to set boundaries is important. \n\nThe sister's decision to give the food away shows her trying to make the best of a bad situation. The brother's insistence on an apology might be about feeling rejected, but his own actions contributed to the situation. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, the brother's shouting and disrespect is a clear issue. The sister's response, while firm, was a reaction to that. So, perhaps the brother is more in the wrong here. However, the sister could have handled it differently\u2014maybe not hanging up immediately, but still, her stance on boundaries is valid. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because her actions were a response to her brother's disrespect, and she had every right to set those boundaries.\n"
