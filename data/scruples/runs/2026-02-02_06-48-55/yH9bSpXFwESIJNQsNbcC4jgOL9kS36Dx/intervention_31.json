In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister turning her brother away when he showed up late for dinner, especially in bad weather. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author initially agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend, even though she was busy and broke around Christmas. That seems considerate. She tried to accommodate his request, adjusted her schedule, and even texted him to be on time. But her brother ended up being significantly late, and when she called him out on the phone, he yelled at her. The sister hung up and sent a text saying he should find another place to eat if it's so inconvenient. The brother then showed up, got cold, and went home again. He's upset she turned him away in the rain, while she feels he was disrespectful.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's behavior. He was late, then yelled at her, which the sister found unacceptable. She didn't want to engage with someone who talked to her like that. She stood by her decision not to apologize. The brother, on the other hand, is insisting she's wrong for turning him away in the cold. \n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective: she put in a lot of effort to prepare the meal, adjusted her schedule, and communicated her needs clearly. When the brother was late, she was understanding but had limits. His yelling crossed a line, and she felt justified in ending the interaction. She didn't want to spend time with someone who disrespected her, which is a valid feeling.\n\nOn the brother's side, he showed up late and in bad weather, but he might not have realized the impact of his actions. His yelling and subsequent non-apology could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. However, showing up late in the rain might have been a factor in his frustration, but that doesn't justify his behavior.\n\nThe sister's response to turn him away might seem harsh, but given the context of being yelled at, it's about respecting boundaries. She did communicate her expectations, and when those were violated, she took a stand. However, turning someone away in the cold could be seen as a harsh consequence, especially if the brother wasn't intending to be so rude. But again, she was already upset from the phone call.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the brother's disrespectful behavior was the catalyst. The sister's reaction was a response to that. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether her action (turning him away) was a reasonable response to his behavior. If she had let him in after he was rude, that might have escalated the conflict. By not letting him in, she's asserting her boundaries, which is important for healthy relationships.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once he arrived, despite the lateness and rudeness, she could have let him in and addressed the issue then. But given the prior argument, she might have felt it wasn't safe or respectful to continue the interaction. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the sister's actions were about protecting her own emotional well-being after being disrespected. The brother's behavior was inexcusable. Therefore, the sister isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself. Answer B (No) seems appropriate.\n"
