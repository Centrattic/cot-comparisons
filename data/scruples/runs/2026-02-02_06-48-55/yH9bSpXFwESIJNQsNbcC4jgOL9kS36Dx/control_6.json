In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the sister is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after he shouted at her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister agreed to cook for her brother and his girlfriend, but he kept being late. She warned him not to be too late because she was putting in a lot of effort. Then when he called at 7:30, he was still on the bus and shouted at her. She told him off, hung up, and sent a text saying he should find somewhere else to go. He left but came back, got cold, and went home. He's upset about her turning him away in the rain, but she feels he shouldn't have spoken to her that way.\n\nSo, the main issue here is how the brother treated her. He shouted, which was out of character for their relationship. The sister felt disrespected and stood her ground. The brother is now saying that being turned away in the rain is worse than his behavior. The sister is conflicted because she's upset about the food but also about how he treated her.\n\nI think the key points are the brother's disrespectful behavior and the sister's right to set boundaries. Even though the brother might be upset about the weather, his initial disrespect seems to be the main problem. The sister had the right to feel offended and decide not to let him in after that. However, some might argue that she could have handled it differently, like letting him come in after the argument. But given the context, she might have felt justified in not wanting to associate with someone who spoke to her like that. \n\nAlso, she mentions they're pretty casual, so maybe their dynamic allows for such conflicts. But the sister isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself. The brother's actions were the catalyst. So the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
