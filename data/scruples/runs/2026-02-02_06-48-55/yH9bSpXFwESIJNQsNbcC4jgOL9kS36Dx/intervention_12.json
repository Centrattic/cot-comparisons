In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She was already stressed because of financial and time constraints. She made arrangements, even adjusting her schedule. Then, the brother called late and got angry when she interrupted him. He used harsh language, which upset her, so she hung up and told him not to come. He ended up not showing, and she's upset about the wasted food.\n\nNow, the key points here are the brother's behavior versus the sister's reaction. The brother was late, which isn't uncommon, but his outburst was aggressive. The sister felt disrespected and hung up. Then she decided not to let him come over, considering his attitude. \n\nThe brother is now upset that she turned him away in the rain, while the sister thinks his rude behavior justified her actions. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The brother's shouting might have been out of frustration, but it's still disrespectful. However, the sister didn't give him a chance to apologize or make amends. She cut him off, leading to the situation where he was stuck in the rain. \n\nThe sister's point about being disrespected is valid, but cutting someone off without a second chance can also be seen as harsh. Maybe there's a middle ground, like allowing him to come but setting boundaries about the behavior. \n\nThe food waste adds to her frustration, but the core issue is the conflict between their actions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The brother's behavior was definitely inconsiderate, but the sister's reaction might have been overly punitive. However, since she felt disrespected, her response could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the brother deserved the outburst, then she's justified. But if she could have handled it differently without cutting him off entirely, maybe she's at fault. \n\nThe sister's actions were a reaction to disrespectful treatment, but turning someone away in the cold might be seen as harsh. However, she had the right to set boundaries. The brother's insistence that she should apologize might be part of the problem. \n\nIn summary, both parties have contributed to the conflict, but the sister's decision to turn him away was a response to being treated poorly. It's a tough call, but maybe the brother's behavior was more in the wrong, but the sister's reaction might be seen as justified given the context. However, if there's a way to forgive and move on, perhaps the sister could have done that. But based on the information, her actions were a response to disrespectful treatment. So maybe she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
