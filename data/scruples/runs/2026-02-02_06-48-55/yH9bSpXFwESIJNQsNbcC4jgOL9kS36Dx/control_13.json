In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend during a busy and broke time of year. She adjusted her schedule to accommodate them. Then, when the brother arrived late, they had a conflict over the phone. He used harsh language, she hung up, and told him not to come. It was raining and cold, and he ended up going home.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's disrespectful behavior. He shouted at her, which is a clear breach of acceptable communication. The sister felt disrespected and decided not to let him in, which led to him being in the cold. The brother now claims that turning him away is worse than his insult. \n\nThe question is about whether the sister is at fault. The sister had the right to set boundaries, especially when subjected to abuse. While turning someone away in bad weather might seem harsh, the brother's actions were inconsiderate and disrespectful. The sister prioritized her own comfort and safety after being treated poorly, which is understandable. \n\nI think the sister isn't in the wrong because she was defending herself against disrespectful treatment. It's important to respect each other's boundaries. The brother's behavior was the initial issue, so the sister's reaction, while perhaps impulsive, was a response to being disrespected. \n\nBut I should also consider if there's a cultural or familial norm that suggests siblings should be more forgiving. However, no one is obligated to tolerate abuse, even from family. The sister made a choice to prioritize her own well-being after being insulted. So, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong."
