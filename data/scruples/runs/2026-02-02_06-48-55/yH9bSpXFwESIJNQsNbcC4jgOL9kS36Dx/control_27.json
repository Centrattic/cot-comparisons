In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The sister agreed to cook for her brother after initially hesitating because of being busy and broke. She made preparations, even adjusting her schedule. The brother was late, which is something she expected, but then he became rude on the phone, shouting at her. She hung up and told him not to come over, which he did, leading to him getting soaked in the rain and then giving a non-apology.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's behavior. He was running late, which is frustrating, but his response was to shout and be disrespectful. The sister stood her ground, setting a boundary about how he treats her. She felt disrespected and chose to end the interaction, which led to the brother feeling upset and claiming he was wronged by being turned away.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective. She put in effort to cook, communicated about the timing, and when faced with disrespect, she defended herself. Her reaction to his insult seems reasonable. Turning him away was a consequence for his behavior, not just for being late. The brother's insistence that she should apologize suggests he's not taking responsibility for his part in the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother ended up in the rain and was cold, but that's a result of his own actions. The sister had no obligation to let him in after he disrespected her. She's prioritizing her own comfort and setting boundaries, which is important in any relationship. The fact that she's upset about the food going to waste shows she didn't want to cause harm, but he chose to act disrespectfully first.\n\nSo, the sister's actions were in self-defense of her personal boundaries. The brother's behavior was the catalyst here. Therefore, the sister isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
