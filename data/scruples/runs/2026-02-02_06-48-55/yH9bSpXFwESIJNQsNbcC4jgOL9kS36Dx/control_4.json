In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother after initially hesitating because she's busy and broke. She even adjusted her schedule and prepared a lot. She asked him to be on time, but he was late again. When she called to ask when he'd arrive, he shouted at her, which she found unacceptable. She hung up and sent a text saying he should find something else if he's going to be a bother. Then, when he came close to her house, she turned him away, and he went home. Now he's upset and says she should apologize for turning him away in the cold.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister made an effort to accommodate her brother, he was late again, he insulted her, she stood her ground, and now he's upset about being turned away. The sister feels justified because of his rude behavior. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the brother might feel that she overreacted to his lateness and the argument. He was in the rain and cold. But on the other hand, he was disrespectful, shouting at her over the phone. She had the right to set boundaries, especially after he disrespected her. She also tried to communicate her needs (not being late) beforehand. His response was unapologetic, which adds to the sister's frustration.\n\nI think the sister isn't in the wrong because she had the right to stand up for herself when he was rude. She even tried to be accommodating but he didn't meet her expectations. Turning him away after he was disrespectful makes sense from her perspective. The brother's reaction seems to be missing the point about the respect issue. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
