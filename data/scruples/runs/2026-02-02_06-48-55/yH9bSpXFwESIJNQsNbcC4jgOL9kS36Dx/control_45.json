In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's brother wanted lunch, and the author agreed after some back and forth. The author prepared a lot, but the brother was late. When they called, the brother shouted at the author, which upset her. She hung up and told him not to come. He ended up not showing up, and now he's upset she turned him away in the rain.\n\nFirst, the brother's behavior. He agreed to the time, was told the author was busy and making an effort, then got late. When contacted, he was rude, called her a prick, and hung up. That seems pretty harsh. The author had a right to be upset with that treatment. She didn't invite him in after that, which is why he ended up being turned away. But was that wrong?\n\nThe brother's argument is that the author should have accepted his apology (which he calls a non-apology) and let him in despite the weather. But the author felt disrespected. She had prepared a meal that she was now throwing away. She felt she had the right to set boundaries after being shouted at. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled the situation better. For example, instead of hanging up, maybe she could have calmly told him she wasn't okay with his tone and ended the call. But she did communicate her discomfort and then sent a text. The brother's response was to not apologize properly, which left the author feeling justified in her actions.\n\nConsidering the context: the author was stressed, had made an effort, and the brother was disrespectful. The brother's behavior seems to be the main issue here. The author isn't the one who was inconsiderate; the brother was late and rude. So, the author setting a boundary by not inviting him in might be reasonable. \n\nBut some might argue that turning someone away in the cold is harsh. However, the brother's actions (shouting, being disrespectful) might justify the author's decision. The author isn't responsible for the brother's behavior. She's in a position to decide how she wants to be treated. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
