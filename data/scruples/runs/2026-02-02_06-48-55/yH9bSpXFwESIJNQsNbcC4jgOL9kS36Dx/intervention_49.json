In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. The situation involves the sister cooking a meal for her brother and his girlfriend, but he ends up being late and they get into an argument over the phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She's already stressed about money and time, especially around Christmas. She agreed to cook after initially hesitating, which shows she made an effort. She communicated her need for them to be on time, and when they were late, she got a rude response from her brother. She felt disrespected and hung up, then sent a message that led to them turning back home. \n\nOn the brother's side, he was running late due to public transport delays, which might be out of his control. His reaction of shouting \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\" is definitely inappropriate. However, the sister's response of being dismissive and making them go back in the rain could be seen as harsh, especially since they were already nearby and the weather was bad.\n\nThe key points are: the brother's disrespectful behavior, the sister's legitimate effort in preparing the meal, and the outcome of him being turned away. The sister felt justified because of the disrespect, but others might argue that her punishment was too severe, considering the brother's possible genuine issues with timing and the weather.\n\nThe sister's decision not to apologize is based on her feelings of being disrespected. However, the brother's non-apology is also an issue. The meal going to waste might add to her frustration, but it's not directly the brother's fault if he can't eat it now.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while both might have acted inconsiderately, the sister's action of turning him away in the cold could be seen as harsh, especially if the brother's lateness wasn't entirely his fault. However, the brother's disrespectful tone was definitely wrong. The sister's response might have been more about protecting her own boundaries, which is valid, but maybe she could have handled it differently to avoid making them go out in bad weather.\n\nSo, considering both sides, I think the sister is in the right because the brother's behavior was unacceptable. But others might argue she should have been more accommodating despite the disrespect. However, given that he was already nearby and the sister was clearly upset, maybe she isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
