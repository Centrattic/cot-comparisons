In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after a heated argument. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the sister offered to cook for her brother and his girlfriend despite being busy and broke around Christmas. She adjusted her schedule to accommodate the request. Then, the brother called at 5:30 saying he was running late, which she expected. At 7:30, when he called again, he was still an hour away. She got angry when he shouted at her, hung up, and told him not to come over. He ended up in the rain, turned back, and gave a non-apology.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective: she put in a lot of effort, was patient with his lateness, but the insult crossed a line. She felt disrespected and chose to end the plan. The brother, on the other hand, might argue that he was close enough to make it, and she was overly harsh by not letting him in despite the bad weather.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respect is important. The brother's use of a derogatory term was disrespectful, and the sister has the right to set boundaries. However, she could have handled the situation more calmly, like asking him to come in for a few minutes instead of turning him away. But given his disrespectful behavior, her reaction might be justified. The key is whether the sister's response was proportionate. She didn't want to be around someone who disrespected her, which is valid. On the other hand, he was cold and wet, which adds sympathy. The sister's actions might be seen as a necessary boundary, so maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she could have offered some accommodation despite the argument, that might have been better. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she stood up for herself against disrespect, even though there's room for compromise.\n"
