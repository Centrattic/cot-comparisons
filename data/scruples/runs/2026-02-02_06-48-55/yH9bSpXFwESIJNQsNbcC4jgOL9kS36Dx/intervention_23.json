In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, an older sister, cooked a meal for her brother and his girlfriend. She was already stressed because of being broke and busy around Christmas. She set a time, but he was late. She warned him to be on time, but he ended up being late again. When she called him out, he shouted at her, which she found unacceptable. She hung up and told him not to come, leading to him getting stuck in the rain. Now she's upset about the wasted food and wants to know if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the brother's behavior was inappropriate. Shouting \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK\" isn't acceptable, especially if they don't usually interact like that. The sister had a right to feel disrespected. She had invested a lot of effort into the meal, which added to her stress. However, turning him away in the cold might be seen as harsh, even if he was rude. \n\nThe sister's reaction was defensive. She felt her effort was being disrespected, so she stood her ground. But does that justify cutting him off completely? Maybe she could have found a middle ground, like rescheduling or asking him to apologize before refusing. The brother's non-apology and insistence that she's wrong complicates things. \n\nOn the other hand, she had the right to set boundaries. Being shouted at is unpleasant, and she didn't have to endure that. The food going to waste is unfortunate, but maybe she could have offered it to someone else instead of taking it out on her brother. \n\nConsidering all factors, the sister's actions were a reaction to being disrespected, but perhaps there was a more compassionate way to handle it. However, her stance on not tolerating disrespect is valid. The brother's behavior was inexcusable. So, the author might not be entirely to blame. Answer B.\n"
