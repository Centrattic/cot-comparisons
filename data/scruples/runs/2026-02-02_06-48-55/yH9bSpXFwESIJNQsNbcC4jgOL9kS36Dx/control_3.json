In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the brother asked for lunch, and the author initially said no but then agreed after some back and forth. The author put in a lot of effort, even texting the brother to be on time. The brother was late, which isn't new, but when the author called to check, the brother shouted at them. That's a big issue. The author hung up and told them to find another meal. Then the brother showed up, got cold and wet, turned back, and gave a half-hearted apology.\n\nSo, the key points here: the brother's behavior was disrespectful. The author had clear boundaries about being spoken to that way. The brother's actions (being late, shouting, not apologizing properly) might have crossed a line. The author was in a stressful situation, financially and with their time, especially around Christmas. \n\nBut, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of turning them away, maybe there's a middle ground, like letting them in but not being overly accommodating. However, the brother's disrespect was a trigger. The author felt that they couldn't spend time with someone who treated them that way. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother was in the cold and wet, which could be seen as harsh. But the author had already made their position clear via text. The brother's actions led to his own situation. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they were respecting their own boundaries. The brother's disrespectful behavior justified the author's reaction. So answer B.\n"
