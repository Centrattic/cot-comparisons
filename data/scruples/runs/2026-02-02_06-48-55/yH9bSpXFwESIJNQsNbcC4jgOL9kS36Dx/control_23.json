In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning away their brother in the rain. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author initially said they couldn't cook lunch because they were busy and broke around Christmas. Then they changed their mind and agreed to cook. The brother changed the time twice, first to 6, then said he'd be late. At 7:30, the brother calls and gets shouted at, leading the author to hang up and tell him not to come. The brother ends up going home because it's raining and cold. The author is upset about the food going to waste.\n\nSo, the main points are about expectations and communication. The author set up the meal, but the brother's lateness and disrespect triggered a strong reaction. The key issue here is whether the author overreacted. The brother's behavior was unkind, but the author's response was to turn him away, which could be seen as harsh, especially considering the weather. However, the author felt disrespected and was within their right to set boundaries. The brother's lateness and outburst contributed to the situation. The author's decision to not let him in after the conflict might be justified as self-respect, but it's a delicate balance. The brother's argument is that being turned away in the cold is worse than his outburst, but the author's stance is about the respect during the interaction. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were defending their personal boundaries after being disrespected. However, maybe a more measured response could have been better. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and the brother also has some responsibility for his lateness and disrespect. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
