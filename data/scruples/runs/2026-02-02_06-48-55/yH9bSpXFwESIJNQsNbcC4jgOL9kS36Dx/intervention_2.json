In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain. The situation involves a sibling who asked for lunch, was late, then got angry on the phone, and she hung up and sent a harsh message.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions she's been busy and broke around Christmas, which adds stress. She made arrangements for lunch at 6, but her brother was late again. She warned him not to be late, and when he called at 7:30, he was disrespectful, shouting, and she felt disrespected. She hung up and told him to find something else. He then left but it was raining, and he was cold, so he turned back home. He's not apologizing, and she's upset about the food going to waste.\n\nThe author's actions seem to stem from frustration with her brother's repeated lateness and disrespectful behavior. She had put in a lot of effort, and the situation escalated when he shouted at her. Her response was to cut him off, which led to him being turned away in bad weather. \n\nOn the other hand, her brother did arrive late despite being warned, and he used harsh language, which is clearly not acceptable. However, the author's response might have been overly harsh, considering he was already on the way and the weather was bad. She was within her right to set boundaries, but turning him away in the rain after he had already started the journey could have been seen as cruel, depending on the context.\n\nBut the key point is the brother's disrespectful behavior. If he's someone who typically acts this way, the author isn't necessarily wrong for standing up for herself. She could have handled it differently, like offering him a coat or something, but her main issue was the tone he used. She was clear about not wanting to be spoken to that way. The brother's non-apology doesn't help, but the initial conflict started with his disrespect.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some fault. The brother for being late and disrespectful, the author for cutting him off without considering the weather. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the brother's actions were inexcusable, her response of not letting him in after he was already disrespected might be justified. The fact that she was making a point about respect could mitigate her fault. However, the outcome had her brother suffering in the cold, which is a negative consequence.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who is disrespected and sets boundaries is not in the wrong, even if their response could be seen as harsh. The brother's behavior was more egregious, so the author's reaction, while perhaps not ideal, is a reaction to being mistreated. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here. However, given the brother's initial disrespectful behavior, the author's actions are defensible as self-respect, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
