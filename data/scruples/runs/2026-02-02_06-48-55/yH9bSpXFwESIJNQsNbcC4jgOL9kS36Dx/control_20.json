In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the sister is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after he was late and yelled at her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister agreed to cook dinner for her brother and his girlfriend despite being busy and broke around Christmas. She adjusted her schedule to accommodate them. She communicated with him in the morning, set a time, and even reminded him not to be late. He was already running late, and when she asked when he'd arrive, he shouted at her. She hung up and sent a text saying he should find another place to eat. He then went to her house, got cold and wet, turned back, and gave a non-apology. Now she's upset and wants to know if she was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's behavior. He was consistently late, which the sister had warned him about. Then he yelled at her during the phone call. The sister felt disrespected and chose to end the conversation. She didn't let him in, which caused him to go home. The sister is defending her decision because of his disrespectful behavior, while the brother is upset about being turned away in the rain.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respect and boundaries are important. If someone is disrespectful, it's reasonable for the sister to set boundaries. However, some might argue that the brother was in the cold and wet, so she should have shown more compassion. But the brother's initial behavior (shouting and disrespect) complicates this. The sister had made efforts to accommodate him, but his actions crossed a line. \n\nThe sister's actions were a response to his disrespect. She had the right to decide not to let him in after the way he spoke to her. The brother's insistence that being turned away is worse than his bad behavior might not take into account the sister's feelings. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the brother's behavior was inexcusable. The sister had every right to prioritize her comfort and respect. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
