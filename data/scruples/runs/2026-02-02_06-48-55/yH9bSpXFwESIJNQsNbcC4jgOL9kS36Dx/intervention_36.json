In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after turning their brother away in the rain. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author initially agreed to cook for her brother after some back and forth. She made efforts to adjust her schedule and prepare the meal, even asking him not to be late. The brother ended up being late, and when she confronted him, he shouted at her. She hung up and texted him, leading to him leaving but then turning back due to the weather.\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault. But I need to consider both sides. The brother was late and used harsh language, which the author found unacceptable. She stood her ground on how she's treated, which is completely valid. However, she did turn him away in bad weather, which he found harsh. The brother's response and the fact that he went home might contribute to the conflict. \n\nThe key points: the brother's disrespectful behavior versus the author's right to set boundaries. The author felt disrespected and acted on that, but the brother's insistence on an apology suggests he didn't take responsibility. The weather adds an element of sympathy for the brother being cold, but the author's actions were a reaction to his behavior. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author had a right to be upset with the shouting, but the outcome of turning him away might be seen as harsh. However, the brother's actions were inconsiderate as well. I think both have some responsibility here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the brother's disrespectful behavior and the author's justified reaction, maybe she's not in the wrong. But some might argue she should have handled it differently. Hmm.\n"
