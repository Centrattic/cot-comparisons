In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about turning away their brother after a conflict. \n\nFirst, the author offered to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend despite being busy and broke. She made arrangements, even adjusting her schedule. But her brother was late, which she had anticipated. When he showed up late, she got into an argument where he shouted at her. She hung up and refused to let him in, leading to him getting cold and wet outside.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the brother's behavior and the author's response. The brother called her a \"prick\" and shouted, which the author found unacceptable. She felt disrespected and decided not to let him in after that. The brother is now upset because she turned him away, while the author thinks he shouldn't have talked to her like that.\n\nThe author's actions: She stood up for herself when she felt disrespected. She made a clear boundary about how she would be treated. On the other hand, her brother was late, but she had planned for that. However, his disrespectful behavior escalated the situation. The author's refusal to let him in after the shouting might seem harsh because he was already there, but considering the context, she might have been protecting her own feelings and the effort she put into the meal.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother might argue that being turned away in the cold is harsh. But he was the one who acted disrespectfully. The author didn't have to let him in after that. She could prioritize her comfort and respect. Also, the brother's non-apology complicates things.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: The brother was in the wrong for his disrespectful behavior. The author was within her rights to set boundaries. Turning him away after he disrespected her is a valid response. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
