In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning their brother away in the rain. Let me start by breaking down the situation. \n\nThe author initially agreed to cook lunch for their brother and his girlfriend, despite being busy and broke around Christmas. They even adjusted their schedule to accommodate. The brother asked about the time, agreed on 6 PM, and was told not to be later than 6:30. The brother was running late, which the author had anticipated. But when he called at 7:30, he was rude, called the author a \"prick,\" and the author hung up and sent a harsh message. Then the brother ended up not coming because it was cold and rainy, and he gave a non-apology.\n\nThe author refuses to apologize, thinking the brother's rudeness was worse than being turned away in the cold. The brother, however, insists the author is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author did put in effort to prepare the meal, communicated clearly about the time, and had warned the brother about being late. The brother's behavior was disrespectful\u2014he shouted, which the author found unacceptable. The author's reaction was to end the call and send a harsh message, which could be seen as cutting off the brother from the meal.\n\nBut the brother also had prior knowledge of the arrangement and the time. The author made it clear that being late was a problem. The brother's rudeness escalated the situation, leading to the author's anger. The author's actions led to the brother not being able to eat the prepared meal, which the author then plans to donate. \n\nNow, considering the etiquette involved. The brother's behavior was inexcusable\u2014shouting and being disrespectful. The author had a right to be upset. However, the author's response was to cut off the brother completely, even when the brother tried to explain. The brother was already nearby and in bad weather, which might have been a factor in his delay. The author's refusal to let him in, despite the weather, could be seen as harsh, but given the disrespect shown, maybe justified.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The brother's actions were inconsiderate and rude, but the author's reaction led to the brother being turned away in the rain. The author might argue that the brother's behavior was unforgivable, hence the decision. However, the brother was already cold and had to turn back, which is a consequence of the author's decision. The author's main point is that being shouted at was worse than the brother having to go home in the cold. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the brother's actions were definitely wrong, but the author's response might be seen as overly harsh. The author could have chosen to let the brother come in despite the rudeness, or at least not turn him away. However, given the context of the author's prior stress and effort, maybe the reaction is understandable. \n\nBut in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the brother was the one who was rude and disrespectful, so the author might not be in the wrong. The author's actions were a consequence of the brother's behavior. However, the author did have a choice in how to respond. Turning someone away in the cold could be seen as a harsh punishment, even if the other person was at fault. So maybe the author is partly at fault for not finding a middle ground. \n\nAlternatively, since the brother was already on the way and in bad weather, the author could have considered letting him in despite the rudeness, given that the food was already prepared. But the author felt that the disrespect was worse than the brother being cold. \n\nI think the key here is that the brother's behavior was inexcusable, but the author's response might have been too extreme. However, the author had the right to set boundaries. In the end, the brother chose to leave in the cold, possibly because he didn't want to face the author's anger. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, based on the way the question is phrased, the answer is either A or B. Given that the brother was disrespectful and the author felt justified in cutting off the relationship over it, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author could have handled it differently. \n\nBut considering that the brother was the one who was rude, the author's actions are a response to that. The author is not at fault for standing up for themselves. So the answer is B.\n"
