In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning her brother away in the rain after he yelled at her. \n\nFirst, the setup: the sister agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend during a busy, broke time around Christmas. She made accommodations, even adjusting her schedule to his typical lateness. She communicated clearly, even texting him to not be late. He ended up being an hour late, called her a \"prick,\" she hung up, and he left without a proper apology.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's behavior. He was already known for being late, but then he shouted at her during the phone call. The author states that their relationship isn't one where such language is part of normal banter. She stood up for herself, which is understandable. Then, when he showed up late and she turned him away in the cold rain, he gave a non-apology and insists she's wrong.\n\nNow, considering the sister's perspective: she put in a lot of effort, was clear about her limits, and her brother crossed a line by yelling. She had the right to set boundaries, especially when someone is disrespectful. Turning him away was her way of enforcing that boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother might argue that showing up in the rain was inconvenient, but his initial disrespect and lack of a real apology make it hard to sympathize. The sister's response was a result of being disrespected, not just a snap decision. The fact that she's upset about the food going to waste shows she's trying to make the best of it, which adds to her point.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the brother's actions (yelling, not apologizing) were inconsiderate and disrespectful. The sister's reaction was a boundary-setting response to that disrespect. While she could have handled it differently (like inviting him in but making it clear she's not okay with his behavior), the core issue is the brother's behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself and turning him away after he disrespected her.\n"
