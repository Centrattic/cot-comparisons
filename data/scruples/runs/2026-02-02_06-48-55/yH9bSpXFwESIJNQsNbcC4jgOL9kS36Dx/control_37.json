In the run up to Christmas I'm always really broke and really busy, so I initially told him I didn't think I could do it, then felt bad, juggled some shit and arranged it with him for today. \n\nWe're pretty casual about these things so I phoned him this morning to see if he still wanted lunch. He asked if 6 o'clock was a good time. This is pretty typical of my brother, and sometimes it's more endearing than exasperating, so I said that's fine. I spent the rest of the day cleaning, buying food and preparing dinner. I also asked him by text to please please not be later than 6:30, really spelling out how much effort I'd put into it. At 5:30 he said he was running late - again this is typical and I'd planned my dinner timings around the suspicion he'd be late. I said it was ok but to please not long it out. He lives about half an hour away by public transport and does the journey a lot. I was still feeling laid back. \n\nAt half past seven he called with a story about why he was still on the bus. I interrupted him to ask when he'd be here. He shouted \"SHUT UP YOU PRICK AND LET ME SPEAK\". We don't have the kind of relationship where that's just normal jovial bants. I don't talk to anyone like that and I don't expect anyone to talk to me like that. I don't know if it makes a difference but I'm his older sister. I told him not to speak to me like that and he doubled down. I hung up on him (petty yes, but being shouted at when I'm stirring your sodding cheese sauce is not the one) and told him on text if me cooking dinner for such an inconvenience for him he could find something better to do. I don't want to spend the evening with someone who's happy talking to me like that. \n\nSo the situation is this. When this was unfolding he was round the corner from my house. It's been freezing cold and pouring with rain all day (I should know, the supermarket I got the shit from is a 1.5 mile round walk). He was apparently already cold and went, and had to turn back and go home. He gave me a bullshit non-apology (\"sorry but you shouldn't have talked over me\"). I won't apologise for anything. He is insistent I should. He says turning him away in the cold and wet is worse than calling me a prick. I disagree, but the red mist is still gathered. I'd genuinely like some insight. A peaceful Christmas might depend on it. \n\n(PS. I've got a large roast chicken and several kilos of sweet potato mash and cauliflower cheese sitting untouched. I'm very upset about it. I'm going to portion it out and give it to a place near me that does outreach. Before I do that if anyone in South London is in need please DM me ASAP).\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by looking at the situation described. The author, an older sister, agreed to cook lunch for her brother and his girlfriend. She mentions being broke and busy around Christmas, which adds context to her stress. She adjusted her schedule to accommodate the lunch, even though she was initially unsure. The brother asked for 6 PM, which she agreed to, despite knowing he's often late. She emphasized not to be late, and he did end up late, then got angry and shouted at her.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's behavior. He shouted at her, which she found unacceptable, leading her to hang up and refuse to let him in, even though he was in bad weather. The brother now thinks she was wrong to turn him away, but she believes his disrespect was worse.\n\nSo, was she in the wrong? Well, she had the right to set boundaries, especially after being disrespected. The brother's outburst was unprovoked, and she had the right to protect her space and feelings. Even though he was in the rain, his behavior justified her reaction. She also considered the leftover food, which shows she's trying to do something positive with it. The brother's insistence on an apology might stem from not recognizing the severity of his actions. The author's actions were a response to disrespect, so she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
