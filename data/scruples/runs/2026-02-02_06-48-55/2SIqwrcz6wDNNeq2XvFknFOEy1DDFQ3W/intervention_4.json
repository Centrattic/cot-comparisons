Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending the hen party. The situation involves financial constraints, mental health, and existing living arrangements.\n\nFirst, the author is a housemate and best friend of the bride. They were asked to be a bridesmaid, so they had a commitment. The problem arises with the hen do's cost: \u00a3350 upfront, then \u00a360/month. The author can't afford this because they're on a debt management plan and have a car payment. They tried to explain this to the couple, but the groom was critical, and the bride was upset, accusing the author of being negative.\n\nThe author's main points are financial inability and the stress it causes. They also mention that the bride's friends make them feel bad, but they tried to be civil. The key here is whether not attending due to financial reasons makes the author a \"tight fisted ungrateful asshole.\"\n\nFinancial constraints are real. The author can't afford it and has other debts. They didn't say no initially but informed them late. The groom's reaction is harsh, expecting people to go into debt to attend. The bride's friends are part of the issue too, as they added unexpected costs. \n\nMental health is a factor too. The author's anxiety is through the roof. They don't want to live with people who pressure them into debt. The house arrangement is a possible factor, but the author is paying rent, so it's not purely a matter of favoritism. \n\nIn terms of social obligations, being a bridesmaid usually comes with expectations to attend major events, but it's not absolute if there are valid reasons. The author's situation is valid: financial hardship and mental health. The bride's friends being toxic adds to the burden. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The financial situation is genuine, and they're not choosing to be ungrateful but making a necessary decision. The bride and groom's reactions are part of the problem. The author's main issue is feeling forced into a financial burden they can't manage. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
