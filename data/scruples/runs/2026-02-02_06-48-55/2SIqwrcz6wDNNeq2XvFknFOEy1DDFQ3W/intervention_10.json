Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's hen party. The situation is a bit complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a bridesmaid for their best friend, Stephanie, and lives with her and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent, and it's mentioned that Stephanie and Dave earn three times what the author does. The author has mental health issues and doesn't get along with Stephanie's other friends, but they've managed to maintain a good relationship with Stephanie. \n\nThe hen party is a big trip to France, and the author is asked to pay \u00a3350 upfront, which they can't afford. They're on a debt management plan and already have a repayment plan for their car. They tried to explain their financial situation, but Dave and Stephanie reacted poorly, with Dave being judgmental and Stephanie being upset. The author is now considering not going because they can't afford it and don't want to take on more debt.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong?\n\nWell, the author made a commitment to be a bridesmaid and initially agreed to the hen party. They had a history of mental health struggles and have been careful with their finances. They've already made sacrifices, like not buying clothes or dining out. The cost was higher than expected, and they can't afford it. They tried to communicate their situation but faced judgment from Dave and Stephanie. \n\nFinancial responsibilities are a real issue, and it's not fair to expect someone to go into debt for a social event. The fact that the author is on a debt management plan and has a fixed repayment schedule shows they're responsible with money. The hen party cost was unexpected and beyond their means. Also, the author's mental health considerations shouldn't be overlooked. They've had past experiences where certain people caused them to feel bad, but they've managed to keep their friendship with Stephanie by avoiding situations that trigger their anxiety.\n\nOn the other hand, being a bridesmaid usually comes with certain responsibilities, including attending the hen party. The author did agree to it, but the cost was much higher than anticipated. However, they communicated their inability to pay, so it's not like they just backed out without trying. \n\nThe reactions from Dave and Stephanie might be part of the problem. They didn't offer alternative solutions or show understanding. The author isn't being ungrateful; they're trying to protect their financial stability. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their financial limitations and have a valid reason (mental health and debt) not to attend. The friends, especially Dave, are being judgmental without considering the author's situation. The author's priority is their mental health and financial responsibility, which are legitimate concerns. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
