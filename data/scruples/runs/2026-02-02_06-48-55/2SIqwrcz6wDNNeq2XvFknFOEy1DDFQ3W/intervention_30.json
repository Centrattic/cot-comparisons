Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party. The key points here are financial responsibility, mental health, and social obligations.\n\nFirst, the author is in a financially tight spot. They mentioned being on a debt management plan, having borrowed money for a car repair, and needing to pay back \u00a355 a month. The hen party costs \u00a3350 upfront, which they can't afford, and the payment plan offered by Stephanie's mother adds \u00a360 a month on top of their existing debts. Financially, this is a huge strain. The author is already cutting back on expenses, avoiding unnecessary purchases, which shows they're trying to manage their money responsibly.\n\nMentally, the author has a history of mental health issues and finds Stephanie's friends mean and shallow. They've improved their mental health by avoiding these people, and attending the hen party would mean being in an environment that could trigger negative feelings. This is a valid concern, especially when their mental well-being is at stake.\n\nSocial obligations come into play here. The author agreed to be a bridesmaid, which is a big commitment, and initially thought they could afford the trip. However, the actual costs were much higher than anticipated. The friends organized the trip without consulting everyone, leading to an unexpected financial burden. The groom (Dave) and Stephanie's reactions\u2014calling it \"disgusting\" and \"negative\"\u2014seem harsh, especially considering the author's financial reality.\n\nThe author is living with the couple, which might add to their feeling of obligation. They don't want to be seen as ungrateful, but they're also in a position where taking on more debt is risky. The key here is whether attending the hen party is a necessary expense given their financial situation and mental health needs.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't being selfish; they're making a responsible choice based on their circumstances. The friends and groom expected the author to go into debt to attend, which isn't reasonable. The author has the right to prioritize their financial stability and mental health over a social event they can't afford. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
