Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a bridesmaid for their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They live together, pay rent, and have a good relationship. The hen party is a big holiday in the south of France, which costs \u00a3350 upfront for flights and accommodation, with a payment plan of \u00a360 a month if they can't pay all at once. The author is on a debt management plan and already has a monthly payment to their uncle because their car broke. They can't spare the \u00a360, so they told Stephanie and Dave they can't afford it. Dave and Stephanie reacted negatively, saying the author is being negative and ungrateful. The author is now conflicted about whether not going is the right decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspects. The author has a debt management plan and a car payment. Their income is much lower than Stephanie and Dave. The hen party is a luxury trip, which might be more expensive than the author expected. The author was upfront about their situation when they told Stephanie and Dave. They were already paying for the car and managing debt, so adding another \u00a360 a month would be a significant burden. \n\nNext, the dynamics between the friends. The author doesn't like Stephanie's other friends, which makes them uncomfortable. However, they were willing to attend the hen party to support their best friend. The hen party is organized by Stephanie's sister and other friends, not directly by Stephanie or Dave. The author might feel that the hen party is being forced on them with a payment plan they can't manage. \n\nStephanie and Dave's reactions: Dave is upset because he thinks a friend should be there even if it means going into debt. Stephanie is defensive, saying the author is ruining something her mother dreamed of. But the author is a tenant in their house, so maybe they feel pressure. However, the author's mental health and financial stability are important. They mentioned that spending time with Stephanie's other friends makes them feel bad, which could add to the stress of attending the event.\n\nIs the author ungrateful for not going? They have a valid reason related to their financial situation and mental health. They were honest about their inability to pay, so they aren't hiding their situation. The friends might be expecting more commitment, but the author is already making sacrifices by living in the house and managing their own debts. The hen party cost is beyond what the author can handle. \n\nAlso, the payment plan proposed by Stephanie's mother might be an attempt to help, but the author can't afford the monthly payments. The fact that the author is trying to find a way to pay but can't suggests they're not being flippant. They might be in the right to prioritize their financial health. \n\nOn the other side, being a bridesmaid does come with certain expectations, like attending the hen party. But the author's circumstances are extenuating. It's not that they don't want to support the friend, but they can't financially. The friends' reaction might be more about their own expectations than the author's actual fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason based on their financial situation and mental health. The friends might need to understand that not everyone can afford the same expenses, especially when the author's income is significantly lower. The answer should be B.\n"
