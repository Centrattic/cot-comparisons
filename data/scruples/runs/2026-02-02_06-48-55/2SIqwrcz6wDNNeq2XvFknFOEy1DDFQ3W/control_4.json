Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's hen party because they can't afford it. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author lives with their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent for a room in the house Stephanie and Dave own. The author's income is much lower than Stephanie and Dave's. The hen party is a big event organized by Stephanie's sister and friends, costing \u00a3350 upfront with a payment plan if needed. The author is on a debt management plan, has a broken car they're paying off, and can't afford the \u00a3350 or the monthly payments of \u00a360. They tried to explain their financial situation to Stephanie and Dave, but Dave was dismissive, saying he'd go into debt to be there, and Stephanie was upset, saying the author was ruining her dream and being negative. The author is anxious about the situation, doesn't want to hurt their finances or be seen as ungrateful, but also doesn't want to go into debt.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author's financial constraints are real. They have existing debts and can't afford the additional expense. The hen party is a significant cost that wasn't anticipated (author expected around \u00a3200). The friends organizing it offered a payment plan, but the author can't manage even the monthly payments. The author's mental health is also a factor; they don't like Stephanie's friends and their presence affects their mental well-being. They've had past mental health issues that required them to distance from certain people.\n\nThe friends and Dave's reactions seem dismissive. Dave's comment about selling a limb to attend is out of touch with the author's financial reality. Stephanie's response is hurtful and doesn't acknowledge the author's valid concerns. The author is trying to be honest about their situation, which is a responsible thing to do.\n\nIn terms of friendship, being a bridesmaid is a role that comes with certain expectations, but financial responsibility is also important. The author isn't refusing out of spite but due to genuine inability to pay. They also considered the payment plan but can't manage it. They are in a vulnerable position financially and mentally. The friends' insistence on the author attending despite the financial strain seems unfair, especially since they are wealthier and the author is living with them.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're being honest about their limitations and prioritizing their financial stability and mental health. The friends, particularly Dave and Stephanie, aren't showing empathy towards the author's situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
