Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main question is whether not attending the hen party because of financial constraints is wrong. The author is a bridesmaid and was asked to be part of the hen party, which is a significant event. They agreed to be a bridesmaid but now feel they can't afford the \u00a3350 fee, even with the payment plan offered by the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's situation. They have a debt management plan, a broken car, and have to pay back their uncle. Their income is much lower than their housemates, so the financial strain is real. They mentioned that the hen party was more expensive than expected, and they can't afford it even with the payment plan. Their mental health is also a factor, as they feel anxious about going into more debt.\n\nOn the other hand, Stephanie and Dave might feel hurt because the author is not going. They might see it as the author not supporting them during this important time. Dave's reaction was strong, saying it's disgusting not to go, and Stephanie was upset about the mother's offer. The author was excited about being a bridesmaid and initially thought the cost would be around \u00a3200, which they could have managed, but the actual cost is higher.\n\nI should also consider social norms. Being a bridesmaid usually comes with certain responsibilities, including attending the hen party. However, financial limitations can be a valid reason not to attend. The key question is whether the author's decision is selfish or understandable given their circumstances. The author is prioritizing their financial stability and mental health, which are valid concerns. They are not refusing out of malice but because they can't afford it. \n\nThe author did communicate their financial situation to Stephanie and Dave, which shows they tried to be honest. They felt embarrassed but were upfront. The housemates' reactions might be seen as not fully considering the author's financial constraints. The author is in a vulnerable position because they live with the couple and can't easily move, which adds to the pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is based on genuine financial hardship and mental health considerations. While it's disappointing for the couple, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their well-being and financial stability. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
