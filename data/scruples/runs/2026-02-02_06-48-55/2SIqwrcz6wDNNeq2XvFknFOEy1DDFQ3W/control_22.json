Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's hen party due to financial constraints. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author lives with their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent for a room in the house Stephanie and Dave own. The author is on a debt management plan, has a broken car that's adding to their financial burden, and can't afford the \u00a3350 for the hen party. The hen party is a luxury trip to the south of France, organized by Stephanie's sister and others. The author was initially enthusiastic but is now struggling to afford it, even considering a payment plan from Stephanie's mom which is adding stress.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and mental health. The author has a history of mental health issues and has learned to avoid people who make them feel bad, which includes Stephanie's friends. They were already cutting costs in other areas (no clothes, dinners, etc.) to manage their debts. Now, the hen party cost is more than they can handle. They tried to communicate their situation, but Stephanie and Dave reacted negatively, implying the author is being selfish or ungrateful.\n\nI need to consider whether the author's decision to not attend is inconsiderate or if they're justified in their choice. The hen party is an expensive event, and the author isn't the one organizing it. They were a bridesmaid, which usually involves some costs, but the amount here is significant. The author's financial situation is dire, and they're already making sacrifices. Their mental health is also a factor, as they feel uncomfortable around Stephanie's friends and have had bad experiences in the past.\n\nStephanie and Dave's reactions seem harsh. Dave's comment about selling a limb and Stephanie's dismissal of the author's concerns might indicate a lack of understanding. The author isn't refusing to pay their share entirely; they're just unable to do so given their circumstances. The fact that they were upfront about their inability to pay and even tried to find a solution shows they care about the friendship but can't compromise their financial stability.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, while it's common for bridesmaids to attend the hen party, it's not a legal obligation. The author's mental health and financial well-being are valid reasons to decline. They're not avoiding the wedding itself but a specific event that's causing them undue stress. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable by not attending, but given their situation, it seems they're making a responsible choice.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're being honest about their limitations and prioritizing their health and financial stability, which is reasonable. The other side's reactions are more inconsiderate for not fully supporting their friend's decision.\n"
