Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party due to financial constraints. So, first, I need to analyze the situation based on the provided details.\n\nThe author lives with their best friend and her fianc\u00e9, paying rent for a room. They were asked to be a bridesmaid, which they happily accepted. However, the hen party is more expensive than expected (\u00a3350 upfront and \u00a360 monthly payments). The author is already on a debt management plan and has taken on an additional loan to fix their car. They can't afford the hen party without going deeper into debt. They communicated their inability to pay to Stephanie and Dave, but they responded unkindly, making the author feel guilty. Now, the author is considering not attending and wants to know if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, financial responsibility is a key point. The author is managing their debts carefully and can't afford the hen party's costs. Forcing them to take on more debt could harm their mental health and recovery. Friends should support each other's well-being, not push them into financial strain.\n\nNext, the hen party organizers (Stephanie's sister and friends) set up a surprise, which might not have considered the author's financial situation. The offer from Stephanie's mother to pay with a repayment plan adds pressure, but the author can't commit to that. It's not the author's fault if the planning didn't account for their budget.\n\nCommunication was attempted. The author explained their situation, but Stephanie and Dave reacted poorly. Their responses were dismissive and guilt-tripped the author. The author's anxiety is justified given their past mental health issues and current stress.\n\nThe value of the friendship is also important. True friends should respect each other's limits. The hen party is important, but the author's financial health shouldn't be sacrificed. The author isn't ungrateful; they're trying to balance their responsibilities.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a reasonable attempt to participate but can't afford the unexpected expense. The friends and fianc\u00e9 should have been more understanding and flexible. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
