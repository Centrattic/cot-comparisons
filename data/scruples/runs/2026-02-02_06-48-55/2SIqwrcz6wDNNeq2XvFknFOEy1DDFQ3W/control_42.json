Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party due to financial reasons.\n\nFirst, the author is living with their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent, and all three get along as a close-knit group. The hen party is planned as a luxury trip to the south of France, costing \u00a3350 upfront and \u00a360 monthly payments. The author can't afford that because they're already on a debt management plan and have a car payment. They tried to explain this to Stephanie and Dave, but Dave was dismissive, while Stephanie accused them of being negative and ruining her dream.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and boundaries. The author has valid financial constraints. They\u2019re already managing debts and can't afford to take on more. It's important to consider that mental health and anxiety are also factors here. The author has a history of mental health issues and found Stephanie's friends toxic. The hen party involves people who made the author feel bad, which adds to the stress.\n\nSocial obligations shouldn't override someone's financial stability, especially when it's not a family emergency or a one-time event. The hen party is a celebration, and while it's important to Stephanie, the author's well-being and financial health are equally important. The fact that Stephanie and Dave reacted negatively when the author explained their situation shows that they might not be considering the author's personal circumstances.\n\nAlso, the cost of the hen party was significantly higher than the author expected (\u00a3200 vs. \u00a3350+). They were already planning to attend if possible, but the unexpected expense is a key factor. The author is in a vulnerable position financially and can't afford to go into more debt. They\u2019re trying to manage their money responsibly, which is a commendable effort.\n\nOn the other hand, Stephanie is upset because she included the author in the surprise and felt that the author is ruining the experience. However, the author's refusal is based on genuine financial limitations, not a lack of wanting to support her. The author is still offering to find a way to contribute, but the reality is that they can't without harming their financial stability.\n\nI think the author is in the right here. They\u2019re making a responsible decision for their financial health and mental well-being. The friends and fianc\u00e9 should understand and respect that. The hen party is a significant expense for a social event, not an essential financial obligation. The author isn't being ungrateful; they\u2019re prioritizing their own needs, which is perfectly acceptable.\n"
