Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not attending their best friend Stephanie's hen party. So, first, I need to break down the key points.\n\nThe author lives with Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent for a room in the house Stephanie and Dave own. The author mentions that Stephanie's friends are mean and shallow, and they've had mental health issues in the past, which have improved by avoiding negative social circles. They agreed to be a bridesmaid and were okay to attend the hen party, assuming it would cost around \u00a3200, but the actual cost is \u00a3350, which they can't afford. The author is on a debt management plan and has to pay back an uncle \u00a355 a month for three years. They don't want to go into more debt. When they tried to explain this to Stephanie and Dave, both responded negatively, with Dave saying it's disgusting not to go into debt for a friend and Stephanie being dismissive.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not being able to afford the hen party and thus not attending. Let's consider the factors. The author has financial constraints and mental health considerations. They've been upfront about their situation and communicated their inability to pay. The hen party is a significant expense they didn't anticipate. On the other hand, they were asked to be a bridesmaid, which is a role that often involves attending events like the hen party. The friends organizing the event might expect the bridesmaid to be present.\n\nBut wait, the author mentioned they were already aware of the expense. The initial assumption was around \u00a3200, which they thought they could manage. The actual cost is way higher. That's a problem. Maybe there was a misunderstanding about the cost. However, the author might not have known about the full cost upfront. Also, the payment plan offered by Stephanie's mother is a way for the author to cover the cost, but the author can't afford the monthly payments. The author is in a difficult position because they can't live elsewhere affordably and are already in debt from their car breakdown.\n\nThe responses from Stephanie and Dave are concerning. Dave's comment about going into debt to \"sell a limb\" and Stephanie's dismissive attitude about the author's financial struggles and mental health could be seen as not empathetic. The author's primary concern is their financial stability and mental well-being. They don't want to take on more debt and are trying to recover from existing debts. The hen party is a social event, but the author's well-being and financial health are also important.\n\nIn terms of friendship, being a bridesmaid usually comes with expectations, but it's also important to respect personal limits. The author has a valid reason for not being able to attend, given their financial situation. The friends organizing the event might not have considered the author's financial limits. The author did communicate their issues and tried to find a solution, but the responses from Stephanie and Dave were not supportive.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They made an effort to attend and communicate their constraints. The friends and groom's reactions seem harsh and not considerate of the author's circumstances. The author's priority is their financial and mental health, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
