Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is whether they should go to the hen party even though it's a financial burden. \n\nFirst, the user is a bridesmaid for their best friend, Stephanie, and also lives with her and her fianc\u00e9, Dave. They've been friends for ten years, which is a long time. The hen party is a trip to the south of France, which costs \u00a3350 upfront, and the author can't afford that. They're on a debt management plan and have to pay back an uncle \u00a355 a month for three years. The author is already living paycheck to paycheck and can't spare the money. \n\nThe friend's sister and the other girls organized the hen do without telling Stephanie, and they asked the author for \u00a3350. The author tried to explain their financial situation, but Dave accused them of being disgusting for not going into debt, and Stephanie said they're being negative and ruining her dream. The author feels conflicted because they don't want to hurt their finances or be seen as ungrateful.\n\nNow, considering the author's mental health history and their dislike for Stephanie's friends, which they've had to manage for years, it's clear that attending with that group could be detrimental to their well-being. Also, financial stress is a real thing here. The author is already in a debt management plan and taking on more debt would set them back. They're not asking for anything; the payment plan is being offered by Stephanie's mom, but the author can't afford the monthly payments either. \n\nThe hen party was supposed to be a surprise, but the cost was way higher than expected. The author thought \u00a3200 was the max, but it's actually \u00a3350. Maybe the group didn't communicate the real cost properly. The author being honest about their inability to pay is responsible, especially since they're already stretched thin. \n\nDave's reaction is a bit harsh, saying they should borrow money or sell a limb, which is unrealistic. Stephanie's response is dismissive and doesn't take the author's financial situation into account. The author is trying to be considerate but can't afford it, so they're not being ungrateful, just realistic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're managing their finances responsibly and prioritizing their mental health. The issue is more on the other side for not considering the author's circumstances and the lack of proper communication about the hen party costs. The answer should be B (No).\n"
