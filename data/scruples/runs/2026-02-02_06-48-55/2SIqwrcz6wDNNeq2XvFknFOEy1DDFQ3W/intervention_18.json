Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not attending a hen party due to financial reasons. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a tenant in a house owned by their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent, which is a third of what the others earn. The hen do is a luxury trip in France, costing \u00a3350 for flights and accommodation, with a payment plan offered by Stephanie's mom. The author can't afford it because they're on a debt management plan and have other financial obligations.\n\nThe author's main points are about their financial struggles and mental health. They don't like Stephanie's other friends, which adds to their stress. They tried to be supportive but now feel pressured. The friends and Dave reacted negatively, suggesting the author is being ungrateful.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Hen parties are significant events, and bridesmaids are typically expected to attend. The author agreed to be a bridesmaid, which usually includes participating in the events. However, the cost here is much higher than expected. The author might feel it's unreasonable to take on more debt when they're already in a financial tight spot. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of being a guest. The payment plan from Stephanie's mom is offered, which might be a way to manage the cost. The author is choosing not to go despite this offer. Is it right to decline a friend's important event because of money, especially when alternatives are provided? \n\nMental health is a factor here. The author has a history of mental health issues exacerbated by certain social circles. Attending with people they don't get along with could be genuinely harmful. That's a valid reason to decline. \n\nBut the hen do is part of the wedding, which the author has already committed to by being a bridesmaid. The expectation is that they'll participate. The author is now backing out, which might be seen as a breach of that commitment. However, the financial aspect is a new variable. They didn't anticipate the cost and are now in a situation where they can't afford it. \n\nThe key points are: the author's financial inability to pay, the mental health impact, and the offer of a payment plan. They are in a vulnerable position financially. The friends and Dave's reactions seem harsh, pressuring the author into debt. The author is trying to be responsible with their money, which is understandable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and circumstances. If the author's refusal is based on genuine financial hardship and mental health, they might not be in the wrong. However, the expectation of attending a hen do as a bridesmaid is strong. The fact that the author was offered a payment plan complicates it, as it's a way to manage the cost. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they have a legitimate reason and have communicated it, maybe not. But if they could have found a way to afford it despite their situation, perhaps they are. However, the debt management plan and existing obligations suggest it's not just about not wanting to spend, but actual inability. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author has valid reasons related to mental health and financial responsibility. The friends and Dave's expectations might be unrealistic given the author's circumstances.\n"
