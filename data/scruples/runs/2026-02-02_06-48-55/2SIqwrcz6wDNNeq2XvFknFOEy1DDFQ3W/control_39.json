Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a best friend and housemate of Stephanie, who's getting married. The author was asked to be a bridesmaid and agreed. The hen party is a big trip to the south of France, and the author can't afford their share of the cost, which is \u00a3350 upfront plus \u00a360 a month. They're on a debt management plan already and can't spare the money. When they told Stephanie and Dave, Dave reacted harshly, and Stephanie was dismissive. The author is now considering not going and is worried about being seen as ungrateful or a tightwad.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The author has financial constraints. They're already in a debt management plan and have taken on a new loan for their car. They can't afford the hen party's costs. They tried to communicate this to Stephanie and Dave, but the response from Dave was judgmental, and Stephanie was unhelpful. The author is considering not attending to avoid debt but feels conflicted because they live with Stephanie and Dave, and don't want to be seen as ungrateful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not going. Let's think about the obligations here. The author was asked to be a bridesmaid, which is a role that often involves attending events like the hen party. However, financial capability is a real factor. People can't be expected to take on debt they can't manage, especially with existing financial responsibilities. The hen party's cost was higher than expected, and the author didn't anticipate needing to pay that much. \n\nStephanie and Dave, who are in a better financial position, might have expected the author to participate, but the author's circumstances are valid. The author isn't being cheap; they're trying to manage their finances responsibly. The fact that the hen party was organized in secret without consulting the author about the costs could also be a point, but the author did agree to participate, thinking it would be cheaper. \n\nThe key issue here is the author's financial situation versus the expectations of the bride and groom. The author isn't refusing to pay a reasonable amount but is unable to afford the higher-than-expected costs. The pressure from Dave and Stephanie to go into debt is part of the problem. The author is trying to avoid making their financial situation worse. \n\nIn terms of social obligations, sometimes people do make sacrifices, but it's not fair to force someone into debt. The author isn't being ungrateful; they're being realistic about their means. The fact that they tried to find a way to afford it (even considering cutting expenses) shows they wanted to attend but can't without risking their financial stability. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid financial reasons for not attending, and the expectations of the bride and groom don't take into account the author's actual ability to pay. The answer should be B (No).\n"
