Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending the hen party. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author lives with her best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. She pays rent for a room. Stephanie asked her to be a bridesmaid, which she agreed to. The hen party is a trip to the south of France, costing \u00a3350 upfront and \u00a360 a month. The author can't afford it because she's on a debt management plan, has a broken car, and already has financial obligations. She tried to tell Stephanie and Dave, but they reacted negatively, with Dave saying it's disgusting not to go and Stephanie being upset. The author is struggling between her finances and not wanting to hurt her friends.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility versus friendship obligations. The author is in a difficult financial situation, with existing debts and a low income. The hen party is expensive, and the payment plan offered by Stephanie's mom would add to her debt. The friends, especially Dave, seem to think she should prioritize attending the party over her financial stability.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, being a bridesmaid is a significant role, and the hen party is a big part of the wedding. Friends might expect you to be there. But on the other hand, the author has legitimate financial constraints. Her mental health is also a factor, as she's been through a lot with her mental health improving by distancing from toxic friends. She doesn't want to go into debt again.\n\nThe hen party organizers didn't check the affordability beforehand, which might be their oversight. The author communicated her inability to pay, but the response from Stephanie and Dave was dismissive. They might not have considered her financial situation, especially since they earn significantly more than her. The fact that she's living with them and paying rent shows she's already contributing, so expecting her to take on more debt might be unreasonable.\n\nThe author isn't being ungrateful; she's trying to manage her finances responsibly. The friends, however, are pressuring her into a situation that's not feasible. The payment plan from Stephanie's mom is a way to cover her, but the author is aware it's adding to her debt. She's trying to find a way to attend without causing financial harm, but it's impossible given her current situation.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and whether the person is being unreasonable. The author explained her situation clearly, tried to find solutions, and is being honest. The friends, on the other hand, are not considering her financial limits and are making her feel guilty. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's prioritizing her financial stability and mental health, which is reasonable. The answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
