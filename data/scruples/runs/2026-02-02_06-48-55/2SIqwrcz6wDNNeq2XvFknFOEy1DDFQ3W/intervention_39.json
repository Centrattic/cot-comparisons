Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party due to financial issues. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is a roommate and best friend of Stephanie, who is getting married. They were asked to be a bridesmaid. The hen party is a luxury trip costing \u00a3350 upfront and \u00a360 a month, which the author can't afford. They're already on a debt management plan and have a car repair payment. The author tried to talk to Stephanie and Dave (the groom), but they reacted negatively, saying the author is being negative and ungrateful.\n\nSo, the author is conflicted between their financial stability and not wanting to hurt their friend's feelings. They feel pressured to go into debt for the event, but their mental health and financial situation are at risk. The key points here are the financial strain, the mental health impact, and the pressure from friends who are in a better financial position.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the author is a bridesmaid and friend, which might imply some level of commitment to attend. On the other hand, the author's financial situation is dire, and they're already struggling with debt. They\u2019re also in a living arrangement where they pay rent, so it's not as if they're being housed for free.\n\nThe hen party is organized by Stephanie's sister and friends, not directly by Stephanie or Dave, but the author feels obligated to pay despite the cost. The author tried to explain their situation, but the friends and the groom were dismissive. This could mean that the pressure isn't entirely the author's fault but stems from the other party organizers.\n\nFinancial responsibility is important. The author isn't asking for a free trip; they're trying to manage their existing debts and avoid further financial trouble. The mental health aspect is also crucial here, as the author has a history of issues related to certain social groups, which adds to the stress of attending.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't being ungrateful by declining due to financial inability. The friends and the groom might be in the wrong for pressuring someone who is already in a worse financial position. The author is making a responsible decision to protect their own well-being, which is valid. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
