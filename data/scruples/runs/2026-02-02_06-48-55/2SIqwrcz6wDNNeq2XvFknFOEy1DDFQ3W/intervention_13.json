Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party due to financial constraints. \n\nFirst, the author is a bridesmaid and living with the bride and groom. They've been friends for 10 years, which is a significant relationship. The hen party is a big event, a luxury trip to France costing \u00a3350 for flights and accommodation, plus other activities. The author is struggling financially, on a debt management plan, and has taken on a car loan. They don't have the money and can't afford the \u00a360 monthly payment.\n\nThe bride and groom's reaction seems harsh. The groom calls it \"disgusting\" not to go, and the bride says the author is being negative and ruining her dream. The author feels pressured to take on more debt, which is causing anxiety. They live with the couple, which adds to the tension, as they might feel more obligated due to the living arrangement.\n\nFinancial responsibility is key here. The author is managing their debts and making sacrifices (no clothes, dining out, etc.). Expecting someone to go into debt to attend a party, especially when it's not a core part of the wedding (the actual wedding is the main event), might be unreasonable. The hen party is organized by the bride's sister and friends, not the bride herself, which could mean the author isn't directly responsible to the bride for attending.\n\nThe author's mental health is also a factor. They mentioned that the bride's friends make them feel bad, so even if they could afford it, being around people who trigger their mental health issues might be a valid reason not to attend. However, the author didn't mention this to the bride, which could be a point of criticism. But given that they've already distanced themselves from those friends in the past, maybe they have a right to avoid them again.\n\nThe bride's mother offering to pay might be a way to get the author to commit without considering their financial situation. The author's main issue is not the cost but the financial strain. The author is trying to be responsible, which is commendable.\n\nIn terms of friendship, while the author is a key part of the wedding, the hen party is a separate event. The bride and groom's reaction could be seen as dismissive of the author's financial reality. The author isn't the only one in the wrong here; the bride and groom, along with the organizers, might have overestimated the cost or not considered the author's situation. \n\nSo, the author is prioritizing their financial stability and mental health, which is understandable. They are not being ungrateful; they're making a difficult choice given their circumstances. The pressure from the bride and groom to attend despite the financial burden is more on them. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
