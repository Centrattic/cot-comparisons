Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're not going to their best friend's hen party because they can't afford the \u00a3350 required, even with a payment plan. The friend and her fianc\u00e9 are upset, and the author is struggling with whether they're being ungrateful or doing the right thing financially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The author mentions they're on a debt management plan and have a car payment, which means their finances are tight. They don't have money for non-essentials like clothes or hair/nails. The hen party cost is way more than they expected, and the payment plan would add to their financial burden. It's clear they can't afford this without going into more debt. Financial responsibility is usually seen as a positive trait, so maybe they're justified in saying no.\n\nThen there's the social side. The author was excited to be a bridesmaid and wanted to be part of the wedding. They initially agreed to go, but the costs were a surprise. The friends who organized it kept it secret, which might have contributed to the shock. The author's mental health is also a factor\u2014they don't get along with Stephanie's friends, which adds stress. Prioritizing mental health is important, so even if they could afford it, the anxiety from being around those people might be valid.\n\nStephanie and Dave's reactions seem harsh. Telling the author it's \"disgusting\" not to attend and calling them \"negative\" could be part of the problem. The author is in a vulnerable position, living with Stephanie and Dave, which might make them feel pressured to say yes. The fact that Stephanie's mother is offering to pay but expects repayment could add to the pressure, making the author feel they can't refuse without being seen as ungrateful.\n\nAlso, the hen party is a big event in France, which is expensive. The author expected around \u00a3200 but it's over \u00a3350. The organizers might not have communicated the full costs upfront, leading to the author's surprise. If the cost was clearer from the start, maybe the author would have said no earlier, but they were misled.\n\nIn terms of friendship, being a bridesmaid is a significant role, but it's not a legal obligation. The author has the right to prioritize their financial and mental health. While it's unfortunate they can't attend, it's not their fault for being in a difficult financial situation. The real issue might be the friends' lack of understanding and the pressure to conform to their expectations regardless of circumstances.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible financial decision, have valid mental health reasons, and the others involved didn't handle the situation with empathy. The answer should be B (No).\n"
