Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's hen party. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author lives with their best friend (Stephanie) and her fianc\u00e9 (Dave). They pay rent for a room in the house that Stephanie and Dave own. The author's financial situation isn't great\u2014they have a debt management plan and had to take a loan from an uncle for their broken car. Now, they're being asked to pay \u00a3350 for the hen party, which is a luxury trip to France. The author can't afford that and even if they take the payment plan, it's an extra \u00a360 a month, which they can't handle. They tried to explain this to Stephanie and Dave, but Dave was dismissive, saying friends should go into debt to attend, and Stephanie was upset, saying the author is ruining her dream.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they don't want to hurt their finances or be seen as ungrateful. They were expecting maybe \u00a3200, which they could manage, but this is way over their budget.\n\nSo, the main points here are financial capability, the expectations of friendship, and the mental health aspect. The author has mental health issues and doesn't get along with Stephanie's other friends, which adds stress. They also have significant debt and a lower income compared to Stephanie and Dave.\n\nI need to consider if the hen party cost is reasonable. The trip is luxury, which might be out of the author's price range. Also, the payment plan offered by Stephanie's mother is \u00a360 a month, but the author can't afford that. The author has already made sacrifices, like not buying clothes or going out to eat. They're being asked to take on more debt, which is causing anxiety.\n\nFrom the friends' perspective, they might feel hurt that the author can't attend, especially since they live together and the author is a bridesmaid. But the author's financial situation is a real constraint. The friends might not realize the severity of the author's debt and financial struggles.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, friends should consider each other's financial situations. The hen party being a luxury trip might be a personal choice of the bride and her friends, not necessarily the responsibility of others. The author has already expressed their inability to pay, which is a valid reason not to attend. The friends' reactions (Dave calling it \"disgusting\" and Stephanie being upset) might be overreacting, given the author's financial transparency.\n\nThe author isn't being ungrateful; they're being honest about their limits. It's possible they could attend if they could afford it, but they can't. The key here is whether it's reasonable to expect someone to go into debt for a party. Most people would agree that expecting someone to take on debt for a social event, especially when their income is much lower, is unreasonable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is based on their financial reality and mental health, and they've communicated this. The friends should be understanding rather than placing the blame on the author.\n"
