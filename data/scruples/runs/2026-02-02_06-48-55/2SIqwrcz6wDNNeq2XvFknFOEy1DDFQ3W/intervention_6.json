Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not being able to afford the hen party and deciding not to go.\n\nFirst, I need to recap the key points. The author is a best friend who's been asked to be a bridesmaid. The hen party is a luxury trip costing \u00a3350 upfront, which she can't afford. She's in a debt management plan and can't spare the money. She tried to tell her friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave, but they reacted poorly. Dave accused her of being disgusting for not going, and Stephanie said she was being negative and ruining the hen party. The author is struggling with mental health and doesn't like Stephanie's other friends, which adds to her stress.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for declining to go. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nLet me break down the arguments. On one side, the author agreed to be a bridesmaid and initially said she could handle the hen party. But when the actual cost came up, she realized it's too much for her financially. She's in a difficult financial situation, with existing debts and a low income compared to her housemates. She's also dealing with mental health issues and doesn't like the other friends, which might make the hen party uncomfortable for her.\n\nOn the other side, the bride and groom expect the bridesmaid to attend the hen party, which is a significant part of the wedding planning. The author's housemates (Stephanie and Dave) might feel that since they're providing her housing, she should make sacrifices to attend. However, the author is contributing rent, which is a separate matter. The hen party's cost is an additional expense, and she's already helping by living with them and paying rent.\n\nThe bride's mother offered a payment plan, but the author can't afford even the monthly installments. She's being honest about her financial constraints. The friends' reaction seems harsh, especially Dave's comment about selling a limb, which is unrealistic given her financial situation. Stephanie's dismissal of the author's concerns and the emotional pressure are also problematic.\n\nMoral considerations: Is it reasonable to expect someone to go into debt or take on a significant financial burden for a friend's event? Financial responsibility is important, and the author is managing her debts responsibly. The hen party is a luxury that isn't a necessity, so expecting someone to sacrifice their financial stability for it might be unfair.\n\nSocial expectations: Bridesmaids are typically expected to attend the hen party, but if the cost is unreasonable, it's acceptable to decline. The author made it clear she couldn't afford it after agreeing initially, which shows she tried to be honest. The bride's reaction is more about disappointment than the author being in the wrong.\n\nMental health aspect: The author mentions that Stephanie's friends make her uncomfortable and affect her mental health. Attending the hen party could exacerbate her issues, making it a valid reason to decline despite the social pressure.\n\nFinancial disparity: The author earns much less than Stephanie and Dave, so expecting her to pay for a luxury trip might be unfair. The payment plan from the mother is an offer, but the author can't comply due to her existing debts. She's not being ungrateful; she's prioritizing her financial well-being.\n\nPutting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her inability to afford the hen party, tried to find a solution, and is managing her financial responsibilities. The negative reactions from Stephanie and Dave are more indicative of their expectations than the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
