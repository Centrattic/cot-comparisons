Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author lives with their best friend (Stephanie) and her fianc\u00e9 (Dave), who own the house and cover the rent. The author has a lower income, three times less than the others. They were asked to be a bridesmaid, which they accepted enthusiastically. The problem arises when the hen party, organized by Stephanie's sister and friends, costs \u00a3350 for flights and accommodation, with a payment plan of \u00a360/month. The author is already on a debt management plan and borrowed money for a broken car, making the additional financial burden impossible. They approached Stephanie and Dave, but Dave criticized their decision not to go into debt, while Stephanie was upset, saying the author was ruining her dream. The author is now anxious, considering not going despite the payment plan offered by Stephanie's mother.\n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. Key points to consider: \n\n1. **Financial Constraints**: The author has significant financial obligations, including a debt management plan and a car loan. The hen party cost is beyond their means. The payment plan from Stephanie's mother was meant to be kind, but the author can't afford the monthly payments.\n\n2. **Mental Health and Friendships**: The author has a history of mental health issues linked to being around Stephanie's other friends, so attending might cause distress. The author's mental health is a valid concern here.\n\n3. **Friendship Dynamics**: The author is a good friend, having supported Stephanie through their engagement and agreed to be a bridesmaid. However, the hen party is a separate financial commitment. The author is in a vulnerable position financially and can't commit to the additional cost without worsening their situation.\n\n4. **Expectations vs. Reality**: The author expected the cost to be around \u00a3200, which they could manage, but the actual cost is much higher. The friends organized the trip in secret, which might have been a surprise but without considering the financial realities of all attendees.\n\n5. **Responsibility and Priorities**: The question is whether not attending is selfish. The author is prioritizing their financial stability and mental health over attending a hen party, which is a significant but not life-threatening event. However, the hen party is part of the wedding plans, which Stephanie has dreamed about. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being a bridesmaid usually involves participating in the events, but financial hardship might be a valid reason. The friends might have expected the author to find a way, but the author's current financial situation is dire. The author isn't being ungrateful; they're making a difficult choice based on their circumstances. The friends' response, especially Dave's, seems dismissive of the author's actual financial struggles, which might indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nThe author's decision not to attend isn't about being cheap or ungrateful but about maintaining their financial health. They've already sacrificed by being a bridesmaid and living with the couple. The hen party's high cost without prior discussion could be seen as a misstep by the organizers. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not attending due to financial constraints and mental health considerations. They are not selfish but making a necessary choice for their well-being.\n"
