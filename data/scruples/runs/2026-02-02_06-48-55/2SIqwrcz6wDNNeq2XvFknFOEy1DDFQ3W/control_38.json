Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a friend's hen party that they can't afford to attend. They live with the friend and her fianc\u00e9, paying rent for a room in their house. The hen party is a luxury trip to France costing \u00a3350 upfront and then \u00a360 monthly payments. The author is already on a debt management plan and has taken on a new debt from an uncle. They can't afford this extra expense.\n\nFirst, the author agreed to be a bridesmaid and said they could be civil with the other girls. But when the cost came up, they realized it's beyond their budget. They explained their financial situation to Stephanie and Dave, but they reacted poorly. Dave called it disgusting, and Stephanie said the author is being negative and ruining her dream.\n\nNow, the key points: The author has financial constraints. They're not being greedy; they're in a debt management plan and can't take on more debt. They're already sacrificing other things like clothes and dinners. The hen party cost was higher than expected (\u00a3200 vs \u00a3350). The author is trying to be honest about their ability to pay, which is a valid concern. Stephanie's friends are mean, which adds to the author's stress.\n\nThe other side is that being a bridesmaid often involves attending the hen party. But the author has a valid reason not to attend due to financial issues. They're not refusing out of spite but because they can't afford it. Also, the payment plan from Stephanie's mom might be a way to ease the cost, but the author can't afford the monthly payments either. \n\nIn terms of expectations, friends should consider each other's circumstances. The author isn't the one causing the high cost; it's the organizers. The fianc\u00e9 and friend's reaction seems dismissive of the author's financial struggles. The author is trying to find a solution but the others are not being understanding.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision about their finances and communicated their situation. The problem lies with the high cost and the friends' lack of empathy.\n"
