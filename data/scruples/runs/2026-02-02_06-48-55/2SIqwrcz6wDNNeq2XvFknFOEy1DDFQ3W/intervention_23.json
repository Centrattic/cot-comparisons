Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a hen party (which is a bachelorette party in the US, I think). The author is a best friend and housemate who can't afford the costs involved, which are quite high\u2014\u00a3350 upfront and then \u00a360 a month. The author has financial difficulties, including being on a debt management plan and a car repair that's adding to their financial burden. They also mentioned mental health issues with the other friends, which they've been avoiding for years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations around being a bridesmaid. Typically, bridesmaids are expected to participate in events like the bachelorette party. But the cost here is a significant issue. The author is in a tight financial situation, and the cost is beyond what they can handle. The bride, Stephanie, and her fianc\u00e9 Dave seem to be pressuring the author to go into debt to attend, which is problematic because it's not fair to expect someone to take on debt for a party, especially when they're already struggling.\n\nThe author has valid reasons for not being able to afford this. They mentioned that they don't have the money, they're already paying back their uncle, and they can't afford to spend on other things. The fact that the hen party is organized in a way that even the bride's mother is offering to pay, which adds to the author's discomfort, shows that the financial expectation is high and perhaps unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did agree to be a bridesmaid and initially said they could handle being around the other girls. But the financial aspect was a surprise, and the cost is way higher than expected. The author's mental health issues with Stephanie's friends might also make the event more stressful than just the cost. They have a history of mental health issues related to those friends, so even if they could afford it, attending might be emotionally taxing.\n\nDave's reaction seems harsh, saying it's disgusting not to go into debt for a friend. That's a lot of pressure. Stephanie's response is also dismissive, calling the author negative and ruining her dreams. That's not supportive, especially given the author's financial situation.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, the expectation to attend events, and the existing financial and mental health struggles of the author. The author isn't ungrateful; they're trying to manage their own life and health. They're living with the couple and helping with rent, which shows they're contributing. The hen party costs are an additional burden that's not feasible for them. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not being able to attend, and the financial expectation is unreasonable. The pressure from the bride and her fianc\u00e9 is misplaced. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
