Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not attending their best friend's hen party. The key points here are about financial responsibility, mental health, and friendship.\n\nFirst, the author agreed to be a bridesmaid and was excited about it. They were aware that they'd have to be civil with Stephanie's other friends, which they've managed in the past. The hen party is a significant expense\u2014\u00a3350 upfront and \u00a360 monthly payments. The author is in a debt management plan and has taken on an additional \u00a355 monthly payment for a car repair. They can't afford the extra \u00a360. \n\nThe friends and Stephanie's sister organized the trip secretly, and the author felt pressured to come up with the money quickly. Stephanie's mother offered to cover the cost, expecting repayment. The author approached Stephanie and Dave, explaining their financial situation, but they responded harshly, making the author feel ungrateful. \n\nThe author is struggling with anxiety and feels trapped because they live with Stephanie and Dave. They don't want to be in more debt but also don't want to be seen as ungrateful. The question is whether the author is wrong to prioritize their finances and mental health over attending the hen party.\n\nI need to consider the expectations in friendships, especially when it comes to financial commitments. Bridesmaids often have expenses, but the amount here is quite high. The author has a valid reason\u2014mental health issues when around Stephanie's friends and financial constraints. They communicated their problem and tried to find a solution. The friends' responses were unsupportive, which might shift the blame towards them. \n\nThe author isn't refusing due to dislike but because of real financial and mental health limitations. Saying no isn't about being ungrateful but about self-preservation. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe there's an expectation as a bridesmaid to be present despite the cost, but given the specific circumstances, the author has a valid excuse. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made their position clear, have valid reasons, and the friends' reactions were harsh. Prioritizing one's mental health and financial stability is reasonable.\n"
