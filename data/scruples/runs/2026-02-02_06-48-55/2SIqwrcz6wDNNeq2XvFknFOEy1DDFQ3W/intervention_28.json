Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's and housemate's hen party. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author lives with their best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. They pay rent for a room in the house that Stephanie and Dave own. The author is a bridesmaid and was asked to join the hen party, which is a luxury trip to the south of France next June, costing \u00a3350 upfront and then \u00a360 a month from the bride's mother. The author doesn't have the money now and can't afford the monthly payments because they're already on a debt management plan and have to pay back \u00a355 a month for three years after their car broke. They also don't spend on clothes, dinners, or hair/nails, so their budget is tight. When they told Stephanie and Dave they couldn't afford it, Dave said he would go into debt to be there, and Stephanie was upset, saying they were being negative. The author is now worried about being in more debt and not wanting to be an ungrateful friend.\n\nFirst, the key points here are financial responsibility and the existing debt management plan. The author is in a difficult financial situation, with their debt plan already stretched by a car repair loan. The hen party's cost is more than they can handle, even with a payment plan. The friends organizing the hen do offered a payment plan, but the author can't meet the monthly payments. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The hen party is a big event, and the author was asked to be a bridesmaid. Stephanie is their best friend. However, the author has a history of mental health issues and doesn't get along with Stephanie's other friends. They were upfront when they agreed to be a bridesmaid, saying they could be civil for a few days. But the financial aspect is now a problem. The author's current financial commitments are essential, like the debt management plan and the car loan. The hen do's cost is a discretionary expense, not a necessity. \n\nThe friends' reaction seems a bit harsh. Dave's comment about going into debt to be there might be more about his own expectations than the author's situation. Stephanie's mother offered to pay upfront, which the author might have been uncomfortable with, but the author can't manage the monthly payments. The author is trying to be responsible with their money, which is a sign of good financial management. \n\nIs the author expected to go into more debt for a hen party? Since the author is already on a DMP and has a car loan, adding another financial burden could be detrimental to their well-being. The hen party is a once-in-a-lifetime event, but the author's financial and mental health are also important. The author might be considered ungrateful if they don't go, but their circumstances are valid. \n\nThe author's main reasoning is that their current financial situation doesn't allow for it, and they don't want to be in more debt. They also mentioned that the cost was much higher than expected (\u00a3200 vs. \u00a3350). The friends may have assumed the author could afford it, but that's not the case. \n\nIn terms of the payment plan, if the author can't afford \u00a360 a month, even with the mother's help, then it's not a feasible option. The author is honest about their limitations, which is a good trait. The friends might not be considering the author's financial reality, especially since they earn significantly more but that doesn't mean the author should be expected to spend beyond their means. \n\nSo, the author isn't being ungrateful; they're being responsible. The friends might not be understanding of the author's situation. The author's mental health is a factor, but the main issue is financial. The author is in a position where they can't take on more debt, and that's a legitimate reason to decline. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they are making a responsible financial decision and can't afford the event without harming their well-being.\n"
