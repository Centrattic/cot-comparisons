Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to their best friend's hen party due to financial constraints.\n\nFirst, the author is a bridesmaid and was excited to be part of the wedding. They agreed to go to the hen do, thinking the cost would be around \u00a3200, which they thought they could manage. But the actual cost is \u00a3350, which is way over their budget, especially since they're on a debt management plan and have other financial obligations like the car and the uncle's loan. They can't afford the \u00a3350 upfront and the \u00a360 monthly payment would strain their finances further.\n\nThe friends (Stephanie and Dave) and the other organizers expect the author to go, even offering a payment plan from Stephanie's mom. Dave is critical of the author for not wanting to go into debt, while Stephanie is upset and says the author is ruining her dream. The author feels pressured and anxious, living with the same friends, and is worried about being seen as ungrateful.\n\nNow, considering the author's financial situation: they have a debt management plan, a broken car requiring payments, and minimal discretionary spending. The hen do cost is beyond what they can realistically handle. They also mentioned that Stephanie's friends make them feel bad, which added to their mental health struggles. They tried to be civil but now can't afford to go. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize their own financial health? They have legitimate reasons\u2014mental health, existing debts, and inability to afford the trip. They communicated their situation to Stephanie and Dave, but they were unsympathetic. The friends might not have considered the author's financial limitations when planning the expensive event. \n\nThe key points here are financial constraints, mental health, and communication. The author isn't being ungrateful; they're making a responsible decision given their circumstances. The friends expected the author to go into debt, which isn't fair. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a tough choice to protect their well-being and finances.\n"
