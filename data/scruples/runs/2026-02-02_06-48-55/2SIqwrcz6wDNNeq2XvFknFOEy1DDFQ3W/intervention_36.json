Both enjoy having me there and in general the arrangement works out well.\n\nThey both earn more than 3 x what I do, if this matters.\n\nThey got engaged in July and I was asked to be a bridesmaid. I was very excited, and as this is my best friend of ten ish years I couldn\u2019t imagine not being a part of their wedding. The groom and I are also good friends due to being housemates, we are almost like a little family.\n\nI do not like Stephanie\u2019s friends. They are mean and shallow and materialistic and when I hang out with them I feel bad. I have a history of mental health issues if this matters - a big part of my road to recovery was understanding when I hung out with certain people, I would feel bad afterwards. My mental health has greatly improved since I stopped hanging out with this group of girls three or so years ago. I kept the friendships that didn\u2019t make me feel bad - such as Stephanie.\n\nI enthusiastically agreed the hen do would be great and not to worry about me not liking the other girls going - I could be civil for a few days to celebrate my best friends wedding.\n\nStephanie\u2019s sister and some of the girls going organised the hen do in secret, wanting Stephanie to be surprised. Three days ago I received a text from this group asking for \u00a3350 by Saturday (tomorrow) - and that if I couldn\u2019t afford it Stephanie\u2019s mother would pay my share and I could pay her back \u00a360 a month. The hen do will be a holiday to The south of france for four days, staying in a luxury villa/mansion, with a wine tour, a night out and a dinner. The \u00a3350 only covers flights and accommodation and will be in June next year.\n\nI do not have \u00a3350, I do not have \u00a360 a month spare. I am on a debt management plan and my car broke two months ago, meaning I had to borrow money from an uncle and agree to pay him back \u00a355 a month for three years. This was already a financial stress to me as I try to pay off my debt. I have been paying it off for three years and would have been debt free in a years time, but will be paying my uncle back for some years now. I don\u2019t buy clothes, I don\u2019t go out for dinners, I don\u2019t get my hair and nails done. I am sensible with my money.\n\nI approached Stephanie and Dave (he just happened to be there) - I said I was embarrassed about being offered to pay her mother back as they obviously know I can\u2019t afford the hen do, and that I just didn\u2019t know how I was going to afford to go.\n\nDave said it was disgusting of any friend, especially a bridesmaid, not to go to a hen party. He said he would go into debt or borrow money or \u201csell a limb\u201d to be there for a friend. Stephanie said I was \u201cbeing negative\u201d that I would \u201cupset her mum who offered to pay to be nice\u201d and that I\u2019m \u201cruining something she has dreamed of since she was a little girl\u201d\n\n\nI laid awake that night for hours trying to think of what I could sacrifice so that I will have an extra \u00a360 a month for this hen do. I feel awkward and uncomfortable living with people who want me to go into debt for their benefit, but can\u2019t find anywhere else to live that I can afford, though I\u2019ll keep looking. My anxiety is through the roof at the concept I\u2019ll be in more debt if I go.\n\nAITA if I say I just can\u2019t afford it and I\u2019m not going? Even though they let me live in their home and have offered me a payment plan? I don\u2019t want to hurt my finances but I don\u2019t want to be an ungrateful cow of a friend. I was expecting the whole thing to cost around \u00a3200, which I probably could have squeezed. reddit, be brutal. Am I a tight fisted ungrateful asshole here?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not going to her best friend's hen party. So first, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe author lives with her best friend Stephanie and her fianc\u00e9 Dave. She pays rent, and they own the house together. The hen party is a planned trip to southern France, which costs \u00a3350 upfront and \u00a360 a month. The author can't afford either, given her debt management plan and recent car troubles. She's on a tight budget, doesn't buy clothes, etc. She tried to tell Stephanie and Dave, but they reacted poorly, with Dave saying it's disgusting not to go and Stephanie being upset about her mom's offer to cover the cost. The author is conflicted between her financial situation and not wanting to be seen as ungrateful.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. She's a bridesmaid, which is a big role in the wedding. The hen party is a significant part of the wedding preparations, and she was asked to be part of it. She agreed initially but later realized the cost would be too much. But she's in a difficult financial situation, already in debt, and can't afford this additional expense. \n\nOn one hand, friends often expect you to support them during big events. Not going might be seen as letting them down, especially after agreeing to be a bridesmaid. The hen party is a special event, and the author's absence could hurt Stephanie's feelings. The fact that Dave and Stephanie reacted strongly suggests that they value her presence. The author might feel she's being selfish, not wanting to help despite the financial strain. Also, they offered a payment plan, which she's rejecting, which could be seen as ungrateful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has legitimate financial issues. She's in a debt management plan, has a car payment, and can't afford any extra expenses. She's prioritizing her financial stability over the hen party, which is understandable. Her mental health is also a factor, as she's anxious about going into more debt. She's not trying to be ungrateful but is in a real bind. The hen party was organized secretly, and the cost was higher than expected. The friends Stephanie is with are known to be mean, which adds to her discomfort.\n\nThe key points here are the financial responsibility versus the social obligation. The author isn't refusing because she doesn't care but because she can't afford it. However, she did agree to be a bridesmaid, which comes with certain expectations. The hen party is part of the wedding, so her absence might be seen as a betrayal, especially if she knew the cost upfront. But she didn't know the full cost until recently, and she's already in a tough financial spot. The fact that Stephanie and Dave live with her and she pays rent might imply some level of financial support, but that's separate from the hen party.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to weigh both sides. The author has a valid reason not to go, but she also did agree to be a bridesmaid, which includes participating in the hen party. The friends' reaction is harsh, but that doesn't excuse the author from her role. However, given her financial constraints and the fact that the cost was higher than expected, it's a tough situation. The hen party is a once-in-a-lifetime event, but the author can't afford to go into more debt. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the hen party is considered an essential part of being a bridesmaid. If the author agreed to be a bridesmaid, she's expected to attend the hen party. But if the cost is unreasonable and she can't afford it, maybe she's not at fault. The key is that she tried to communicate her financial situation and is being honest. The friends' reactions are part of the issue here. The author isn't being ungrateful; she's prioritizing her financial health. So maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
