Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this story did something wrong by dropping the woman's clothes and leaving the store. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nThe person is 18 and in a clothing store. They were holding someone else's stuff while she went to get more clothes. Then, after coming back, the same woman asked if she could talk to the cashier before the person could check out. The person agreed. Then they went to look at dresses, and the cashier asked the person to bring a dress over. The person did that, but then the woman asked them to hold another dress. The person got angry, dropped all the clothes, and left. The woman and cashier muttered about them being disrespectful.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the actions. The person was kind enough to hold the woman's clothes initially. Then, when the woman asked to check out first, they allowed it. The cashier then asked them to move the dress, which they did. But when the woman asked them to hold another dress, the person got frustrated and left. \n\nI think the key points here are the repeated interruptions and the expectation to hold multiple items for others while waiting. The person was already waiting in line, had their time taken up by the woman's requests, and then had to hold more items. The cashier's request to bring over the dress might have been part of the problem, but the final straw was the woman asking to hold another dress. The person might have felt disrespected or taken advantage of, leading to their outburst.\n\nHowever, the appropriate response to frustration is important. Dropping the clothes and leaving might be seen as disrespectful, even if they were upset. But considering the situation, maybe it's understandable. The person was a teenager, possibly not wanting to be treated as an unpaid helper. It's a balance between respecting their time and the other person's actions.\n\nI think the person might have overreacted, but the situation was pretty frustrating. The woman was using them as a helper without any compensation or acknowledgment. The cashier also added to the issue by involving them. So while the action of dropping the clothes was rude, the underlying cause might not be entirely the author's fault. But technically, they did act inconsiderately once they were there. So maybe they are in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. Hmm.\n"
