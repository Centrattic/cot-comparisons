Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is 18 and was in a clothing store. They held a woman's stuff while she left for five minutes. Then, when they were about to check out, the woman asked them to wait again to let her ask the cashier a question. After that, she had them hold another dress while she and the cashier compared options.\n\nThe user got frustrated and dropped the clothes, leaving. The others called them disrespectful. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the initial help: the woman asked to hold her stuff briefly. The user agreed, which is polite. Then, the woman again asked them to hold more stuff while she looked at dresses. The user waited once, but getting asked again might be excessive, especially since they were about to checkout. \n\nHowever, the user's reaction was to drop the clothes and leave. While understandable frustration, the action itself was abrupt and possibly rude. Maybe they could have handled it better, like politely declining to hold more items or expressing their discomfort. \n\nBut considering the context, the user was already waiting a long time. The woman's second request could have been too much, especially with the cashier involved. The user's right to be upset is valid, but the method of handling it might be at issue. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They had every right to feel frustrated, but the act of dropping the clothes without a word might come off as disrespectful. However, the woman's actions were inconsiderate. The store employee might also be at fault for expecting the customer to hold items. \n\nThe key here is whether the user's actions were a reasonable response. Arguably, they could have communicated their frustration instead of acting out. But the woman's repeated use of the customer as a personal errand runner is also problematic. \n\nI think the user isn't entirely in the wrong. They were being asked to do something unreasonable, but their reaction could have been more composed. The answer might be B, No, because the main issue is the woman's inconsiderate behavior, not the user's initial willingness to help. The user's outburst is a symptom of being pushed beyond their limit, which is human, but the method of handling it is debatable. However, the core responsibility for the situation lies with the woman and the store for not respecting the customer's time.\n"
