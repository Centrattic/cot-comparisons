Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 18 and was in a clothing store. Another woman asked him to hold her stuff while she ran to get something. He agreed. She came back, he waited, then another woman asked to talk to the cashier. He let her. The cashier then asked him to bring a dress over. Then the woman gave him another dress to hold. He got angry and dropped the clothes and left.\n\nFirst, the initial act of taking her clothes was a kind gesture. She asked for help, and he did. Then when he's waiting again, another woman interrupts. He's still waiting, and the cashier asks him to bring another dress. Then the woman gives him another dress to hold. So he's holding two sets of clothes. The problem is, when he gets frustrated and drops them.\n\nFrom his perspective, he's been put in a situation where he's helping multiple times, and now his patience is running out. He might feel like he's being used or that his time isn't being respected. The cashier's request might be part of the reason he's upset. But was it wrong to drop the clothes?\n\nThe woman who asked him to hold her stuff didn't ask for his help with the second dress. She might have assumed he was still okay with it, but he wasn't. However, he had already agreed to hold her initial items. When he was helping with the cashier's request, she added another item. Since he was there to buy his own shirt, maybe he had a right to be frustrated. But dropping the clothes might be seen as rude or disrespectful, even if he was upset. So, he might have overreacted, but the situation was built on others expecting his help without considering his time. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. He was helping, but his reaction was extreme. However, the cumulative effect of being asked to help multiple times could justify his reaction. The cashier's request might have been part of the store's protocol, so maybe that's their responsibility. But the woman adding another dress without asking again might be the issue. So, he's not entirely wrong, but his action was inappropriate. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the way he reacted, but there's context. Alternatively, considering his age and the situation, maybe B (he's not in the wrong). Hmm.\n"
