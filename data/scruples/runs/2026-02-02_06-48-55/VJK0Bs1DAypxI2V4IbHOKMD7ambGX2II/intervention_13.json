Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person was in a clothing store, waiting in line. A woman asked them to hold her stuff while she went to get something else. They agreed, which is probably a normal thing to do. Then when the woman came back, she asked again for the author to hold another dress. The author got annoyed and dropped the clothes and left.\n\nFirst, the woman asked for help initially, which the author provided. Then, after the woman and the cashier went to look at dresses, the cashier asked the author to bring over the dress that was on the counter. Then the woman gave another dress to hold. The author felt frustrated and left by dropping the clothes.\n\nHmm, so the key points here: was the author justified in their reaction? The woman was being asked to hold more items, but was she being reasonable? The cashier might have been busy, so maybe the woman was using the author as a helper instead of dealing with the task themselves. The author got tired of waiting and decided to leave. But dropping the clothes on the floor might be seen as disrespectful or causing damage. Also, the woman was probably just trying to get help, but the author's reaction was abrupt.\n\nThe author was in a situation where they were in line, waiting, and being asked to hold multiple items. It's possible that the woman and the cashier were using the author as a helper, which isn't their responsibility. However, the author's response was to drop the clothes and leave, which could be seen as a breach of etiquette. Even if the situation was frustrating, there might have been more appropriate ways to handle it, like asking to be allowed to check out first or politely declining further help. \n\nBut considering the author is 18 and the woman was in the store, maybe the woman didn't realize she was overstepping. Still, the author's action of dropping the clothes could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because the situation was unfair, but their actions might have been an overreaction. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they chose to leave in a way that could be disrespectful, maybe they are in the wrong. So I think the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
