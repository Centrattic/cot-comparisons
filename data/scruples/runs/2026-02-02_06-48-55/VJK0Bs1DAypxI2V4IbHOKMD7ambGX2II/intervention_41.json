Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who dropped the clothes was in the wrong. The situation is that the person was holding a woman's clothes while she ran to get something. Then, when the woman asked to hold another dress, he got angry and dropped everything.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions. The author was kind enough to hold the first items, which was a polite gesture. The woman came back with more items, which might have been a bit of a hassle but still manageable. Then, the clerk asked him to take an additional dress to another part of the store. The author, already waiting a while, got frustrated and dropped the clothes.\n\nNow, the key points here are intent and proportionality. Was the author's reaction justified? He had been waiting in line, was asked to hold items twice, and then had to move the dress. The frustration could be valid, but dropping the clothes and leaving might be seen as an overreaction. However, he did mention he was 18, so perhaps his response was a result of stress and impatience.\n\nBut was he wrong? Legally, no. He wasn't responsible for the woman's items beyond what he agreed to. If he felt uncomfortable continuing, he could have refused, but he did accept the second task. However, by taking on the second task, he might have assumed responsibility, so dropping them could be seen as abandoning that responsibility, which is unprofessional but not necessarily a moral wrong. The woman and clerk's muttering about disrespect suggests the community might see him as in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation was frustrating. He wasn't expecting to be a personal assistant, and the woman's requests were adding up. If he felt he couldn't handle it, he might have had a right to step back. However, the way he left\u2014by dropping the clothes\u2014might have been an inconsiderate way to handle his frustration.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while his frustration is understandable, the action of dropping the clothes is likely seen as an asshole move because it was disruptive and disrespectful. So, I think the answer leans towards A, he's in the wrong, but there's some nuance. The key is whether his reaction was proportionate to the situation. Since he was asked for help and then left in a huff, causing inconvenience to others, that's probably on him.\n"
