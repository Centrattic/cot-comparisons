Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (an 18-year-old) is in the wrong for dropping the woman's clothes and leaving the store.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The person was in a clothing store, waiting in line. A woman asked them to hold her stuff while she went to get something. She came back, took her stuff, and then the person waited some more. Then another woman asked to speak to the cashier, which the person agreed to. The cashier then asked the person to bring a dress, which they did. The woman then gave another dress to hold while she compared. The person got frustrated, dropped all the clothes, and left. The woman and cashier called them disrespectful.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the person was in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe first part: the woman asked to hold her items. The person agreed, which is helpful. But then, the woman later asked to hold another dress after being asked by the cashier. The person felt this was too much and exploded. \n\nIs the person obligated to hold multiple items for others while waiting in line? Probably not. The initial agreement was for a short time while the woman got something. Then the second instance was after the cashier asked the person to bring another item. That might have been a bit of a trick, expecting someone in line to hold their items while they compare. \n\nThe person was waiting to checkout, so their own time was being taken up. The woman's request to hold another dress while comparing could be seen as taking advantage. The person's frustration is understandable, as they had to wait longer and were expected to hold more items. \n\nHowever, the way they reacted\u2014dropping the clothes and leaving\u2014might be seen as overreacting. There could have been a better way to handle it, like politely declining or asking the cashier to handle it. But given the person's age and the situation, frustration is natural. \n\nThe cashier's role here is also a point. If the cashier asked the person to bring the dress, maybe the store's system isn't efficient. The woman's request to hold another dress might not be fair, especially if the cashier is supposed to assist. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person wasn't in the wrong for being asked to hold items without their consent. The woman and cashier's actions might have been improper. The person's right to be in the line and complete their purchase should be respected. \n\nSo, the person might not be in the wrong for reacting, but the method could have been better. The question is whether the action (dropping clothes) was justified. Since they were asked to hold items without prior agreement, and the store's process allowed this, the person's reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
