Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a teenager helping a woman hold her clothes, then getting annoyed when the woman asks for more help and he drops the clothes and leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The writer was in a store, waiting in line. The woman asked him to hold her stuff while she ran to get something. He agreed. She came back, took her items, and then later, the woman behind him asked to ask the cashier a question. The writer was okay with that. Then the cashier asked him to bring another dress, which he did. Then the woman gave him another dress to hold. He got angry, dropped everything, and left.\n\nSo, did he do the right thing? Let's think about the key points here. The writer helped the woman twice. First, holding her clothes when she left the line, then bringing a dress. The second time, he was asked to hold another dress while the women discussed. The writer felt wronged and left in frustration.\n\nThe woman's actions might be seen as taking advantage. She asked for help more than once, and maybe the writer felt it was too much. But the question is whether he was in the wrong. \n\nFrom the writer's perspective, he was in line to buy something. The woman's actions disrupted his turn. When he was asked to hold more items, he might have felt that his patience was over. But was he justified in dropping the clothes? Dropping items could be seen as disrespectful, even if he was upset. \n\nBut then again, the woman didn't ask for his help the second time. The cashier actually asked him to bring the dress. So maybe the woman was expecting him to hold it. However, the writer might have felt that after two interruptions, he had the right to leave. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the writer could be seen as in the right because he was being asked to help repeatedly without compensation. However, his reaction of dropping the clothes might be seen as disproportionate. But considering he had already helped twice and was in line, his frustration is understandable. \n\nThe cashier might have been responsible for managing the situation, not the customer. The writer's action was a reaction to being asked to hold more items while he was in line. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut the store might have policies about customers handling items. If he dropped the clothes, that could be an issue. However, the main conflict was with the women, not the store's policies. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer's actions were a result of being taken advantage of, and while his reaction was abrupt, the women's behavior might have been the root cause. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
