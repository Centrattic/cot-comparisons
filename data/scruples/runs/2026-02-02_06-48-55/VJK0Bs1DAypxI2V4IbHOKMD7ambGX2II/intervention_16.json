Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author was in the wrong when they dropped the woman's clothes and left the store.\n\nFirst, the author was in a line at a clothing store. The woman asked to hold her stuff while she ran to get something. The author agreed, which was kind. Then, later, after the woman came back, the author let her go ahead to ask a question. The author waited, and then the store employee asked to bring over the dress from the counter. The author did that, but then the woman gave another dress to hold. At that point, the author got angry and left, dropping the clothes.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions and their justification. The author had already been asked to hold items twice\u2014once by the woman and then by the employee. The woman then asked to hold another dress. The author, feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, decided to leave.\n\nOn one hand, the author was being helpful initially. They allowed the woman to go ahead, even though it delayed their own checkout. The store employee asked for help, which the author provided. However, when the woman gave another item to hold, the author snapped. The question is whether that reaction was justified.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong: They were in a public place, and their actions (dropping clothes) could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate. The woman was a customer, and even though the situation was frustrating, the author could have handled it differently, like politely declining further assistance instead of leaving abruptly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was a young person (18) with a legitimate frustration after waiting a long time. The woman and employee kept adding tasks to the author without considering their own position in the line. The author had already been accommodating twice, so the third time might have been the last straw. The author's actions could be seen as a reaction to being taken advantage of, especially if the woman expected the author to hold multiple items indefinitely.\n\nBut the store employee asked for the help, which is part of their job. However, the woman wasn't the employee; she was a customer. The customer might not have the right to make the author hold items. The employee could have handled the situation, but instead, they involved the author. The author might feel that they were being used as a helper without consent after the second time.\n\nThe main issue is the author's response. Dropping the clothes and leaving might be seen as an overreaction, especially in a public space. There are better ways to handle frustration, like politely declining further assistance or speaking to a manager. However, given the context, some might empathize with the author's frustration, especially if the store's staff wasn't managing the situation well.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected to stay calm and find a solution rather than escalate the situation. The author's action could be seen as disrespectful towards the customer, even if they were frustrated. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more gracefully. But the other party also might have overstepped by expecting the author to keep helping. However, the author's action directly caused the problem, so the responsibility lies more with them.\n"
