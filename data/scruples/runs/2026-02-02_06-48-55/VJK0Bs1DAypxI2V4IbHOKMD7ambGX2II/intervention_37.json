Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for dropping the woman's clothes and leaving the store. The story is presented in a \"Am I the Asshole?\" format, so the community usually evaluates based on social norms and expectations.\n\nFirst, the author is 18, which might be considered a younger age where people are still learning social etiquette, but age alone isn't a factor in determining right or wrong here. The key points are the actions taken and the reasons behind them.\n\nThe author was in a clothing store, helping a woman hold her items while she was in line. The woman asked the author to hold her stuff twice: once initially when she left to grab more clothes, and then again later when the store employee asked the author to bring another dress. The author became frustrated with the wait, got angry, and dropped the clothes, then left. The woman and the employee muttered about the author being disrespectful.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's break down the actions:\n\n1. Helping the woman hold her clothes the first time. That seems reasonable and polite. The woman was in line, asked for help, and the author complied. No issue there.\n\n2. When the woman asked again to hold another dress for her and the employee. The author was already waiting in line, possibly for some time, and then had to wait longer because of this additional task. The author was not obligated to help further. However, the way the author reacted\u2014getting angry and dropping the clothes\u2014could be seen as overreacting. \n\nThe frustration is understandable. The author had to wait in line, then wait again for the woman to come back, then wait for the employee to ask to move the dress, and then another request. The author might feel that their patience was exceeded. However, even if someone is frustrated, throwing the clothes on the floor and leaving could be considered disrespectful and inconsiderate, regardless of the situation.\n\nThe key here is the method of handling the situation. Instead of just dropping the clothes, the author could have politely declined the second request or waited a bit longer. The action of dropping the items and leaving without addressing the situation directly might come off as rude. The store employees might have been relying on the author to assist, and the author's abrupt departure could cause inconvenience.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman and the employee did ask the author to hold the clothes without offering compensation or even a clear sense of time. The author might not have been aware that they were expected to help indefinitely. However, even if they were annoyed, the appropriate response would be to communicate that politely rather than act out in frustration.\n\nSo, considering all that, while the author had a valid reason to be frustrated, the way they handled it was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
