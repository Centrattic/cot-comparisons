Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author was helping a woman hold her clothes while she went to get something, then later the woman asked him to hold another dress after she and the cashier went to look at dresses. Then he dropped the clothes and left. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the scenario. The woman first asked for help holding her stuff, and he agreed. Then, later, she asked him to hold another dress while she compared options. The author got frustrated and left. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's at fault. Let's break it down. When the woman first asked for help, he was doing a favor. She came back with more clothes, and he accepted that. Then, when she asked to hold another dress, he might have felt that his patience was exceeded. But was it reasonable to drop the clothes and leave? \n\nIn public places, when someone asks for a favor, there's usually an expectation that you'll hold the items for a reasonable amount of time, but the author was waiting in line and had his own purchase to make. The woman's second request was after he had waited already. However, the cashier also asked him to hold the dress, which might be part of the store's process. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author acted inconsiderately. He agreed to the first request, but when asked again, he was upset and left. Maybe he should have said no the second time instead of just leaving. Dropping the clothes could be seen as rude, even if he was frustrated. People might expect that if they're holding items, they should at least return them politely, even if they decline further help.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman was being inconsiderate by making him hold multiple items without asking his willingness. The author's frustration is understandable, but the action of dropping the clothes and leaving might be the part where he's wrong. He could have handled it better by politely declining the second time and continuing with his own purchase. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation calmly. While the woman's requests were perhaps excessive, reacting by dropping the clothes and leaving is disrespectful. The right move would have been to say \"no\" or inform the cashier he can't help anymore, not to act out in frustration.\n"
