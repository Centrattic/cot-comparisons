Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old, was in a clothing store and helped a woman hold her stuff while she ran to get something. The woman came back, and then later, the author was asked to wait again so another customer could ask the cashier a question. The cashier then asked the author to carry a dress, and then another one, leading the author to drop the clothes and leave, causing a scene.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations and norms here. The author offered help initially, which was a kind gesture. The woman asked to hold her stuff, and the author agreed. Then, when the other woman asked to wait so she could ask a question, the author agreed again. However, when the cashier came in and asked the author to carry the dress, and then another one, the author felt pushed further. The key point here is whether the cashier's request was reasonable and if the author had the right to refuse.\n\nThe store's cashier might not have asked the author directly but assumed the author would carry the dress. The author might have felt that their patience was exhausted after waiting for the first woman and then being asked to carry the dress. However, the author's reaction of dropping the clothes and leaving might be seen as overreacting. While the author might have been frustrated, using the store's property and the women's belongings in such a way could be considered disrespectful or inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier might have been asking the author to do something that wasn't their responsibility, like carrying clothes for another customer. The author might not be obligated to help beyond what they already did. But the act of dropping the clothes and leaving without a word could come across as rude, even if the author felt wronged. \n\nThe author's age might play a role in their perception of the situation. At 18, they might be more sensitive to being treated as a helper. The women, especially the cashier, might not have realized the author was still waiting to check out, so their request could have been thoughtless. However, the author's response was abrupt and potentially damaging to the store's property and the customers' items.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person's actions, even if justified in their mind, were socially acceptable. Dropping clothes and leaving without a word is generally seen as rude, regardless of the reason. The author might not be the \"asshole\" for being frustrated, but the way they expressed it could be where they're in the wrong. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because of the reaction, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) because of the unreasonable requests.\n"
