Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is 18 and was in a clothing store. He was holding a woman's clothes while she stepped away. Then, when he was about to check out, another woman asked to talk to the cashier, which delayed him further. After that, the cashier asked him to bring a dress over, and then the customer made him hold another dress. He got angry, dropped the clothes, and left.\n\nFirst, the initial act of holding the woman's clothes was a kind gesture. She came back with more items, which might have been a bit much, but he didn't object then. The second delay was when the other customer asked the cashier a question. The user agreed, so that's his choice. Then, the cashier handed him another dress to hold. That's when he snapped.\n\nThe key points are: he was waiting a while, being asked to hold more items, and the accumulation of delays. But was it reasonable for him to explode? Well, he was holding items for a customer, which is part of helping, but he wasn't obligated to do so. The cashier might have been asking him to assist, but if he didn't want to, he could have said no. However, he chose to get angry and drop the clothes. That action is disrespectful and could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the cashier might be part of the staff handling the situation. The store isn't responsible for the delays caused by other customers, but the user's reaction is impulsive and unprofessional. So, he's in the wrong for losing his temper and causing a scene. The answer is A.\n"
