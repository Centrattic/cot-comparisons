Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was in a clothing store, waiting in line. A woman asked him to hold her stuff while she went to grab something else. He agreed. Then later, another woman asked him to hold a dress while she asked the cashier a question. He said okay again. Then the cashier asked him to bring over the dress from the counter. He did that, but then the woman gave him another dress to hold. He got angry and dropped the clothes and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of everyone involved. The author was asked to hold items twice, once by the same woman who asked initially and then the other woman. The cashier then asked him to bring over the dress on the counter. The author did that, and then the woman gave him another dress to hold. At that point, he exploded and left. \n\nThe key points here are: the author was being asked to hold multiple items without being compensated. The first time, the woman he helped was someone he agreed to help. The second time, the cashier asked him to bring the dress over, which might be part of the store's process. Then the woman gave him another dress to hold, which he didn't agree to but did so. Then he got angry and left. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, he wasn't in a rush initially when the first woman asked. He agreed to help. The second time, the woman asked to hold the dress while she asked the cashier a question. He might have thought it was a quick favor. But then the cashier asked him to bring the dress from the counter, which he did, and then the woman gave him another dress. That seems like she was exploiting his willingness to help. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He was asked to hold multiple items without any compensation. However, when he dropped the clothes and left, that could be seen as a rude and impulsive reaction. Even though he was frustrated, the appropriate response might have been to politely refuse or explain that he couldn't hold more items. \n\nBut maybe the store's staff was also at fault for not handling the situation. If the cashier asked him to bring the dress over, maybe he was supposed to wait for the cashier to handle that. The woman giving him another dress without asking if he wanted to hold it might have crossed a line. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction of dropping the clothes and leaving might be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful, regardless of the provocation. Even if he was upset, the way he reacted could be seen as an asshole move because he caused a mess and left without resolving the situation properly. \n\nBut then again, the woman might have been trying to take advantage of him. The author was being asked to hold items he wasn't responsible for, and his frustration is valid. \n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone is waiting in line and is asked to hold items multiple times, they have the right to say no. But the author's reaction was to drop them and leave, which is more extreme. So maybe the author is partially at fault because he could have handled it more politely. \n\nAlternatively, if the store staff was supposed to handle that, then the woman shouldn't have been asking him to hold the items. The cashier's involvement in asking him to bring the dress might have set up a situation where the author was in the middle of the store's process. \n\nBut the key is that the author was not a customer in that transaction; he was just a customer waiting to check out. The women were treating him as a personal assistant without his consent. So the author's frustration is justified, but the way he reacted might not be. \n\nSo the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because he reacted inconsiderately, or B (not in the wrong) because the women were taking advantage of him. It's a bit of a toss-up. But the community often leans towards the idea that if someone is being asked to do something unreasonable, they have the right to decline, but the method of declining is important. Dropping the clothes and leaving might be seen as an asshole move, so A might be the answer. But some might argue B because the women were using him. \n\nI think the consensus would be A because the author's reaction was inappropriate, even if the situation was frustrating. He could have walked away without making a mess.\n"
