Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a teenager who holds someone else's clothes while waiting in line, then gets asked to hold more items, leading to frustration and an outburst.\n\nFirst, the initial act of helping the woman by holding her clothes was a kind gesture. The author didn't have to do that but chose to help out. Then, when the woman asked again to hold another dress, the situation escalated. The author was already waiting for a long time, and the store had only one cashier, which might have contributed to the delay.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to refuse. The author was asked to hold the first set of clothes, which they agreed to. The second time, the woman asked again without the author's consent. The author felt it was too much and left. The question is whether the author overstepped by dropping the clothes and leaving.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the author was within their right to refuse further help, the method of doing so\u2014by dropping the clothes and leaving\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. However, considering the context of being asked twice without consent, especially after already waiting a long time, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nThe store staff also played a role by asking the author to hold the dress, which might have added to the pressure. The author's actions, while impulsive, might be seen as a reaction to being overburdened without consent. However, the act of dropping the clothes could be considered inconsiderate, regardless of the provocation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author wasn't in the wrong for refusing to hold the clothes anymore, but the way they did it might be seen as rude. The woman might feel disrespected, but the author had a valid reason for being frustrated. So, it's a judgment call. Some might say the author was justified in their actions, while others might argue they should have handled it more politely.\n"
