Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (a 18-year-old) was in the wrong for dropping the woman's clothes and leaving the store. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a clothing store, waiting in line. A woman behind him asked him to hold her stuff while she grabbed something. He agreed. When she came back, he continued waiting. Then another woman asked to talk to the cashier first, which the author let happen. Later, the cashier asked him to bring a dress, which he did. The woman then asked him to hold another dress. He got frustrated and dropped the clothes, left. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nLet's break down the key points. The woman initially asked him to hold her stuff, which he did. Then another customer cut in, but maybe the cashier handled that. The cashier then asked him to bring a dress, which he did. Then the woman gave him another dress to hold. \n\nThe author's frustration might be understandable because he had to wait longer than expected. However, the act of dropping someone's clothes is a physical action that could damage items or be seen as rude. The woman might have been in a hurry, but demanding him to hold another dress without asking if he was okay with it could be part of the problem. \n\nBut the author had already been helping twice. The first time was a favor, and the second time the cashier asked. The third time, the woman just gave him another dress without asking. Maybe the author felt overused. However, even if frustrated, dropping the clothes is not the best response. There could have been a way to politely decline or ask for help. \n\nThe woman might have been in a situation where she needed assistance, but the author's reaction was impulsive. The cashier might have been busy, so maybe the woman was trying to help. Still, the author's action caused a scene and potential damage. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author was in the right to feel frustrated but not in the right to act out. The question is whether the action makes him the asshole. The woman might not have been in the wrong for asking, but the author's response was inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because the action of dropping clothes is unprofessional and could be seen as disrespectful, even if he was frustrated. So Answer A.\n"
