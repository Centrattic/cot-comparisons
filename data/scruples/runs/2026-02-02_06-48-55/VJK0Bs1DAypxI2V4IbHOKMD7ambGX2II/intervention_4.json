Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (TA) is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the sequence of events. The TA was in line at a clothing store. A woman asked to hold her stuff while she ran to get something. He agreed, which seems kind. Then she comes back, takes her items, and later the same woman asks the cashier a question, making the TA wait. The cashier then asks the TA to carry the dress over. The woman then gives him another dress to hold. The TA got angry, dropped the clothes, and left, leading to the woman muttering about him being disrespectful.\n\nSo the key points here: Did the TA act inconsiderately? Let's see. Initially, he helped the woman by holding her items. Then, when the woman asked the cashier a question, which was a small inconvenience. Then the cashier asked him to bring the dress over, which is part of the store's process. The woman then gives him another dress to hold. The TA, already waiting and frustrated, drops the clothes and leaves.\n\nNow, considering the TA's perspective: He was in line, waiting, and was made to wait longer. The woman asked him to hold more items on top of what he was already holding. That might have been the last straw. But the TA was a customer, not an employee. The cashier asked him to carry the dress, which he did. Then the woman added another dress. Is it unreasonable for her to ask that? Or is the TA overstepping by holding onto items he wasn't responsible for after the cashier asked him to carry the first one?\n\nWait, when the cashier asked him to bring the dress over, maybe she was just moving it from the counter to where the woman was. Then the woman gives him another dress. Maybe the TA felt that he was being asked to do more than just help once. But at that point, he was holding two dresses, which isn't the customer's responsibility. So the TA might have felt that the woman was taking advantage of him. \n\nBut the TA agreed to help initially. However, when the woman asked for more help with the second dress, maybe he was under no obligation to comply. The problem is that he dropped the clothes and left, which could be seen as rude. Even if he was upset, the action of dropping the clothes might be considered disrespectful or inconsiderate. The woman might have expected him to either politely decline the second request or leave if he didn't want to help further. Instead, he reacted by dropping the items, which could be seen as an overreaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the TA was a customer in a store, and the woman's request might not have been reasonable. He had already helped once, and being asked to hold another item could be seen as unreasonable. The fact that he left after that might be justified, but the method of leaving (dropping the clothes) is problematic. The TA might have been within his rights to refuse, but the way he did it was inappropriate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether the TA's actions were a reasonable response to being asked to hold more items. Since he was a customer, he wasn't obligated to help beyond the first time. However, dropping the clothes was a harsh way to respond, even if he felt wronged. The woman might have felt the TA was being rude. The TA might have been justified in refusing but chose an inconsiderate method. Therefore, the TA could be in the wrong for the way he reacted, even if the situation was frustrating."
