Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person was in a clothing store, helping a woman hold her stuff while she went to get something. Then, when the author was about to check out, another woman asked to ask the cashier a question. The author agreed, but then the cashier and the other woman went to look at dresses, making the author wait longer. Eventually, the cashier asked the author to bring a dress over, and then asked to hold another one. The author got frustrated and dropped the clothes and left, leading to some backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of the author. The author initially helped the first woman by holding her items, which was a kind gesture. Then, when the second woman asked to ask the cashier a question, the author agreed again, which seems polite. However, the cashier then asked the author to bring over a dress that was on the counter, and later to hold another dress. The author felt that this was pushing their patience, leading to frustration and the decision to leave abruptly.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that they were being treated as a helper without consent. They had already been waiting a long time, and the cashier's request to hold another dress might have felt like an overstep. The author could argue that they were not obligated to assist further, especially since they were there to shop and were being delayed. Dropping the clothes and leaving might be seen as a reaction to being taken advantage of, but it's a drastic action that could be considered disrespectful, as it involved damaging the store's property and potentially causing inconvenience.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier might have assumed that the author was willing to help, given the previous assistance. However, the cashier should have asked for permission rather than making the author hold another dress without consent. The author's frustration is understandable, but the act of dropping the clothes and leaving could be seen as a breach of etiquette and possibly even disorderly conduct, depending on the store's policies.\n\nIt's important to note that while the author's actions were impulsive, the situation involved a lot of waiting and unexpected responsibilities. However, the appropriate response would have been to politely decline further assistance and proceed to check out, even if that meant waiting a bit longer or finding a manager to resolve the issue. Throwing the clothes is not a constructive solution and could be viewed as inconsiderate or aggressive.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were put in an awkward situation where they were being asked to help beyond what was reasonable. However, their method of handling it was poor. The cashier and the other woman's actions contributed to the frustration, but the author's reaction could still be seen as inappropriate regardless of the circumstances. Therefore, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were justified given the context.\n"
