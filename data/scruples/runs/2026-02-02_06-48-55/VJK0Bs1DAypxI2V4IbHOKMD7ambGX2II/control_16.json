Behind me in line is a woman maybe 22 or 23. She taps me on the shoulder and says, \"Hey, I need to run and grab something I forgot really quick, would you mind holding my stuff for just a sec?\" I say okay, happy to help out. There's a lot of line left anyway.\n\nShe comes back after five minutes with some more clothes, and takes what I was holding back, thanking me. I waited in line some more, and when I was about to get to the register the woman behind me asks if she can \"really quickly\" ask the lady at the register (the only one working there) a question before I check out. I say okay, I don't mind. \n\nShe asks the lady at the register something about a dress she wanted to buy, then they put it down on the counter, and both went to the other side of the store to look at the dresses.\n\nI'm just still waiting, thinking I guess I don't mind that much. Then the lady that works there popped her head around the corner and asked me, since I was the only one there, to bring the dress that was on the counter over. I bring it over to them, and while I'm standing there, they start comparing that dress to another one.  Then the woman picks out another dress, hands it to me, saying \"here, hold this too,\" while i'm still standing there like an idiot.\n\nI got pissed off and tired of waiting, so I just dropped all the clothes on the floor and left the store. They were muttering about me being disrespectful as I left.\n\nIt was one of the oddest and most frustrating experiences I've had at a clothes store. Was I an asshole for exploding off like that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the 18-year-old) is in the wrong for dropping the woman's clothes and leaving the store.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a clothing store, helping a woman by holding her items while she ran to get something. The woman then asked another customer in line to hold her stuff while she asked a question. Then both went to look at dresses, left their items on the counter. The store employee asked the author to bring the dress over. Then the woman gave another dress to the author to hold. The author got angry and left.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author was kind enough to help the woman initially. The woman then asked someone else (the person behind the author in line) to hold her stuff while she asked a question. That person might have been in line, so maybe they were okay to help briefly. But then both the woman and the employee went to look at dresses, leaving their items on the counter. The employee then comes back and asks the author to bring the dress, which the author does. Then the woman gives another dress to the author. At this point, the author is still waiting to check out, but now has two other people's clothes to hold. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author was being helpful, but after a point, they had their own items to check out. The employee asked the author to bring the dress, which was part of their job? Or was the employee just asking the customer to help? If the employee is the one handling the transaction, maybe the customer shouldn't have to hold items beyond a certain point. The author was already waiting a long time, and being asked to hold more clothes might be the last straw. \n\nBut maybe the author overreacted by dropping the clothes. Even if they were frustrated, throwing items is not a good way to handle it. However, the woman was asking for help from multiple people, including the employee, which might have been part of the issue. The employee might have been supposed to handle the transactions, not the customers. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they were being helpful but had their own purchase to make. The employee might not have been doing their job properly by involving customers. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of dealing with it (throwing clothes) is not. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they could have handled it differently, even if they felt wronged. Alternatively, maybe the employee was asking the customer to do their job, which is not right.\n\nHmm. The key factors here are whether the author had a right to refuse, and whether their reaction was excessive. Since they were in line to check out, and the employee asked them to bring items, maybe the employee was supposed to handle that. The author was being accommodating, but eventually, their patience ran out. However, the act of dropping the clothes is not acceptable, regardless of the reason. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because their reaction was inappropriate, even if they were frustrated.\n"
