Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who made a joke about an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old was in the wrong. The situation is they were on a school trip with friends, and they made a joke pointing out Ashley's relationship with a 14-year-old. The user says it was in a joking tone, part of their usual banter, but Ashley got angry and others said it was too far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user argues that dating a 14-year-old is creepy, and others would react if the genders were reversed. But the key here is whether the joke was appropriate. Even if the user believes the relationship is problematic, making a joke about it in a group setting might be crossing a line.\n\nThe age difference here is four years. In some places, it's legal depending on the laws, but societal norms might still view it as a significant age gap. However, the user's intention was to make a jab as part of their usual teasing. The problem is that the subject of the joke (Ashley) took it personally and was upset. Even if the user didn't mean to attack, the content of the joke could be sensitive. Mentioning the age gap directly might touch on something that's not okay to joke about, regardless of the legal status.\n\nAlso, the fact that Ashley was already involved in some drama with other girls might have made her more defensive. The user's comment added fuel to the fire, even if it was a joke. Friends might have different boundaries about what's acceptable to joke about. The user might not be aware that this particular topic is a sensitive one for Ashley, so they crossed a boundary unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might feel they were just being honest or pointing out a reality. But humor often depends on context and the audience's comfort. If the group said it was \"too far,\" that's a sign that the user overstepped. The reaction of the group and Ashley indicates that the joke wasn't well-received, even if they moved on quickly.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user might be in the wrong because the joke targeted a sensitive issue (age gap in a relationship) that could be seen as inappropriate, even if it's legal. The fact that others got mad and Ashley was angry suggests that the user's comment went beyond acceptable teasing.\n"
