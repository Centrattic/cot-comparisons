Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a group of friends on a school trip, and the author made a joke about Ashley, who's 18 and dating a 14-year-old. Even though the age difference is legal where they live, the author called out Ashley for dating the 14-year-old in a joking manner. The group got mad, and Ashley flipped them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that Ashley was already involved in drama with other girls over the same boy. The author made a joke implying Ashley was insecure by dating a 14-year-old. Even if it was a joke, the subject matter is sensitive. Legally, it's okay, but socially, there might be a double standard. The user also points out that if the genders were reversed, people would find it creepy, which suggests there's a societal bias here.\n\nThe key points are: the author's intention was to joke, but the topic is age-gap relationships, which can be a sensitive issue. Even if the author didn't mean to attack, the comment might have crossed a line. Friends might feel it's an invasion of privacy or that the author is judging Ashley's personal life. Also, the reaction was strong: Ashley flipped them off, others chided the author, but then they laughed it off. The author might think the joke was in line with their usual banter, but the subject here is more contentious.\n\nI need to evaluate if making a joke about someone's romantic partner, especially when it's a legal but age-disparate relationship, is crossing the line. Even in a group that's used to teasing, not all topics are fair game. The author's comment could be seen as targeting Ashley's personal life, which might be more hurtful than a typical joke. The fact that Ashley took it seriously and the group reacted negatively suggests that the author's joke was inappropriate.\n\nAlso, considering societal norms, even if it's legal, there's a perception that a 14-year-old is underage, and an 18-year-old is significantly older. The author's comment might have highlighted a power dynamic or age difference that others found uncomfortable. The author's argument that it's creepy if reversed might not hold because societal attitudes often treat older men with younger women differently than the reverse. But that doesn't justify the joke if it's hurtful.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to be mean, the comment was about Ashley's relationship, which is a personal matter. Friends might have a limit on what's acceptable to joke about. Therefore, the author's joke was inconsiderate and crossed the line, making them at fault.\n"
