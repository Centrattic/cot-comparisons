Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who made a joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context: They're on a school trip with friends who joke a lot. Ashley, 18, is dating a 14-year-old. In their location, that's legal. Before this, two other girls (16/17) also dated the same boy. He had a fling with one and then started with Ashley. The person made a joke in a group conversation, saying Ashley and the others were insecure, leading to Ashley flipping them off and others getting upset.\n\nThe key points here are legality versus social norms. Legally, it's allowed where they are, but socially, there's a difference. The user argues it's creepy and that the joke was just a lighthearted jab. However, the joke specifically called out Ashley's partner's age, which might have crossed a line even in a joking context.\n\nEven in a group that's used to joking, the subject of Ashley's relationship age could be sensitive. The fact that Ashley reacted strongly by flipping them off suggests the joke made her uncomfortable. Others also said it was \"too far,\" indicating that the group's social norms consider this topic off-limits.\n\nWhile the user claims it was in good fun, the content of the joke targets a potentially sensitive issue (age gap in a relationship) which, even if true, might not be appropriate to joke about in that way. The humor here could be seen as mocking Ashley's choice, which might not be fair even if the relationship is legal. The user's argument that it would be different if the genders were reversed is about societal perceptions, but that doesn't necessarily justify the joke in this context.\n\nSo, considering the social dynamics and the immediate negative reaction, the user likely overstepped, even if it was a joke. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
