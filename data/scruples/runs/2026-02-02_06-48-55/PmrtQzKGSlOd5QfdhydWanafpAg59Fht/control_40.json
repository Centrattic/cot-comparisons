Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for jokingly calling out their friend Ashley for dating a 14-year-old. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the user is in a group setting with friends where they often joke around. The joke was made in a lighthearted way, but Ashley took offense. The key points here are the context of the conversation, the relationship dynamics, and the legal aspect of the age difference.\n\nLegally, in some places, a 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old might be allowed, but socially, it's often seen as inappropriate. The user's comment was a jab pointing out the age difference, which might have been meant as a joke but touched on a sensitive topic. The problem is that even if the user intended it as a joke, the subject matter is serious. Making fun of someone's relationship, especially one that's legally allowed but socially frowned upon, can be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the group dynamic is important. The user mentions that they and their friends often make fun of each other, but this time Ashley reacted strongly. The others also said it was \"too far,\" so the group's reaction might indicate that the joke crossed a line. Even if the user didn't mean to attack, the impact of the joke caused Ashley to be upset and lash out. The flip-flopping in the response (turning around, flipping off) suggests that the joke was more offensive than the user intended.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison the user mentions\u2014how the reaction would be different if the genders were reversed. That's a valid point about potential double standards, but the issue here is whether the joke itself was appropriate. Even if there's a double standard, making a joke that could be seen as promoting judgment or hypocrisy might still be problematic in a personal friend group.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intention was to joke, the subject matter and the way Ashley reacted suggest that the joke went too far. The author might not have realized the sensitivity of the situation, but since the group felt it was \"too far,\" it's likely the user was in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
