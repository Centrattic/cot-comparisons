Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're on a school trip with friends, and there's a lot of joking around. Ashley, who's 18, is dating a 14-year-old, which is legal where they live. The author made a joke about Ashley being insecure because she dated the 14-year-old, which caused Ashley to get angry and flip them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group is known for making jokes and teasing each other. The author says it was a joke, not meant to attack. But the subject is Ashley's relationship with someone much younger. Even if it's legal, there's a social aspect here. Dating a 14-year-old is a sensitive topic, especially when the age gap is so significant. People might find it uncomfortable regardless of the law.\n\nThe key points here: The author's comment was about Ashley dating a 14-year-old, which they framed as a joke. Ashley took offense and reacted strongly. The others in the group also said the comment was \"too far.\" Even though the author intended it as a joke, the line between a joke and a hurtful comment can be thin. \n\nEven in a group where teasing is common, some topics are off-limits. Insensitivity towards relationships, especially those with a large age gap, can be seen as crossing a line. The author might have thought the joke was in line with their usual banter, but others perceived it as crossing into personal and potentially harmful territory. \n\nAnother angle: the legal aspect doesn't necessarily align with social norms. Even if it's legal, societal views might still find the relationship questionable. The author's comment could be seen as highlighting Ashley's choice in a way that's judgmental, even if it's a joke. \n\nAlso, the immediate reaction of Ashley and the group suggests that the joke was not well-received. While the group moved on quickly, the strong reaction (flipping off) indicates that the author's comment was a misstep. It's possible that the author didn't consider how the joke would be taken, especially in a group where the relationship might be a sore spot for Ashley.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have intended to be malicious, the joke targeted a sensitive area that others found offensive. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
