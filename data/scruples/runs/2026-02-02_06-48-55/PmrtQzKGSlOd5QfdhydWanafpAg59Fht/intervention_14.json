Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for jokingly calling out a 18-year-old girl for dating a 14-year-old. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the context is a school trip with classmates who often joke around. The author made a joke in a group conversation where Ashley, who's 18, is dating a 14-year-old. The age difference is legal where they live, but there was prior drama with other girls also interested in the same boy. The author's joke was pointing out that all three girls (Ashley and the two juniors) were insecure because of their actions, and specifically called out Ashley for dating a 14-year-old. The tone was described as joking, but Ashley took offense and others were upset.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. Even though the age difference is legal, the act of dating a much younger person can be seen as inappropriate or creepy, especially in a high school context. The author's comment was a joke, but it targeted a sensitive topic. Even if the group is used to joking around, the subject here is a legal but ethically questionable situation. Jokes about sensitive topics can easily cross lines, especially when they involve minors and power dynamics. Ashley's reaction, including flipping off the author, suggests that she felt disrespected or embarrassed. The other group members also said it was \"too far,\" indicating that the joke went beyond what was acceptable for the group's standards.\n\nEven if the author's intention was lighthearted, the impact of the joke caused a negative reaction. The fact that Ashley felt the need to confront the author and others chided the comment implies that the author overstepped. It's possible that the author didn't realize how sensitive the topic was, but in a group setting, especially with a history of drama, making a joke about the age difference could be seen as disrespectful towards Ashley and her relationship. The author might have believed that the joke was fair given the prior drama, but the legal aspect doesn't negate the social implications. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that the comment was a harmless jab that was in line with the group's usual banter. However, the negative reaction suggests that the group found it inappropriate. The key factor here is whether the joke was in line with the group's norms and whether the author considered the potential hurtfulness of the comment. Since the author's joke specifically highlighted the age difference in a way that could be perceived as criticizing Ashley's choice, even in a joking manner, it's plausible that the author was in the wrong. The fact that the joke led to Ashley's anger and others' disapproval supports the idea that the author crossed a line, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
