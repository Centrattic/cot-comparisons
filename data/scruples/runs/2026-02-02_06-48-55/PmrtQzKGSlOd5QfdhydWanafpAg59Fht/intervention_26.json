Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author made a joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old. The key points here are that Ashley is 18, the boy is 14, and in their area, it's legal. The author says it was a joke, part of their usual banter with friends. But Ashley took offense, flipped the author off, and others got mad at the author. Now the author is wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nLegal age of consent is a factor here. If it's legal where they are, then technically Ashley isn't breaking the law. But the age difference is significant. The author's comment was \"date a 14 year old,\" implying it's creepy. The author argues that if genders were reversed, people would find it creepy. But the response from Ashley and others suggests that the comment was offensive, even if it's legal.\n\nThe group dynamic is important. They're friends who joke a lot, so the author might think it's just playful teasing. However, the line between a joke and an offensive comment can be thin, especially when it's about personal relationships. The author's comment targeted Ashley's personal choice, which could be seen as crossing the line, even in a joking manner. Ashley and others felt it was \"too far,\" leading to her flipping them off.\n\nAnother angle: the situation involved drama between Ashley and the two juniors. The author's comment grouped Ashley with the other two girls, which Ashley might have found unfair or an attack on her character. Even if it's a joke, grouping people in a negative way can be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Ashley wasn't being friendly about the other girls. So maybe there's some history here where Ashley was critical of others, and the author's joke was a callback to that. But in this case, the author directed the same criticism at Ashley, which she didn't like.\n\nThe author's intention was a joke, but the impact was negative. The fact that Ashley turned around and flipped them off, then others chided the author, indicates that the joke wasn't well-received. Even if they laughed it off later, the immediate reaction shows the comment was offensive.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's legal, there's a societal stigma around such a large age gap in relationships, especially when one is a minor. The author might have been reflecting that societal view, but doing so in a group setting where it's not appropriate could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nSo, the author might not have intended to be malicious, but the comment was hurtful. The question is whether the joke was in poor taste. Since it led to immediate negative reactions and Ashley felt targeted, the author could be in the wrong for making the comment, even as a joke. Jokes about someone's personal life, especially when it's a sensitive topic, can be seen as inconsiderate or cruel, regardless of the legal aspect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't mean to attack Ashley directly, the joke about her dating a minor (even if legal) was offensive and hurtful. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
