Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they made a joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old boy when she's 18. The context is a school trip with friends who often joke around. The author says it was a joke, part of their usual banter. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. The user mentions that in their location, an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old is legal. But even if it's legal, there's a big age gap. Some people might find it unethical or creepy, especially if there's a power imbalance. The other girls had also dated the same boy before, leading to drama. The author's comment was in response to Ashley complaining about the other girls, so they made a joke implying that Ashley is also insecure for dating a much younger boy.\n\nNow, the key points are: Was the joke in good faith? The author says it was a joke, part of their usual teasing. But the reaction was strong\u2014Ashley flipped them off and others said it was too far. The author is confused because they think it's creepy and would be different if the genders were reversed.\n\nI need to think about social norms. Even if legal, an 18-14 relationship might be seen as problematic. The author's joke might have crossed a line because it's sensitive. Friends might have boundaries about discussing others' relationships, especially when it's a legal but controversial age gap. The other people in the group might feel that the joke targeted Ashley personally, even if it was a joke. \n\nAlso, the way the joke was delivered\u2014calling her out in a group conversation where she wasn't expecting it\u2014could be seen as mean-spirited, even if the author intended it as a joke. The fact that Ashley was defensive and others took the author's side suggests that the joke was hurtful. \n\nEven if the author's intention was to point out the hypocrisy (since Ashley criticized others for being insecure), making a joke about someone's personal life in a way that's sensitive could be crossing a line. The key here is whether the joke was respectful and within the bounds of their usual teasing. If their usual banter is playful and mutual, but this particular joke touched on something sensitive and caused real hurt, then the author might be in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: The author might not realize the emotional impact. If Ashley was already sensitive about the situation (given the prior drama with other girls), bringing up the age gap in a joking manner could have been a trigger. The friends might have felt that the author was being cruel, even if it was a joke. \n\nSo, considering all this, even though the author thought it was a light-hearted jab, the subject matter was sensitive, and the reaction indicates that it went too far. Therefore, the author might be at fault here.\n"
