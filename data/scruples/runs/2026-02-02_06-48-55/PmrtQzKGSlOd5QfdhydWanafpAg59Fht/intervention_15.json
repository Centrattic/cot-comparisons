Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author was in the wrong for jokingly calling out an 18-year-old girl for dating a 14-year-old. The author is part of a group of friends on a school trip where they often joke around. The situation involves Ashley, who is 18 and dating a 14-year-old, which is legal where they live. The author made a joke implying that Ashley's dating choice might be due to insecurity, which upset Ashley and others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says it was a joke, part of their usual banter. But the subject here is Ashley's relationship with someone who's four years younger. Even though it's legal, there's a social taboo around such a significant age gap, especially when one is a minor. The author's comment could be seen as pointing out something that's socially sensitive, even if it's not illegal in their jurisdiction.\n\nThe key points to analyze: \n1. Was the joke appropriate given the context?\n2. Did the author cross a line by bringing up the age difference in a playful but public setting?\n3. The reaction of Ashley and others suggests that the joke was offensive, even if the author intended it as a light-hearted jab.\n\nEven if the author meant it as a joke, making fun of someone's personal life, especially involving age and relationships, can be hurtful. The fact that Ashley flipped them off and others said it was \"too far\" indicates that the group saw it as inappropriate. The author might not have intended harm, but the impact was negative. \n\nAlso, considering the legal aspect isn't the main issue here. The problem is more about social norms and how the joke was received. Since the group's reaction was negative, it's likely the author overstepped, even if their intention was to be funny. The fact that the joke led to tension and a direct insult from Ashley shows it wasn't well-received. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't mean to attack Ashley, the content of the joke touched on a sensitive topic that others found offensive. The answer here would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they made a joke about an age-discrepancy in a relationship, which, regardless of legality, can be seen as inappropriate in social contexts.\n"
