Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for jokingly calling out Ashley for dating a 14-year-old. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: in some places, a 14-year age gap might be legal if the older person is an adult, like 18. So Ashley isn't breaking the law here. But even if it's legal, people might still find it inappropriate or creepy, especially due to the power dynamics or the fact that the boy is a freshman and younger. \n\nThe author made a joke in a group where they usually make fun of each other. The context is important. The group dynamic is one where they're used to joking around, so the author might have thought it was okay. However, the joke was about Ashley's age gap with the 14-year-old. The author was trying to make a jab, similar to previous interactions where they discussed Ashley's insecurity. \n\nThe problem here is that even if it's a joke, the subject matter might be sensitive. Ashley might feel that the age difference is a personal issue, and the group's reaction suggests that they thought the joke crossed a line. The author's comment was direct, pointing out the 14-year-old part, which could be seen as shaming or mocking her relationship. \n\nThe user's perspective is that even if it's legal, it's creepy, and the author isn't in the wrong. But from Ashley's side, being called out in a group for something that's legally acceptable (though maybe socially frowned upon) could be hurtful. The group's reaction indicates that the author's joke was taken as offensive, leading to tension. \n\nAlso, the author used a \"joking tone,\" but the line between humor and offense can be thin. The group's response suggests that the joke wasn't appropriate in this context. Even if the author's intent was to make a lighthearted comment, the impact on Ashley was negative. \n\nSo, considering both the intent and the impact, maybe the author is in the wrong. The joke might have been insensitive, even if it was meant to be funny. Relationships with significant age gaps can be a touchy subject, and making light of it in a group setting where the person is part of the conversation can be hurtful. The fact that Ashley reacted strongly and the group supported her suggests that the author overstepped.\n"
