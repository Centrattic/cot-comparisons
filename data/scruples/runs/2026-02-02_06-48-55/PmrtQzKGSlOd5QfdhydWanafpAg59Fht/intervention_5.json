Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who made a joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old was in the wrong. The situation is a school trip where friends often joke around. The key points here are the legality, context of the joke, and the reaction.\n\nFirst, even though it's legal where they are, a 14-year-old is still quite young. The author made the comment in a joking manner during a group conversation where Ashley was already discussing the relationship. The author's joke was responding to a previous comment that two other girls were insecure, and Ashley agreed. The author extended that to all three, including herself, by pointing out her age difference. \n\nBut even in a joking context, bringing up the age difference might be sensitive. The other girls were upset, and Ashley's reaction was strong. The author might have crossed a line by making a joke about something that could be seen as inappropriate or creepy, even if legal. The others in the group also said it was \"too far,\" which suggests they felt the joke was in poor taste. \n\nHowever, the author claims it was in good fun, and the group later laughed it off. The legality part is a factor, but the social context is important too. Relationships with such a significant age gap can raise ethical concerns regardless of legality. The author's comment might have been seen as pointing out a real issue, but in a way that was hurtful. \n\nSo, while the intent was to joke, the subject matter is sensitive. The line between humor and being offensive can be thin. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they might have overstepped. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The fact that the group chided them and Ashley was angry suggests that in the social context, they did go too far. So, the answer would be A, yes, they were in the wrong.\n"
