Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author was in the wrong for jokingly calling out a classmate for dating someone underage. The situation is that Ashley, an 18-year-old, is dating a 14-year-old, which is legal where they live. The author made a joke about it during a group conversation, which led to Ashley getting angry and flipping them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. Even if it's legal in their area, there's a significant age gap. But the user is in the U.S., so laws vary by state. Some states have close-in-age exemptions, but others don't. Even if it's legal, it can still be seen as inappropriate or creepy by others, especially in a school setting.\n\nNext, the context of the conversation. The author mentions they often joke around and tease each other. The comment was made in a group, and Ashley was already in a conversation about the other girls who had dated the same boy. The author's joke was pointing out that Ashley was also insecure by dating a much younger boy. The problem here might be that even though it's a joke, pointing out someone's dating choice in a group where others are already sensitive could be crossing a line.\n\nAnother angle: the reaction. Ashley was upset, and others in the group said it was \"too far.\" The author thought their joke was in line with their usual teasing, but the subject here might be more sensitive. Joking about someone's personal relationships, especially involving a significant age difference, can be hurtful even if it's meant in good fun.\n\nAlso, societal norms. Even if it's legal, there's a cultural perception of a large age gap in relationships as inappropriate. The author might be reflecting that perception, but doing so in a way that's public and could be seen as shaming.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were just joking and the group usually laughs at each other. However, this particular joke might touch on something more personal and sensitive. Ashley's reaction shows that it did affect her, leading to a conflict. The others also chided the author, indicating that the group found the joke out of bounds.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't mean to attack Ashley, the context and the subject matter (a 4-year age gap when she's 18 and the other is 14) might make the joke in poor taste. The reaction suggests that the group felt it went too far, even if it's legal. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the joke crossed a social line, even if not legally.\n"
