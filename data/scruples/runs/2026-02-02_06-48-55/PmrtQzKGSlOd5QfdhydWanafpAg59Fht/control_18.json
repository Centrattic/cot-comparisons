Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for jokingly calling out an 18-year-old for dating a 14-year-old. The context is a school trip with friends where they often joke around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. The user mentions that in their location, the relationship is legal. So, legally, there's no issue. But the main question is about the social judgment and the reaction from Ashley and others.\n\nThe author made a joke in a group conversation, which Ashley took as a personal attack. The key points here are the tone and context. The author claims it was in a joking manner, part of the usual banter. However, the subject matter is sensitive\u2014there's a significant age gap. Even if it's legal, some people might find it creepy, regardless of gender. \n\nBut the problem here is that the author pointed out Ashley's dating choice, which could be seen as prying or making a judgment about her personal life. Even in a joking context, bringing up someone's age gap in a relationship can be hurtful or offensive, especially if it's a touchy subject for them. The fact that Ashley flipped them off and others said it was \"too far\" suggests that the group felt the joke crossed a boundary.\n\nAnother angle is the intent. The author wasn't trying to attack but to make a jab. However, intent doesn't always override impact. If the joke made Ashley uncomfortable and caused a conflict, even if it was resolved later, the author might have overstepped. \n\nAlso, the comparison to a reversed scenario where it's a 14-year-old girl and older guys is interesting. But that's hypothetical and doesn't excuse the comment. The issue is whether the author's joke was appropriate in the given context.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended to be mean, the subject of the joke (age gap in a relationship) is sensitive. The reaction from Ashley and the group indicates that the joke was offensive, so the author might be in the wrong. The fact that it led to a confrontation, even if it was resolved with laughter, shows that it affected the group dynamic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
