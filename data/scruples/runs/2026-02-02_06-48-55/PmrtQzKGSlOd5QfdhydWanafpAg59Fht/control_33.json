Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who made a joke about their friend dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend, Ashley, is 18 and dating a 14-year-old, which is legal in their state. The author made a joke in a group conversation, which escalated into Ashley being upset and flipping them off. The author is confused because they thought it was a joke, but others said it was too far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. Since it's legal where they live, maybe the author crossed a line by commenting on something that's technically allowed. However, there's a common perception that a 14-year-old is quite young, so the joke might have been based on that perception. The author's friends were already talking about the situation with the two other girls, so the conversation was already in a sensitive area.\n\nThe author's intention was to joke, but the comment specifically targeted Ashley's relationship, which could be seen as personal. Even if it's legal, the age difference is significant, and making a joke about it in a group setting where others are already discussing the drama might have been hurtful. The key here is whether the joke was in good taste and appropriate given the context.\n\nAlso, the reaction from Ashley and others suggests that the joke was unwelcome. While the author might not have intended to attack Ashley, the fact that it led to her flipping them off indicates that it was taken as a personal attack. The author's friends also sided against them, saying it was \"too far,\" which implies that the social norms in their group don't tolerate that kind of joke.\n\nAnother angle is the gender aspect mentioned by the author. They say that if the genders were reversed, people would find it creepy. This might indicate a double standard, but that doesn't justify the joke. The appropriateness of the comment isn't about who is being targeted but whether the comment itself is acceptable.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author made a joke, targeting someone's relationship with a significant age difference in a sensitive context might be crossing a social line. The author's friends and Ashley's reaction suggest that they were in the wrong, despite their intent.\n"
