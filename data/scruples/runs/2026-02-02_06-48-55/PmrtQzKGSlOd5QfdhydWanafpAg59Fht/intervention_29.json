Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who made the joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The scenario is a school trip with friends where they often joke around. The person says they made a joke in a group conversation, pointing out Ashley's relationship with a 14-year-old, which was legal in their location. Ashley got upset, flipped them off, and others said it was \"too far.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user claims it was a joke, part of their usual banter. However, the subject of the joke is Ashley dating a 14-year-old. Even if it's legal, there's a significant age gap. The user might think it's a reasonable jab, but others might see it as crossing a line, especially since Ashley was already sensitive about similar comments regarding other girls. The user's joke could be perceived as insinuating that Ashley is insecure or that her relationship is creepy, which might be hurtful even if intended as a joke.\n\nAlso, the reaction was strong: Ashley got angry, flipped them off, and others chided the user. Even if the group laughed it off later, the immediate reaction suggests that the joke was offensive. The user mentions that it would be different if genders were reversed, implying societal double standards, but that doesn't necessarily justify the joke in this context.\n\nThe key points are the intent versus the impact. The user's intent was to make a joke in a friendly group, but the impact was hurtful. In group dynamic situations, especially where there's prior tension (like with the other girls), certain topics can be more sensitive. Even if the user didn't mean it maliciously, the subject matter might be inappropriate for joking, regardless of legality. So, even if it's legal, the social implications and the hurt caused might make the user at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
