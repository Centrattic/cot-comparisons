Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for joking about Ashley dating a 14-year-old. The situation is a group of friends who often joke around. The key points here are the legal age, the context of the joke, and the reaction from Ashley and others.\n\nFirst, the age difference. Legally, in some places, an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old is legal, but it's still a big age gap. The user mentions that the 14-year-old was previously involved with two older girls, which adds some context about the boy's history.\n\nThe author made a joke in a group conversation where they usually tease each other. The joke was pointing out Ashley's dating choice, implying insecurity. The tone was supposed to be light-hearted, but Ashley took offense and others agreed it was \"too far.\" The user is confused because they think the situation is creepy and the joke would be different if genders were reversed.\n\nNow, considering social norms vs. legality. Even if legal, a 14-year age gap might be seen as inappropriate by many. The author's joke might have been mean-spirited, even if intended as a joke. The problem here is that the subject is a sensitive topic. Making a joke about someone's relationship, especially involving a minor, can be hurtful regardless of the legal aspect. \n\nAlso, in the group dynamic, even if they usually joke, there's a line. The reaction indicates that crossing that line happened here. Ashley's response and others chiding the author suggest that the joke wasn't just a harmless tease but targeted a potentially sensitive issue. The author might not have considered Ashley's feelings or the seriousness of the age gap in the context of their friends.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison to the other girls. The author included Ashley with the other two girls, which could have been perceived as grouping her with them in a negative light, adding insult to injury. Even if it's a joke, the content might have been too personal and hurtful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to make a joke, the subject matter is sensitive and can be seen as crossing a social boundary, leading others to feel it was in poor taste. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the joke was about a potentially creepy situation, regardless of legality, and caused hurt feelings.\n"
