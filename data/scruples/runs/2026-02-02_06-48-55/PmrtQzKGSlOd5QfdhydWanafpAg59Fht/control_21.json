Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who made a joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The situation is that the author made a joke in a group conversation, which led to Ashley getting angry and flipping them off. Now the user is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a school trip with friends, and the group often jokes around. The author's joke was in a joking tone, part of their usual banter. However, the subject matter is Ashley dating someone who's four years younger, which is legal where they live but still might be seen as inappropriate by some.\n\nThe key points here are: the age gap, the legal status, the nature of the joke, and the reaction it caused. Even though it's legal, there's a social stigma around dating someone significantly younger, especially when one is still a minor. The author's intention was to make a jab, not to attack, but the subject is sensitive. The friends' reactions indicate that they felt it crossed a line.\n\nEven if the author meant it as a joke, it's possible that the topic is a sensitive one, especially for Ashley. The fact that Ashley was already involved in drama with other girls might have made her more defensive. The joke could be seen as attacking her relationship, which might not be fair, even if it's legal. The author's comment was a generalization (\"all three are insecure\"), but pointing out Ashley's dating age might have been the trigger.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that if the genders were reversed, people would find it creepy. That suggests that there's a double standard, but that doesn't excuse making a joke about Ashley's relationship. The author might be right that the situation is creepy, but the way they addressed it publicly and mockingly could have been hurtful and disrespectful, even in a joking context.\n\nIn terms of social norms, even in a group that's used to joking, there are limits. The author's comment led to immediate negative reactions, indicating that the group felt it was out of bounds. The author might not have intended harm, but the impact on Ashley was negative. So, even if the author's intention was just to joke, the consequences matter. The author could have chosen a different way to make a joke without targeting Ashley's relationship, especially given the potential for it to be seen as disrespectful.\n\nTherefore, even though the age difference is legal, the joke was likely inconsiderate and crossed the line, making the author at least partially responsible. The answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the joke was hurtful and the context of the relationship (previous drama) made it more sensitive. The author should have considered how their words might affect Ashley and chosen a different approach.\n"
