Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who made a joke about an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. They're asking for a yes or no answer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made a joke in a group of friends who often tease each other. The key points are that Ashley is 18, the boy is 14, and it's legal where they live. The author's comment was meant as a joke, but it upset Ashley and others.\n\nLegal aspect: While it's legal in their state, age-gap relationships can still be sensitive, especially when there's a significant difference. The author's comment might have hit a nerve because of the power dynamics or societal perceptions, even if it's technically allowed.\n\nThe situation also involved previous drama with other girls and the same boy. The author's comment grouped Ashley with the others, implying insecurity, which might have felt like an attack. Even in a joking context, pointing out something that's legally permissible but socially controversial can be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's done in a group where others are present.\n\nSocial norms: Even if the relationship is legal, the age difference might be viewed as inappropriate by others. The author's joke could be perceived as calling out Ashley's choice in a way that others find uncomfortable, even if it's meant as a joke. The fact that Ashley reacted strongly and others agreed it was \"too far\" suggests that the group found it offensive.\n\nIntent vs. impact: The author intended it as a joke, but the impact was negative. The friends and Ashley took it seriously enough to get upset. In group dynamics, especially with close friends, the line between teasing and hurtful comments is thin. The author might not have realized how sensitive the issue is to others.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that if the genders were reversed, people would find it creepy. This highlights a potential double standard, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the comment. The key is whether the comment was appropriate regardless of the hypothetical scenario.\n\nConsidering all factors, even though the relationship is legal and the comment was meant as a joke, the social sensitivity and the negative reaction from the group indicate that the author might be in the wrong. The joke targeted a legally permissible but socially questionable action, which others found offensive. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
