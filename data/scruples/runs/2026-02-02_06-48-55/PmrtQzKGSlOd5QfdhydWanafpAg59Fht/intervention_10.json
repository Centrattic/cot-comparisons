Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they made a joke about their friend Ashley dating a 14-year-old, even though it's legal where they live. The group was already talking about the drama between Ashley and the other two girls who were interested in the same guy. The author chimed in by saying it sounds like all three are insecure, and then Ashley gets upset when the author points out she's dating a 14-year-old.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the context of the conversation, the tone, and the legal status of the relationship. The author mentions that the joke was in a joking tone, like their usual banter. But Ashley and others took offense. Now, even though it's legal in their location, there's a cultural or social norm aspect to consider. People might find an 18-14 relationship creepy regardless of legality. The author's comment was targeted at Ashley's relationship, which could come off as personal, especially since Ashley was already sensitive about the previous drama.\n\nThe author's friends said it was \"too far,\" so there's a group consensus that the joke crossed a line. Even if the author wasn't trying to attack Ashley, the impact of the joke caused her to flip them off and get angry. The flip side is that if the genders were reversed, maybe people would react differently, as the author suggests. But that's a bit of a red herring because the focus should be on the actual relationship dynamics, not hypothetical scenarios.\n\nI think the author did overstep. Even in a group of friends who joke around, there are boundaries. The comment about Ashley's relationship choice might have been more personal than they intended, especially in the context of previous tension. The fact that Ashley's reaction was so negative and the group chided the author suggests that the joke wasn't appropriate. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
