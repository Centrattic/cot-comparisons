Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called out their friend for dating a 14-year-old was in the wrong. The situation is a school trip where friends often joke around.\n\nThe key points are: The author made a joke in a group conversation, pointing out Ashley's age difference with her 14-year-old boyfriend. Ashley got angry, flipped them off, and others said it was \"too far.\" The author thinks it's creepy but believes it's okay if genders were reversed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The joke was in a group where they usually make fun of each other. However, the topic is sensitive. Dating a minor can be legally allowed where they are, but socially, there might be a stigma. The author's comment was meant as a joke, but it targeted Ashley's relationship choice, which could be seen as crossing a line even in a joking manner.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that others got mad, which is a sign that maybe the joke wasn't appropriate. The fact that Ashley reacted strongly and others chided the author suggests that the comment was offensive, even if it was a joke. Even if the author didn't intend to attack, the impact of the comment matters. The joke might have been hurtful or disrespectful, especially considering the age gap and societal views on such relationships.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that it would be different if genders were reversed might be influenced by societal biases, but that doesn't justify the comment. The main issue here is whether the joke was appropriate. In a group where they usually joke, there's a line that shouldn't be crossed. The author's comment targeted Ashley's personal life in a way that others found offensive, so they might be at fault.\n"
