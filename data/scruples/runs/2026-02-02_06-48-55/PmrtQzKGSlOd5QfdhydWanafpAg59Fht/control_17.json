Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making a joke about an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the situation is a school trip with friends who often joke around. The author made a comment in a group conversation where Ashley, 18, was dating a 14-year-old. Legally, in their location, this is allowed. The context is that there was prior drama between Ashley and two other girls over the same boy. The author's joke was in response to Ashley agreeing that the other girls were insecure, so the author extended the joke to include Ashley's situation. The comment was meant to be a lighthearted jab but caused Ashley to react angrily, flipping the author off. The group then moved on, but Ashley was upset initially.\n\nNow, considering the ethics and social norms. Legally, the relationship is permitted, but socially, a 4-year age gap can be seen as inappropriate, especially with a significant maturity difference. The author used humor, which is common in their group, but crossing into sensitive topics like age gaps might be a misstep. Even if the intent was jest, the subject matter touches on something that can be perceived as creepy or disrespectful, regardless of legality. The flip side is that if the genders were reversed, the reaction might be different, implying societal double standards. However, the author's comment specifically targeted Ashley's choice, which could be seen as attacking her judgment. Even in a joking manner, making such a comment can be hurtful and disrespectful, especially when the person being joked about takes offense. The fact that others chided the author suggests that the group felt the line was crossed. The author's defense is that it's a joke among friends, but the context of prior drama might have made it more sensitive. So, while the author might not have intended harm, the comment could still be considered inconsiderate or offensive in that setting. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because the joke was on a sensitive topic and caused immediate offense, even if it was meant to be a joke.\n"
