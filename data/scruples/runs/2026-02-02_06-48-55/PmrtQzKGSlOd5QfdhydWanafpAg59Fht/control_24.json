Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who made a joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The situation is during a school trip with friends, and they often joke around.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person made a joke saying \"it sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\" because Ashley is dating a 14-year-old. Even though Ashley was already in a legal relationship, the comment was taken as an attack. The user claims it was a joke, part of their usual banter. Ashley got really mad, flipped them off, and others sided with her, saying it was \"too far.\"\n\nNow, considering the context. The age difference here is significant. Dating a 14-year-old, even if legal in their area, might be seen as inappropriate or creepy by others, especially if the genders were reversed. However, the user's friends might be uncomfortable with the joke because it's sensitive. Even in a joking context, bringing up such a topic could be hurtful. The user's friends reacted negatively, which suggests that the line was crossed. The user's comment targeted Ashley's choice, which might have been more personal than others in the group were comfortable with, even if it was a joke. Plus, the fact that Ashley was defensive about the two other girls and then the user brought her into the same group could have made her feel attacked. So, even if the user's intention was just to joke, the impact was negative. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for not considering Ashley's feelings and the sensitivity of the topic.\n"
