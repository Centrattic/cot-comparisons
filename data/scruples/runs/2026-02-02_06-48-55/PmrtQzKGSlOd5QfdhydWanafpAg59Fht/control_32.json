Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who made a joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The context is a school trip with friends where they often joke around.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author made a joke saying Ashley and the two other girls were all insecure because they were involved with the same 14-year-old boy. Even though Ashley is 18 and it's legal where they live, the comment was about the age difference. The user argues that the joke was in line with their usual banter, but Ashley and others took offense, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, considering the norms of humor and social dynamics. Friends often have a certain level of teasing, but there are lines. Dating someone significantly younger can be sensitive, even if legal. The humor here might be seen as crossing a line because it touches on a potentially unethical or uncomfortable topic. The author's defense is that it was a joke similar to their usual interactions, but the reaction from the group suggests it wasn't well-received.\n\nAlso, there's a gender angle mentioned\u2014the user points out that if the genders were reversed, people might find it creepy. That highlights a possible double standard. However, the legality isn't the issue here; it's the social acceptability and the way the joke was delivered.\n\nThe main factors are intent vs. impact. The author intended to make a joke, but the impact was negative. In group settings, especially where humor is a regular part of interactions, the line between acceptable teasing and hurtful comments can be blurry. The fact that Ashley flipped off the author and others said it was \"too far\" indicates that the joke affected the group dynamics negatively.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the intent was just a joke, the subject matter and the reaction suggest that the author might have overstepped. The humor targeted a sensitive issue (age gap in a relationship) which can be seen as inappropriate, regardless of legality. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
