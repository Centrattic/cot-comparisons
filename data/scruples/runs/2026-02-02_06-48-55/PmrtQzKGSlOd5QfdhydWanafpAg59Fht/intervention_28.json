Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who made the joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The situation is a school trip with friends where they often joke around. The key points here are the context of the joke, the legal age difference, and the reaction it caused.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Ashley is 18 and dating a 14-year-old, which is legal where they live. However, some people might still find it creepy or inappropriate. The author made a joke by pointing out Ashley's age difference, which led to Ashley getting angry and others chiding the author.\n\nThe main question is whether the joke crossed the line. Even if the group usually makes jokes, this particular topic might be sensitive. Dating someone significantly younger can be a touchy subject, especially if there's a power dynamic or if it's considered inappropriate by some. The author's comment was a jab, but it's possible that Ashley felt targeted, especially since she was already sensitive about the previous drama with the other girls.\n\nAlso, the fact that Ashley turned around and said \"fuck you\" and flipped off the author might indicate that she felt personally attacked. Even if the intention was to joke, the impact on her could be significant. The author might not have considered how Ashley would feel about being publicly called out for her relationship choice, which could be seen as judgmental or hurtful, even in a group that's used to joking.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that it's creepy to date a 14-year-old and that others would react similarly if the genders were reversed. But legality doesn't always equate to social acceptability. Just because it's legal doesn't mean the joke is acceptable. The author might have thought they were making a valid point, but using humor to comment on someone's personal relationships can be tricky and potentially offensive.\n\nConsidering the reactions from Ashley and the group, it seems like the joke wasn't well-received. Even if the author didn't intend to attack, the comment might have been seen as crossing a boundary, especially in a situation where there was already drama involved. The fact that the group said it was \"too far\" suggests that others felt the author overstepped.\n\nSo, weighing the context, the sensitivity of the topic, and the reactions, it's likely that the author is in the wrong here. The joke, while intended as a jab, targeted a personal aspect of Ashley's life that others found offensive, leading to a negative response. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
