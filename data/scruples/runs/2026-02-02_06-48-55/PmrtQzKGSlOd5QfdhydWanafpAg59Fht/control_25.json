Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who made the joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old was wrong. The context is that they're all friends, and they joke around a lot. The author says it was a joke, but Ashley got really upset and flipped them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentions that in their area, the 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old is legal. But even if it's legal, there's a social and ethical angle. The age difference is significant\u2014four years. Some might find it inappropriate regardless of legality.\n\nThen there's the context of the conversation. The author was responding to Ashley complaining about the two other juniors. The author made a joke that included Ashley in the same category. That might have felt like a personal attack, even if it was meant as a joke. When the author called out Ashley's relationship, it could have been perceived as targeting her specifically, especially since the other two were juniors and Ashley is a senior. The joke might have undermined her relationship in front of others, which could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the reaction: Ashley flipped them off and said \"fuck you.\" That's a strong reaction, and the group chided the author, suggesting that crossing a line. Even if the group laughed it off later, the immediate reaction shows that the joke was offensive. Friends might have boundaries about joking about relationships, especially when there's a significant age gap.\n\nAnother point is the gender aspect. The user mentions that if the genders were reversed, people would be incredulous. That could imply a double standard, but the author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in societal norms. However, pointing out a double standard in a joke might not land well if it's not framed correctly. The audience might not appreciate the jab, even if the underlying point has merit.\n\nThe key factors here are intent vs. impact. The author intended it as a joke, but the impact was hurtful. In group dynamics, especially with friends who joke a lot, sometimes the line is crossed when the joke is personal or touches on sensitive topics. Relationships can be a sensitive area, and joking about someone's partner's age, even if legal, can be seen as disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author didn't mean to attack, the joke had a negative impact. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they crossed a social boundary, despite the legal context. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
