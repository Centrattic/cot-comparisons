Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who made the joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The scenario is a school trip with friends who often joke around. The key points are: Ashley is 18, dating a 14-year-old, which is legal where they live. The author made a joke pointing out Ashley's dating choice, which led to Ashley getting angry.\n\nFirst, the author says the comment was made in a joking tone. But the subject is a 14-year-old, which might be a sensitive topic. Even if legal, there's a power imbalance. The author's comment might have crossed into sensitive territory because of the age difference. Friends can make jokes about each other, but when it's about someone dating someone significantly younger, it could touch on societal norms about relationships and age gaps, which might be seen as inappropriate regardless of legality.\n\nAshley's reaction was anger and flipping the author off, but then the group moved on. The others in the group also said the comment was \"too far,\" indicating they felt it was inappropriate. The author argues it's creepy if the genders were reversed, which suggests they might think the standard is different, but that's a double standard. The legal aspect doesn't necessarily make it socially acceptable. Even if it's legal, the social acceptability is a different matter.\n\nThe author's intention was to make a joke, but the content of the joke could be seen as making a personal comment about Ashley's choice, possibly implying judgment. Even in a group of friends, some topics are off-limits, especially when it's about someone's personal life that might carry social stigma. The fact that Ashley was already involved in drama with other girls might have made the situation more charged.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended harm, the comment did cause offense and was seen as going too far by others. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because the joke targeted a sensitive issue and crossed a social boundary, even if it was in a group that otherwise jokes around a lot.\n"
