Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for jokingly calling out an 18-year-old for dating a 14-year-old. The context is a school trip with friends where they often joke around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentioned that in their location, it's legal for an 18-year-old to date a 14-year-old. So legally, there's no issue. But socially, there might be a problem. The age difference is significant, and even if it's legal, some people might find it creepy or inappropriate.\n\nThe person made a joke in a group conversation where they usually tease each other. The joke was about Ashley dating a 14-year-old, which Ashley found offensive. The others also got mad. The key here is whether the joke crossed the line from friendly teasing to something hurtful or inappropriate.\n\nEven though the author intended it as a joke, the subject matter is sensitive. Commenting on someone's relationship, especially with a large age gap, can be hurtful. Even if it's legal, the social perception might be negative. The reaction of Ashley and others suggests that the joke wasn't well-received. The fact that Ashley flipped them off and said \"fuck you\" indicates that she felt attacked, even if it was meant as a joke.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the dynamic would be different if the genders were reversed. That might reflect societal norms and expectations, but that doesn't justify making the joke. The appropriateness of the joke isn't based on hypothetical scenarios but on the context and the feelings of the people involved.\n\nFriendly teasing usually works when both parties are comfortable with the subject matter. In this case, Ashley wasn't comfortable with the joke, so the author's comment went too far. Even if the group usually jokes around, this specific topic might be a line that shouldn't be crossed.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't intend to attack Ashley, the comment was about a sensitive issue and caused hurt feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the joke went beyond what was acceptable in their group, despite the legal aspect.\n"
