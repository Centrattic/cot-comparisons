Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a situation is in the wrong for jokingly calling out Ashley, an 18-year-old, for dating a 14-year-old. The context is a school trip with friends who often joke around. The author made a joke saying that all three girls (Ashley and the two others) were insecure because Ashley dated a 14-year-old after the two juniors had flings with the same boy. Ashley got angry and flipped them off, but the group moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user notes that in their area, it's legal for Ashley to date a 14-year-old. However, legality doesn't always equate to social acceptability. Next, the social and ethical implications. Even if it's legal, there's a significant age difference. The 14-year-old is a minor, and while the relationship is between a 14 and 18-year-old, the power dynamics and maturity levels might be a concern. But the main issue here is the joke itself.\n\nThe author's intention was to make a joke in a group conversation where they usually tease each other. However, the subject of the joke is Ashley's romantic relationship with a much younger boy. Even if done in jest, making fun of someone's relationship where there's a minor involved can be sensitive. The other girls had previous flings with the same boy, but Ashley is the one in the legal relationship now. The joke might imply that Ashley's choice is questionable, which could be seen as invalidating or judgmental, especially in a peer group.\n\nAshley's reaction was strong\u2014she got angry, flipped them off, and left the conversation. The group chided the author for going \"too far,\" which suggests that the peers felt the joke crossed a line. Even if the author thought it was a harmless jab, it's possible that the subject matter is more sensitive than they realized. Relationships involving minors can be a touchy subject, and humor around them might not be appropriate, regardless of legality. The author's comment could unintentionally imply that Ashley's relationship is creepy or inappropriate, even if they meant it as a joke.\n\nThe user also mentions that if the genders were reversed, people would be incredulous. That's a common double standard, but that doesn't justify the joke. The author is using a comparison that might be based on societal norms, but that doesn't make the joke acceptable. The key here is whether the joke was respectful and appropriate in the context. Since it was taken negatively by Ashley and others in the group, the author might have overstepped, even if it was meant to be light-hearted.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author didn't mean to attack, the content of the joke is about a relationship that could be perceived as problematic, and the peers' reactions indicate that it was not well-received. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the joke could be seen as crossing a boundary, regardless of the original intent.\n"
