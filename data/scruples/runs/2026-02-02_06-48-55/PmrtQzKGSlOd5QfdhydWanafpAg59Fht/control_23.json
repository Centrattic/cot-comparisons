Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author made a joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old, which is legal where they live. The group was already talking about the drama between Ashley and the two other girls. The author joined in with a joke, pointing out Ashley's age difference. Then Ashley got mad, flipped them off, but later everyone moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they joke around a lot with each other, so maybe the tone was part of the usual banter. However, the subject here is Ashley dating someone who's four years younger. Even if it's legal, some people might find a significant age gap creepy, especially if the younger person is a freshman and Ashley is a senior. The other girls were also involved in drama with the same boy, so there's some underlying tension.\n\nThe author's comment was a jab during a group conversation. The problem here is that even if it's a joke, the topic is sensitive. People might feel that commenting on someone's relationship, even in a joking manner, can be hurtful. Ashley's reaction was to flip them off, but then the group laughed it off. However, others in the group said the author \"went too far,\" implying that the joke wasn't appropriate.\n\nLegally, the age difference is allowed, but socially, there's a perception that a senior dating a freshman might be seen as inappropriate, especially in a school setting. The author's joke could be seen as reinforcing negative stereotypes or making Ashley feel targeted. Even if the author didn't mean to attack Ashley, the comment was about her relationship, which is a personal matter. Friends often have boundaries about what topics are fair game for jokes. If the group usually makes fun of each other, maybe Ashley felt this crossed a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it was just a joke in a group that's used to humor. The flip side is that even if it's a joke, the subject matter can affect how it's received. The author's comment was directly about Ashley's personal life, which might be more sensitive. The fact that Ashley and others reacted strongly suggests that the joke wasn't well-received, even if it was meant in good spirits.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not have intended to be mean, but the topic is sensitive. The key is whether the joke was in poor taste or crossed a social boundary. Since others in the group felt it was too far, and Ashley reacted negatively, it's possible the author was in the wrong, even if it was a joke. The age gap, even if legal, could be seen as an inappropriate subject for a joke among peers, especially in a school setting. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
