Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the letter is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of friends joking about Ashley, who's 18 and dating a 14-year-old, which is legal in their state. The writer made a joke pointing out the age difference, which led to Ashley getting angry and others saying the writer went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer mentions that the group often jokes around and that the comment was made in a joking tone. However, the key issue here is the age of the person Ashley is dating. Even though it's legal, some might find it creepy, especially given the significant age gap. The writer's comment was a jab at Ashley's insecurity by referencing the age difference. \n\nNow, the question is whether the joke crossed a line. Even in a group that's used to teasing, certain topics might be sensitive. Pointing out someone's romantic partner's age could be more hurtful than a typical joke. The fact that Ashley reacted strongly and others said it was \"too far\" suggests that the comment was offensive. The writer might not have intended harm, but the impact matters. \n\nAlso, the writer mentions that if the genders were reversed, others would find it incredulous. This implies a double standard, but that doesn't justify the comment. The legality doesn't necessarily equate to acceptability. Even if it's legal, the writer's joke might have targeted Ashley's personal choice in a way that's not appropriate, even among friends. \n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's intent was to joke, the subject matter\u2014someone's romantic relationship with a minor\u2014could be seen as crossing a boundary. The reaction of the group and Ashley indicates that the joke wasn't well-received, so the writer might be in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
