Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making a joke about Ashley dating a 14-year-old. The situation is a group of friends who often joke around. The author called out Ashley in a joke, pointing out she's dating someone 4 years younger. Others got mad, and Ashley flipped them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group is friends who make fun of each other a lot. The author's comment was in a joking tone. But the issue here is about a legal age difference. The user mentions that where they live, Ashley dating a 14-year-old is legal. But legal doesn't always mean socially accepted, especially when there's a big age gap. \n\nThe key point is whether the joke crossed a line. Even if it's legal, some people might find a 4-year age gap in high school contexts uncomfortable. The user's comment was \"it sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\" leading to Ashley's reaction. The user then specifically called out Ashley's dating choice as the reason. \n\nNow, even in a joking manner, pointing out someone's dating choice that could be seen as problematic might be hurtful. The friends reacted negatively, saying it was \"too far.\" The author's defense is that it's creepy if reversed. But the problem is that the joke could be seen as targeting Ashley's personal life, which might be sensitive. \n\nAlso, even if the intent was just a joke, the impact matters. Ashley was upset and reacted strongly. The group's response indicates that the joke wasn't well-received. So while the author might not have intended harm, the comment could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nIn terms of social norms, joking about someone's relationship, especially when it involves a significant age difference, can be offensive even if it's legal. The fact that others in the group didn't support the joke suggests the author was in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the joke, despite being in a friendly group, targeted a sensitive personal choice and caused harm, even if unintentionally.\n"
