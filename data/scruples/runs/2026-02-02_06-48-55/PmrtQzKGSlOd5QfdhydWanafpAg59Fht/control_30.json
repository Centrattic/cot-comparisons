Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for jokingly calling out a 18-year-old for dating a 14-year-old. The scenario is a school trip with friends where they usually joke around. The author made a joke about Ashley, who's 18 and dating a 14-year-old, implying that she and the other two girls (the ones who had a fling and tried to date the same boy) are all insecure. Ashley got really mad and flipped the author off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group usually jokes around, so the author thought it was a lighthearted comment. However, the joke was about Ashley's relationship, which is legally allowed where they live. The other girls were also involved in similar situations, so the author tried to include them in the joke to show that it's not just Ashley. But Ashley took it personally, even though the author was trying to be funny.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the effect. The author's intent was to make a joke, not to attack Ashley. However, the effect was that Ashley felt targeted. Even though it's legal, dating someone four years younger might be seen as creepy by some, especially if the power dynamics are considered. The author's comment might have triggered Ashley's insecurity, making her defensive.\n\nNow, considering the responses from others who said it was \"too far,\" but they moved on after some laughter. The question is whether the joke was appropriate. Even if the author intended it as a joke, the subject matter is sensitive. Relationships with significant age gaps can be controversial, and even if legal, the perception can vary. The fact that Ashley reacted so strongly, even if she later relaxed, suggests that the joke crossed a line for her.\n\nAlso, the author included others in the joke (all three girls), but Ashley's reaction was specifically directed at her. Maybe she felt singled out despite the broader context. The group might have felt the author was being too harsh or targeting Ashley more than the others.\n\nIn terms of accountability, it's about whether the joke was respectful. Even in a group that's used to joking, some topics are sensitive. The author might not have realized how personal the comment was for Ashley. So, even if others laughed it off later, the immediate reaction indicates that the author was in the wrong by making a joke that hurt Ashley's feelings, regardless of the legality or the group's usual humor.\n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the joke, while intended as a joke, was about a sensitive topic that made Ashley feel targeted and upset.\n"
