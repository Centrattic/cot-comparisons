Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for jokingly calling out a classmate for dating a 14-year-old. The situation is a school trip with friends where they often make jokes.\n\nFirst, the context: Ashley is 18, dating a 14-year-old, which is legal in their state. There's been drama with other girls also dating the same boy. The author joins the conversation and makes a joke implying Ashley's insecurity by pointing out the age difference. Ashley reacts strongly, gets angry, and others support her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the joke crossed a line. The author claims it was in a joking tone and part of their usual banter. However, the topic of an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old is sensitive, even if legal. It's close to the legal age of consent (which varies by state), and even if legal, people might find the age gap inappropriate. The author's joke could be seen as making light of a potentially creepy situation, which could be offensive regardless of intent.\n\nAlso, considering the group's reaction and Ashley's response, others felt the joke was too harsh. Even if the author didn't mean to attack her, the impact was negative. The key here is that while the author's intention was to make a joke, the subject matter is sensitive, and the audience's reaction matters in determining if it was appropriate.\n\nIn terms of social norms, making jokes about someone's personal relationships, especially with a significant age gap, can be seen as crossing a boundary. So, even if the author isn't in the wrong legally or factually, socially, it's likely they overstepped. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
