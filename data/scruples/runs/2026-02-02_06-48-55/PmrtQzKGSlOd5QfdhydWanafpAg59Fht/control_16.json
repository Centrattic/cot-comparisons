Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who made a joke about an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The context is a school trip with friends where they often joke around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentions that where they live, it's legal for an 18-year-old to date a 14-year-old. But legality doesn't always mean it's socially acceptable. There's a big difference between what's allowed by law and what's considered appropriate in social circles.\n\nThen there's the social dynamics. The girl Ashley was already in a situation where others had previously dated the same boy, leading to drama. The user's comment was a joke pointing out that Ashley is dating a 14-year-old, which might be seen as insensitive, especially if others were already upset about her being critical of the other girls.\n\nEven though it was a joke, the user's comment brought attention to Ashley's relationship in a way that might make her feel embarrassed or judged. The reaction from the group was negative, indicating that the joke was taken as crossing a line. Friends might have different thresholds for what's funny, and in this case, the joke made Ashley feel attacked.\n\nThe user argues that it's creepy and people would react differently if the genders were reversed. However, that's a different scenario. The issue here isn't about the gender roles but the age difference and the social context. Making a joke about someone's relationship can be hurtful regardless of the truth or legality.\n\nAlso, the user's intent was to make a jab, but the impact of the joke caused Ashley to react angrily. Even if the intention was just to joke, the effect on Ashley and the group's disapproval matter. In group settings, maintaining harmony is important, and crossing the line with jokes can disrupt that.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, while the user might not have intended to harm, the joke was inconsiderate and crossed the line for the group. Therefore, the user is in the wrong in this situation.\n"
