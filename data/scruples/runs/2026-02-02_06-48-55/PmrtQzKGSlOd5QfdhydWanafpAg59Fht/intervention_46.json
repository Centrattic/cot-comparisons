Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for jokingly calling out Ashley for dating a 14-year-old. The situation is that the author was in a group conversation where Ashley was complaining about two other girls. The author then made a joke implying that Ashley was also insecure because she dated a 14-year-old. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentioned that in their location, the age of consent might make Ashley's relationship legal. But even if it's legal, there's the social and ethical angle. The user argues that it's creepy, but the author was joking. The key here is the intent and the context of the joke. The group is close and they often joke with each other. However, the comment might touch on sensitive issues like the age gap and potential power dynamics. \n\nEven if it's legal, making a joke about someone's relationship with a minor could be seen as crossing a line, especially if it's about a significant age difference. The reaction from Ashley and others suggests that the joke wasn't well-received. The author's reasoning is that they were just having fun, but the joke might have been hurtful or disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the fact that Ashley was already in a sensitive situation (complaining about others) might have made the joke more pointed and mean-spirited, even if intended as a joke. The flip side is that Ashley's reaction was strong, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. The question is whether the joke was in poor taste or crossed into being an attack.\n\nIn terms of social norms, joking about someone's choice to be in a relationship with a minor, even if legal, can be seen as inappropriate. The author might have overstepped by pointing out Ashley's dating choice in a group setting where she was already defensive. So, even though it was a joke, it could be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they made a potentially harmful comment under the guise of humor, which led to a negative reaction. But this is a judgment call. However, considering the context and the impact, the answer leans towards A.\n"
