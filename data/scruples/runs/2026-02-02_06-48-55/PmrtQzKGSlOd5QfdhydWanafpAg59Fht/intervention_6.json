Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who made a joke about their 18-year-old friend dating a 14-year-old was in the wrong. The situation is that the author made a joke in a group conversation, and while Ashley was dating the 14-year-old before the situation, the author pointed it out, which caused Ashley to get angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the joke was made in a group setting where they often joke around. However, the age difference here is significant\u2014Ashley is 18, the boy is 14. Even though in some places the age of consent might be higher, the age gap is still substantial. The user notes that Ashley had previously been critical of two other girls who had dated the same boy, and the author's comment was a jab pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nThe key points here are whether the joke crossed a line. Jokes are usually protected under free speech, but there's a fine line between playful teasing and something that's hurtful or offensive. The problem is that Ashley found the comment offensive enough to respond with anger and a flip-off. The group also thought the author went too far. The author's reasoning is that it's creepy, and the response might differ if genders were reversed, implying that there's a double standard.\n\nNow, even if the joke was meant to be light-hearted, the subject matter (dating a minor) is sensitive. The legal aspect aside, the social implications are important. The age difference could be seen as exploitative, especially if there's a power dynamic involved. The author's comment, while a joke, might have highlighted something that Ashley found personally sensitive or embarrassing. The group's reaction suggests that they felt the comment was too harsh or inappropriate in that context.\n\nAnother angle is the intent versus the impact. The author intended to make a joke, but the impact was that Ashley felt targeted and upset. Even if the group laughed it off afterward, the immediate reaction was negative. In social dynamics, it's important to consider how others might feel, not just the intent. The author's comment, even as a joke, might have touched on a sensitive issue that others found offensive.\n\nMoreover, the comparison to reverse gender scenarios is a red herring because the age of consent and societal perceptions can differ based on gender, but the core issue is the appropriateness of the joke. The fact that Ashley was previously critical of others for dating the same boy adds context that the author was pointing out a contradiction, which might have been the trigger.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent was to make a joke, the subject matter is sensitive and could be seen as crossing a line. The reaction from Ashley and the group indicates that the joke was indeed too far, making the author the one at fault. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
