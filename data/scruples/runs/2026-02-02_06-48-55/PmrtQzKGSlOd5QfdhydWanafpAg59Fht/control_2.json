Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who made the joke is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author was on a school trip with friends, and they were joking around. One of the girls, Ashley, is 18 and dating a 14-year-old, which is legal where they live. The author made a joke pointing out Ashley's relationship, which led to Ashley flipping them off and getting angry. The author thinks it's creepy and that others would be shocked if the genders were reversed. They want to know if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group was making jokes and roasting each other, so the author thought it was a lighthearted jab. But Ashley took offense, got angry, and others said it was \"too far.\" The key points here are the legal age difference, the dynamic of the group, and whether the joke crossed a line.\n\nEven though the relationship is legal, there's a significant age gap. The 14-year-old is a freshman, which is much younger, and there's a power imbalance because Ashley is older and in a higher grade. The author's comment was about Ashley dating the 14-year-old, pointing out that all three girls (Ashley and the two juniors) were insecure. The author might have thought it was a joke, but Ashley found it offensive. \n\nNow, considering social norms and perceptions, a 14-year-old is a minor, and relationships with adults can be seen as inappropriate even if legal. The author's joke might have highlighted that age difference, which could be sensitive. Even in a group that's used to joking, there might be a line when it comes to personal relationships. \n\nThe other factor is the response. Ashley's anger and flipping off the author shows that the joke hit a nerve. Others in the group also said it was \"too far,\" indicating that the group's usual banter has limits. The author might have underestimated how sensitive the subject was. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that if the genders were reversed, it would be creepy. This suggests that the author sees the relationship as problematic, but chose to express it as a joke. However, the joke might have come off as mocking Ashley's personal life, which can be hurtful even if intended as a joke. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author needs to consider that jokes about someone's personal relationships, especially with minors, can be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if it's legal, the perception in the group might be different. The fact that Ashley was upset and the others supported her implies that the author overstepped, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because the joke targeted a sensitive and potentially inappropriate relationship, even if it's legal, and it caused harm to Ashley. The group's reaction also supports that the joke went too far.\n"
