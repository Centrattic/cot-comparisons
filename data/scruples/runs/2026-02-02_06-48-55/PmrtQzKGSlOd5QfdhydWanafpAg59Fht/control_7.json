Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who made a joke about an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The situation is in a group of friends where they usually joke around a lot. The key points here are the legal age difference, the context of the joke, and the reactions from the group.\n\nFirst, the age difference: In many places, the age of consent varies. If it's legal where they live, then technically Ashley isn't breaking the law. However, there's a social aspect to consider. Even if legal, a four-year gap might be seen as significant, especially when the younger person is a freshman and the older a senior. The user brings up that if the genders were reversed, people might find it more creepy. That suggests a societal bias, but that doesn't make the joke acceptable if it's offensive to someone involved.\n\nNext, the context of the conversation. The user says it was a joke, part of their usual banter. But the topic is sensitive. Making a joke about someone's relationship, especially when it's a significant age gap, can be hurtful even if intended as a joke. The fact that Ashley reacted strongly, flipping them off and saying \"fuck you\" shows she found it offensive. The rest of the group also said it was \"too far,\" indicating they thought the joke crossed a line.\n\nThe user's intention was to make a jab, similar to how they usually do. However, the subject matter here is more personal and potentially sensitive. Even in a group that's used to joking, certain topics might be off-limits. The user's comment directly pointed out Ashley's choice in a relationship, which is a personal matter. The other girls had prior drama, so maybe the user was trying to compare them all, but that might have come off as unfair or targeting Ashley specifically.\n\nAlso, the legality doesn't erase the emotional impact. Even if it's legal, the joke might have made Ashley feel belittled or judged. The user's friends intervened, which suggests that the group felt the joke wasn't appropriate in that context. The user's argument that it's creepy and others would be incredulous if reversed is a bit of a double standard argument, but that doesn't justify making the joke if it harms someone.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user might not have intended to be malicious, the joke hit a sensitive topic and was offensive to Ashley. The social context and the reaction of the group indicate that the user did cross a line, even if it was a joke. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
