Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong here. The scenario involves a group of students on a school trip, and the person made a joke about their friend Ashley dating a 14-year-old, even though it's legal where they live. The person claims it was just a joke, part of their usual banter, but Ashley got really upset and flipped them off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The age difference is 4 years. In some places, that's legal, but it's still a sensitive topic. The person made a joke pointing out Ashley's relationship in a group setting. The group reacted negatively, with Ashley getting angry. The author is asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether joking about a legal but potentially controversial relationship is acceptable, especially in a group where people are used to teasing each other. Even if the joke was meant to be light-hearted, the subject matter\u2014dating someone significantly younger\u2014can be seen as sensitive or offensive, regardless of legality. The fact that the joke was directed at Ashley in a context where she was already involved in some drama might have made it more hurtful. \n\nEven in a group that's used to joking around, there are lines that shouldn't be crossed. The age gap could be perceived as taking advantage, and the joke might have touched on that, even if the poster didn't mean it to. The reaction of Ashley and the group suggests that they felt the joke was inappropriate. \n\nAlso, the poster's reasoning that it would be different if the genders were reversed is a bit problematic. It's not about gender but about the power dynamic and the appropriateness of the relationship. However, the perception of creepiness might be influenced by societal norms, but the key here is the social context of the joke. \n\nSo, even though the intentions were light, the topic is sensitive, and the joke crossed a line for the group. The author might not have meant harm, but the impact is what matters here. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because the joke, while intended as a joke, was offensive to someone and caused a negative reaction in the group. The fact that the group chided them and Ashley was upset indicates that the social boundaries were breached."
