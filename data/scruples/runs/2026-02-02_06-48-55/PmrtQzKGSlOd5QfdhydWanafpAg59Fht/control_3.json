Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for jokingly calling out a friend who's dating a 14-year-old. The situation is at a school trip with friends who often joke around. The key points are: the guy is 14, Ashley is 18, and it's legal where they live. The author made a joke in a group conversation, and Ashley got angry.\n\nFirst, the author's comment was meant as a joke. But the issue here is that the age difference is significant. Even if it's legal, the social implications might be a concern. The author's friends might feel uncomfortable because of the power dynamics between an older and younger person, especially when the younger is a freshman and Ashley is a senior. The author points out that if the genders were reversed, people would be more shocked, implying a double standard. \n\nHowever, the problem is that the joke targeted Ashley directly, which might have crossed a line. Even in a joking group, some topics are sensitive. Mentioning someone's relationship choices, especially involving a minor, could be hurtful. Ashley's reaction was anger and flipping them off, indicating the joke was offensive to her. The group then chided the author, saying it was \"too far,\" suggesting that the friends think the author overstepped.\n\nThe author argues that the relationship is creepy, but since it's legal, maybe they're not considering the local laws. However, the social aspect\u2014how it's perceived by peers\u2014is important here. The friends might not think it's legal or they might have personal issues with the age gap. The author's comment could be seen as public shaming, even if intended as a joke. \n\nIn group dynamics, even if everyone jokes, there's a line. The author's comment led to an immediate negative reaction from Ashley and the group. The fact that the group moved on after doesn't negate that the author's joke was offensive in the moment. So, even though the author didn't mean to attack, the line about the age difference was inappropriate in that context. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the joke was hurtful and crossed a social boundary, even if it was meant in jest.\n"
