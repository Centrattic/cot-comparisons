Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who made a joke about an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The situation is that they were on a school trip with friends, and there's a history of drama involving Ashley and two other girls. The user made a joke pointing out Ashley's relationship with the 14-year-old, which Ashley took offense to, leading to tension. The user argues it's a joke and that the relationship is creepy, even though it's legal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're friends who joke around a lot, so the user might think it's part of their usual banter. However, the subject here is Ashley's relationship with a minor, which is a sensitive topic. Even if it's legal, the age gap is significant. But the user's comment was a joke, but maybe it crossed a line.\n\nAshley's reaction was strong\u2014she flipped them off and said \"go fuck you,\" which suggests the comment hit a nerve. The user's friends also said it was \"too far,\" indicating that even among their peers, the joke wasn't well-received. The user might not have intended to hurt, but the topic is a sensitive one. \n\nThe key points are: the joke was about Ashley's relationship with a 14-year-old, which could be seen as inappropriate regardless of legality. Even in a group that's used to joking, certain topics might be off-limits. The user's comment could be perceived as attacking Ashley's character or relationship, leading to her backlash. \n\nAlso, the user mentions that if the genders were reversed, people would be more incredulous. This points to a possible double standard, but that doesn't necessarily justify the joke. The main issue is whether the joke was respectful and appropriate. Even if it's a joke, comments about someone's relationship with a minor can be considered in poor taste, especially when the minor is significantly younger. \n\nConsidering all this, even though the user's intention was to joke, the content of the joke targeted a sensitive aspect of Ashley's life. The friends' reactions suggest that the joke wasn't appropriate for the situation. Therefore, the user might have overstepped, even if it was a joke. So, the answer would be that the user is in the wrong.\n"
