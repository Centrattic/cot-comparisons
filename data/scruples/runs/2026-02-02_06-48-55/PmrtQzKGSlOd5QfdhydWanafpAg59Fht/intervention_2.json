Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author was wrong for jokingly calling out an 18-year-old for dating a 14-year-old. The situation is a school trip with friends who often joke around. The key points here are the legal status of the relationship and the context of the joke.\n\nFirst, in the location mentioned, a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old dating is legal. So, technically, there's no law being broken. However, the age difference is significant. Even if legal, it's a 4-year gap, which some might find unusual or concerning, especially in a school setting where peers are closer in age.\n\nThe author made a joke in a group conversation where others were already discussing the situation. The initial comments were about insecurity, and the author added a jab by pointing out Ashley's age difference. The tone was supposed to be humorous, but Ashley took offense, and others agreed it was \"too far.\"\n\nThe author argues that the relationship feels creepy and that if the genders were reversed, people would be shocked. This brings up potential double standards. However, the legality here is important. Mocking someone for a legal relationship could be seen as crossing a line, even if it's a joke. The group's reaction suggests that the joke was hurtful, leading to Ashley flipping them off. Even if the author's intent was just to joke, the impact on Ashley was negative.\n\nThe context of the group's dynamic where they often joke around is a factor, but there's a difference between friendly teasing and targeting someone's personal life in a way that could be perceived as judgmental. The author's comment singled out Ashley's choice, which others might view as sensitive or personal. Even if the group usually has a banter-heavy environment, the specific content of the joke might not align with acceptable teasing. The author's justification based on double standards doesn't negate the fact that they made a personal comment that caused distress.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be cruel, the joke focused on a legal but potentially sensitive topic, leading to a negative reaction. The key here is that even if the relationship is legal, the author's comment was a personal jab that others found offensive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how the joke would be received, despite the legal context.\n"
