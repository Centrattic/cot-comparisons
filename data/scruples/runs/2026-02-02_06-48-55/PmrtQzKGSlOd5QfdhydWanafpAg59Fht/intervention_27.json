Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author was in the wrong for jokingly calling out an 18-year-old for dating a 14-year-old. The context is a group of friends on a school trip where they often joke around.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: In the place where they live, it's legal for an 18-year-old to date a 14-year-old. So legally, there's no issue there. But the user is concerned about the social implications.\n\nThe situation involves Ashley, who's 18, dating a 14-year-old. Before this, two other girls (16 and 17) were also involved with the same boy. The author made a joke implying that all three girls are insecure because of their relationships with the underage boy. The friends reacted negatively, Ashley was upset, and the group turned on the author.\n\nNow, the key points here: The joke was made in a group conversation, and the tone was supposed to be light-hearted. However, the subject is sensitive because the age difference is significant, even if legal. While the author didn't mean to attack Ashley directly, the comment could be seen as targeting her relationship in a way that's uncomfortable. Relationships with such a large age gap can be viewed as inappropriate or creepy by many people, even if they're legal. The fact that Ashley was defensive and others were upset suggests that the joke crossed a line.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that if the genders were reversed, people would be incredulous adds another layer. This implies a double standard, but that doesn't justify the comment. The author's intent was to make a joke, but the impact was negative. In group settings, especially with friends, the line between humor and offense can be thin. The group's reaction indicates that the joke wasn't well-received, even if it was meant to be a light-hearted jab.\n\nConsidering that the author's comment focused on Ashley's relationship in a way that could be perceived as mocking her for dating someone significantly younger, even if legal, it's possible that the author's joke was in poor taste. The friends' reactions and Ashley's anger suggest that the joke went too far, even if the intention wasn't malicious. The author might not have realized the sensitivity of the topic, but the impact is what matters here.\n\nSo, even though the author didn't mean to attack, the comment targeted Ashley's personal life in a way that upset the group. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because the joke was inappropriate and hurtful, despite the intention.\n"
