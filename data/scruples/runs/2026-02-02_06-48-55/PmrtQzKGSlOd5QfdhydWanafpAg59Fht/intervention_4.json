Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for joking about Ashley dating a 14-year-old. The context is a school trip with friends who joke around a lot.\n\nFirst, the author made a joke saying all three girls are insecure because Ashley dated a 14-year-old after two juniors were involved. Even though the 14-year age is legal where they are, the author pointed out Ashley's relationship in a joke. The group dynamic was that they usually make fun of each other, but this time Ashley got really upset, flipped the author off, and others chided the author. The author thinks it's creepy and believes the genders being reversed would make a difference.\n\nNow, considering the legality, in some places, an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old might be legal, but there's still a significant age gap. The issue here is the social context. The author's joke targeted Ashley's relationship, which might have crossed a line even if it was in a joking tone. The reaction shows that Ashley felt it was personal and offensive. Even if the group usually jokes, there's a line where a joke can be perceived as hurtful or inappropriate. The author's comment might have touched on sensitive topics like the boy's age difference and the previous drama between the girls. So, even if intended as a joke, the context and the reaction suggest the author might have overstepped. The author could be in the wrong because the joke was about a sensitive subject and caused a negative reaction, even if it was meant in good humor.\n"
