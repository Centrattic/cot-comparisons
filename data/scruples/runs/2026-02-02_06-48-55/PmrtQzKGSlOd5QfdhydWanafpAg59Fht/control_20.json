Everyone got mad at me.\nThis happened like two hours ago, and although it\u2019s not really a big deal I am curious if I was the one in the wrong in this situation.\n\nI\u2019m currently on a school trip with several classmates. We\u2019re relatively good friends and we make fun of eachother a ton (luckily for the most part everyone can dish and take).\n\nOne of the girls, Ashley, is a senior and 18. She is currently dating a 14 year old freshman (note- where we live this is legal)\n\nBefore she started dating the freshman, there was a lot of drama because two other girls (both juniors and 16/17) also tried to date this boy. He had a fling with one of the juniors and then started dating Ashley seriously.\n\nAshley was complaining about the two girls and someone basically said \u201cit just sounds like they\u2019re both really insecure\u201d and she agreed with them (neither of them were being friendly about it- they viewed it as a negative thing).\n\nI chimed in (this was a group convo) \u201cit sounds like all 3 of you are insecure\u201d. And Ashley goes \u201cWhat? What did I do?\u201d And I replied \u201cdate a 14 year old.\u201d \n\nNOTE: all of this was said in a pretty joking tone, I wasn\u2019t actively trying to attack her just get a jab in like we always do. \n\nShe got really angry and turned around and went silent while everyone chided me and said it was \u201ctoo far\u201d. Then she turned around and flipped me off and went fuck you. And then clarified \u201cthat was just for *insert my name here*\u201d\n\nWe then all kinda laughed to break the tension and now everyone\u2019s moved on. (After she said fuck you to me the topic got changed and she\u2019s no longer upset)\n\nBut I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong, it\u2019s creepy to date a 14 year old boy and everyone would be incredulous if the genders were reversed.\n\nAITA for making that joke?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who made a joke about an 18-year-old dating a 14-year-old is in the wrong. The situation is a school trip where friends often joke around. The person is part of a group conversation where Ashley, who's 18, is dating a 14-year-old. Before that, there was drama with other girls also interested in the boy.\n\nThe user made a joke saying that Ashley and the other two girls are all insecure because they're involved with the same boy, and then specifically pointed out Ashley's age difference. The response was negative, with Ashley flipping them off and others saying it was too far. Now they're confused if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In their location, it's legal for an 18-year-old and a 14-year-old. But the user is questioning the ethics. The key points are whether the joke was appropriate in a group setting where they usually joke. The user claims it was a joke, but the subject is sensitive. Even if it's legal, there might be a perception of impropriety, especially with a significant age gap. \n\nThe user's friends, including Ashley, took offense. The user's comment was a jab in a conversation that was already tense (due to prior drama). Even if it's legal, some people might find the age difference creepy, and the user's joke could have crossed the line by mocking Ashley's relationship in front of others. Also, the group dynamic here is that they make fun of each other, but this might have been too personal or sensitive. \n\nSo, the user's intention was to be humorous, but the impact was negative. Ashley's reaction and others' chiding suggest that the joke wasn't well-received. Even if the user didn't mean to attack, the comment was hurtful. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for making a joke about a sensitive topic in a context where it led to conflict.\n"
