Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. So, the situation is in a dorm with limited dryers. The author saw all dryers were taken, with lots of wet clothes around. They took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, removed it after 40 minutes when it was dry, then left a note. The other person was upset because she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nHmm. First, dorm laundry rules. Usually, there are guidelines, but maybe they don't explicitly say not to take others' clothes. The dryers are a shared resource. If someone is using a dryer for a long time with only one item, that's probably inefficient. The author might have felt justified in stopping the waste. But taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of trust. Even if the clothes were almost dry, removing them could damage the dryer for the owner. Also, the blazer needed to be wrinkle-free, so interrupting that could have affected her interview. \n\nBut the author's intention was to free up the dryer. The result was that others' piles of clothes were processed. However, the method was taking someone else's stuff without asking. Even if it was for a good reason, it's an invasion of privacy. The note from the other person seems to express frustration about being interrupted. \n\nOn the other hand, the dryers were all in use, and the system is inefficient. Maybe there's a better way, like asking if they're done or checking in. But the author didn't do that. They just took the clothes. So, while the intention was to help, the action was unauthorized. So, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they took someone else's property without consent. Even if the dryer was underutilized, it's not their place to decide. The other person had a right to use the dryer as they saw fit unless there were specific rules against it.\n"
