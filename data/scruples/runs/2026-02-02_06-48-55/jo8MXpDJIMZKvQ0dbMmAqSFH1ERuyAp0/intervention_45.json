Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The scenario is that there are limited dryers (6 washers, 4 dryers), and when the author came back, they found a girl's clothes in a dryer set for 75 minutes. They took their own clothes out, but then noticed her clothes and took them out too. The girl was upset because she was using the dryer for her blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules or norms in a dorm setting. Typically, dryers are shared, and people are expected to use them appropriately. If someone is using a dryer for only one item for an extended time, that's probably not fair to others. The author mentions that there were \"mounds of other people's wet clothes\" around, implying that others were waiting. The author took the initiative to remove the clothes when they saw the dryer wasn't being used efficiently. But the key point is whether taking someone else's clothes is acceptable.\n\nThe girl left a note saying not to take others' clothes out of an on dryer. So, there's an implied rule here. Even if the dryer isn't being used properly, taking someone else's clothes might be seen as interfering. However, the author's intention was to free up the dryer for others. The jacket was already pretty dry, so maybe the girl was being selfish by using a dryer for one item for 75 minutes. But the act of removing someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of trust or rules.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they shouldn't have taken the clothes out. Even if the dryer was underutilized, the appropriate action might have been to wait their turn or talk to the person using the dryer. Taking it upon oneself to remove someone else's belongings could lead to conflicts. However, the dorm's limited resources and the girl's misuse of the dryer could justify the author's actions as a necessary evil to prevent others from waiting longer. \n\nBut the note the girl left was a direct accusation, which suggests she felt violated. The author might have overstepped by removing her clothes without asking. Even if the dryer wasn't being used efficiently, the solution should involve communication, not taking matters into one's own hands. So, while the author's intention was to help, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
