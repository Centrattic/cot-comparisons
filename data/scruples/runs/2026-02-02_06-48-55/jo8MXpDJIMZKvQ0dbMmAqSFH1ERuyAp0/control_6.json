Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they took someone else's clothes out of a dryer when all the dryers were occupied. They explain that they saw all the dryers were taken, with a lot of wet clothes around, so they took one item from a dryer that had been running for 75 minutes. The item was already dry, so they hung it up. Later, the owner left a note angry about it, saying she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is whether taking someone else's clothes from the dryer is right or wrong. Generally, people have the right to their own property, so taking someone else's items without permission is a no-go. Even if the dryers were all in use, removing someone else's clothes could cause issues. The woman might have needed that specific item for an interview, so the timing was important. The author might have disrupted her plans, even if the clothes were already dry.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is that the dryers were all full, and there were a lot of wet clothes piling up. They might have felt it was necessary to free up a dryer to avoid a backlog. But the problem is that they didn't check if the clothes were theirs, just took someone else's. Maybe they could have asked, but the story says they just took it.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't know it wasn't their clothes. But that's not a valid excuse. If you're in a shared space, you should check the labels or tags on the clothes before taking them out. Assuming it's yours without confirmation is risky and could lead to conflicts.\n\nAlso, the note from the other person was clearly upset. Even if the clothes were dry, she might have wanted them to finish the cycle for a reason (like the blazer needing more time for the fabric or heat setting). The author's action, while maybe trying to help the situation, was a breach of trust and respect for others' belongings.\n\nSo, even though the dryers were all in use, the correct approach would have been to wait, maybe suggest to others to check their clothes or share the dryers more efficiently, rather than taking someone else's clothes. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
