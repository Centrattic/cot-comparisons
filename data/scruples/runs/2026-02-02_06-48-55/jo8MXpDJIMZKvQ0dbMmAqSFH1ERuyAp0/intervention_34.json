Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about taking someone else's clothes from the dryer.\n\nSo, the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author left their laundry in the washer, then noticed all dryers were full. There were piles of wet clothes around. The author took a single item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, which was already relatively dry. The person left a note angry about it, saying they were using it to dry a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. If there's a rule that you can't take others' clothes from the dryer, then the author is definitely in the wrong. But if there's no such rule, maybe it's a judgment call. The author might have thought they were being helpful by freeing up a dryer to allow others (including themselves) to use it. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally considered wrong because it's their property.\n\nEven if the dryer was only set for 75 minutes and the clothes were mostly dry, the fact that someone else was using the dryer for their own clothes means that the author took something that wasn't theirs. The author might have had good intentions, but without checking or asking, it's an invasion of privacy and ownership. The other person's note was probably justified because they were using the dryer for a specific purpose, and the author disrupted that.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the dryer was on, so taking clothes from an active dryer could be seen as interfering with someone else's process. Even if the clothes were dry, taking them without permission is a breach of trust and respect. The dorm's limited resources might mean that people have to wait, but that doesn't justify taking others' items. The author could have waited, or maybe communicated with the person to see if they could share the dryer, but instead took matters into their own hands. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
