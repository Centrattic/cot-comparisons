Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. So, the situation is that there are limited dryers in the dorm\u20146 washers and 4 dryers. The author found all dryers occupied, with a lot of wet clothes around. They took a girl's clothes out of the dryer because it was already dry, hung it up, and then she got mad. She left a note about not taking others' clothes from a running dryer, especially since she was using it for an interview blazer.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: Did the author have a right to take someone else's clothes without permission? The dryers were all in use, and the author was facing a problem. But the dryer was set for 75 minutes, and the author took it out after 40 minutes. The clothes were already pretty dry. The author mentions that after taking the clothes out, the surrounding piles of wet clothes disappeared, implying that others might have followed suit.\n\nSo, legally, the author didn't own the clothes, so taking them without permission is probably a no-go. But ethically, maybe there's some consideration. The author had a reason\u2014they were stuck with the dryers all full. But they made an assumption that it was okay because it was already dry. However, the owner of the clothes might not have wanted them taken out early, maybe the drying cycle is important for their fabric or because they needed it for an interview. The author didn't check, didn't ask, just took them. Even if the dryer was underutilized, the act of taking someone else's clothes without consent is a problem. The note from the girl is pretty direct\u2014she's upset because they interrupted her drying process. \n\nThe author argues that they helped by freeing up the dryer, but that doesn't necessarily justify taking someone else's clothes. Maybe there's a better way, like waiting or talking to the person. The author's reasoning that they would have left it if they knew is a classic \"if only I knew\" defense. But you can't assume you have permission just because you think you're helping. The other person's belongings should be respected. \n\nSo, ethically, the author is likely in the wrong. Even though the situation was inconvenient, taking clothes without asking is a breach of trust and respect. The answer would be A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
