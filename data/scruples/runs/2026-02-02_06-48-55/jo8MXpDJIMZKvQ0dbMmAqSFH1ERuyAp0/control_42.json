Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is that there were more washers than dryers, leading to a crowded laundry room. The person took clothes from a dryer that another girl was using, which made her angry. The note from the girl says she was drying a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and norms around shared laundry facilities. In dorms, it's common to have shared machines, and there's usually an unspoken agreement to check for tags or wait for your own clothes. The person in question didn't mention if there was a tag indicating ownership. If there was no tag, maybe they assumed it was someone else's, but that's a risky assumption.\n\nThe person took the clothes because all dryers were full, and they wanted to free up a dryer. However, taking someone else's items, even if they're in a shared space, is generally considered wrong because it's respecting others' property. The other girl was using the dryer for a specific purpose\u2014drying a blazer for an interview\u2014which is a valid reason to be upset. Even if her dryer time was set to 75 minutes, interrupting that could affect her plans.\n\nThe argument for the person not being in the wrong is that the dryer wasn't being used efficiently (only one item), and they were trying to help by freeing up a machine. But the main point is ownership. Without permission, taking someone else's belongings is a breach of trust and respect. Even if the clothes were dry, the act of taking them without asking is the issue here. The person could have waited or tried to talk to the owner instead of taking it themselves. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards Yes (A), the author is in the wrong because they took someone else's clothes without permission, regardless of the reasoning. Even if the dryer wasn't being used for multiple items, it's still about respecting others' belongings.\n"
