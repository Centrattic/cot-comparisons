Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by taking someone else's clothes from the dryer. The situation is in a college dorm with limited dryers. The author noticed all dryers were taken, other people's clothes were piling up, and this girl had one item in a dryer set for 75 minutes. The author took her clothes out after 75 minutes because they were dry and hung them up. The girl left a note angry about it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action was right or wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, taking someone's clothes without permission is a violation of their property. Even if the dryers are a shared resource, each person's items are their own. The girl was using the dryer for her blazer for an interview, which is important. The author's action disrupted her plan, even if the clothes were dry. The note the girl wrote seems to be a clear expression of her frustration, so there's an expectation of respect for others' belongings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that the dryers were all taken, leading to a backlog. They might have felt they were helping by freeing up a dryer. If the clothes were already dry, maybe it's not too harmful. But the key issue here is consent. The author didn't ask the girl if she was okay with them taking her clothes. Even if the intention was good, acting without permission is a breach of trust and respect. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is that they wanted to prevent the dryer from being underused. But the girl had set it for 75 minutes, so she likely expected to leave it that long. The author's action might have been seen as overstepping, especially in a shared space where everyone is supposed to respect each other's items. \n\nThe note says \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER.\" That's a direct accusation that the author did something wrong. In a dormitory setting, shared appliances come with unspoken rules about respecting others' loads. Even if the dryers are in short supply, the proper action would be to wait or use another method, not to take someone else's clothes. \n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, the act of taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of etiquette and respect for others' property. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
