Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that there were only four dryers and six washers in their college dorm. The author noticed all the dryers were taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. They took a single item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, and when they came back 40 minutes later, the girl was mad because she was using the dryer for her blazer interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules or norms in a shared laundry area. Usually, people are expected to use the dryers for their own clothes, but if someone is using a dryer with only one item, that's inefficient. The author saw that the dryer wasn't being used efficiently and took action. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally not okay. Even if the dryer was underused, the clothes belong to someone else, so removing them without consent is a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the dorm has a limited number of dryers, and the author might have felt the need to optimize their use. The girl had her dryer set for 75 minutes, but maybe she didn't need it to be that long. If the item was already dry, removing it could save time and energy. But the problem is that the author didn't ask the girl first. They just took her clothes without permission, which is the key issue here. Even if the intention was good, taking someone else's belongings without consent is a problem.\n\nAlso, the note the girl left seems a bit harsh, but her clothes were taken without her knowledge. The author could have approached her politely to ask if it was okay to remove the item, especially since it was already dry. Since they didn't, the author is at fault. The dorm's resources are shared, but respecting others' belongings is still important. So even though the dryers are a shared resource, the clothes in them are personal property. The author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, was unauthorized and thus wrong.\n"
