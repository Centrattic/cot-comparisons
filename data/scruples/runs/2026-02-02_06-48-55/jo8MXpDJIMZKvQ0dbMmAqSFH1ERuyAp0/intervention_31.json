Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that there were more washers than dryers in the dorm, and all dryers were occupied. The author noticed other people's wet clothes around, implying they weren't being taken promptly. The girl in question had her jacket in a dryer for 75 minutes, which the author took out after 40 minutes because it was already dry. The girl left a note upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author took someone else's clothes without permission. Even if the dryer was being underutilized (only one item), the jacket was the girl's property. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to free up the dryer for others, but that doesn't justify taking someone else's belongings without consent. \n\nHowever, there might be some context about the dryer situation. If all dryers are full, and people are leaving their clothes in for long periods, maybe there's a shared problem of inefficiency. But the author's action of removing the jacket without asking could be seen as violating the owner's rights. The girl was using the dryer for a specific purpose (preparing for an interview), so maybe she needed the jacket to be fully dried. \n\nBut the author argues that the jacket was already dry and that freeing up the dryer helped others. However, the act of taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of intent. Even if the motive was to help others, the means were intrusive. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the dorm's rules allow such actions if machines are overused. But unless there's a clear policy permitting it, taking someone else's items is a breach of trust and respect. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the other person's needs and acted unilaterally. \n\nSo, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. Even though the situation is frustrating, the right approach would be to communicate and coordinate with others to share the dryers efficiently, rather than taking their clothes out.\n"
