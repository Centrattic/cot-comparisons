Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. So the scenario is that there are more washers than dryers in their dorm\u20146 washers, 4 dryers. The author was doing laundry, found all dryers occupied, and noticed other people's wet clothes around. They took someone's clothes out of the dryer early because it was already dry. Then the girl was upset because she was using it for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules or norms of shared laundry facilities. Typically, you're supposed to leave clothes in the dryer until they're done unless there's an agreement. But in this case, the dryer was set for 75 minutes, and the author took it out after 40 when it was already dry. The person left a note, implying that taking clothes out early is rude or wrong.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the dryer was underutilized (only one item), and removing it helped others' clothes from piling up. But the other person was using it for an important purpose\u2014preparing for an interview. So there's a conflict between communal resource use and individual needs.\n\nOn one hand, the author intervened to free up a dryer, which might be seen as helpful, especially if others were waiting. On the other hand, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of trust. Even if the item was dry, the dryer time might be necessary for other items in the same load, or the person might have wanted to dry more items. The author didn't ask, so it's an assumption they made.\n\nAlso, the note says \"don't take others' clothes out of a running dryer,\" which is a common rule in shared spaces. So maybe the author broke an unspoken rule. Even if the dryer was underused, the act of removing someone else's clothes could be seen as inconsiderate. The person might have needed the full cycle for the jacket to be properly dry, especially for an interview. The author's action might have inconvenienced someone else for the benefit of others. \n\nSo the question is whether the author's action was justified. If the dryer was only doing one item, maybe it's inefficient, but in a shared space, respecting others' belongings is important. The author could have waited another 35 minutes instead of taking the clothes. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes without permission, even if their intention was good.\n"
