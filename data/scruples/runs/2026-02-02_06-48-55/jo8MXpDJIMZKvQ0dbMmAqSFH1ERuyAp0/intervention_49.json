Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The dorm has a limited number of dryers, and when they went to do laundry, all dryers were occupied. They noticed someone's clothes in the dryer that had been running for 75 minutes, which is a long time. The clothes were mostly dry, so they took them out to hang them up. The other person left a note upset that they interrupted their drying for a job interview blazer.\n\nFirst, the main issue is taking someone else's clothes without permission. Even if there's a shortage of dryers, removing another's items without asking is a boundary violation. The person might argue they were helping by freeing up the dryer, but that doesn't justify taking someone else's belongings. There could have been other steps, like waiting or talking to the person first. The fact that the dryer was being used inefficiently (only one item for 75 minutes) might add context, but it doesn't excuse taking the clothes without consent. The other person was clearly upset, and the author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, was inconsiderate. So, I think the author is at fault here.\n"
