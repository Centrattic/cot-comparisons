Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about taking someone else's clothes from a dryer in a dorm with limited dryers.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author noticed all dryers were taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. They took one item from a dryer, which was set for 75 minutes, and it was already pretty dry. They hung it up, then later got a note from the girl who was using that dryer, upset because she was drying a blazer for an interview.\n\nThe author's defense is that the dryer was being held up, and by taking the item, they freed up the dryer, which then allowed other clothes to be dried. They also mention that the jacket was already dry and okay. But the other person was clearly upset.\n\nSo, the key points here: Is taking someone else's clothes from a dryer without permission wrong? In most situations, using shared appliances, you're supposed to respect others' cycles. Even if the dryer was only set for 75 minutes, taking someone's clothes out without asking could be seen as interfering. The fact that the author did it to free up the dryer might be a mitigating factor, but it's still an act of taking without permission. \n\nThe note from the other person indicates that she needed the dryer for an important purpose. While the author might have had good intentions, they didn't consider the other person's need. Even if the clothes were mostly dry, the owner might have wanted them to be completely dry or properly set. Also, in a shared space, there might be unspoken rules about not taking others' items, even if they seem to be misusing the dryer.\n\nOn the other hand, the dorm has more washers than dryers, so maybe there's a systemic issue. But that doesn't excuse the individual action. The author could have tried to communicate with the person using the dryer, maybe ask if they could take the item early, but instead took it without asking. That's a breach of trust and respect.\n\nSo, even though there's some understandable frustration, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of etiquette and possibly dorm rules. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, which would be answer A.\n"
