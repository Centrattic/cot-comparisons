Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. \n\nSo the setup is that there are 6 washers and 4 dryers in the dorm. The author found all dryers occupied, with lots of wet clothes around. They noticed a dryer that had been running for 75 minutes, took the clothes out (a jacket) because it was already dry, hung it up. Then the owner left a note angry about it. The author argues that by taking the clothes out, they helped reduce the pile of wet clothes, and the jacket was dry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. In a shared laundry area, is it acceptable to take someone else's clothes? Generally, no. Even if the dryer is overfilled, taking someone else's items without permission is a violation of their property. The fact that the dryer was taking too long doesn't justify taking someone else's clothes. However, the jacket was already dry, so maybe the author thought they were doing a good deed by freeing up the dryer.\n\nBut the key point here is consent. The author didn't ask the owner if they could take the clothes. Even in a shared space, people have a right to their belongings. The owner was using the dryer for an important purpose (an interview), which adds weight to their frustration. The author's action might have saved time for others, but it's still an invasion of the owner's property without consent.\n\nAlso, the number of dryers versus washers is a factor. The author mentions there's a shortage of dryers, which could explain the frustration. However, that doesn't excuse taking someone else's items. The proper approach would be to wait until the dryer is available or communicate with others to find a solution, not to take matters into their own hands.\n\nAnother angle: the author took the clothes out when they were already dry. The owner's note says they were \"de-wrinkling a blazer,\" which might take longer. The author might have thought they were helping by removing the clothes early. But the owner's intention was to have it dry for a specific time, so interrupting that process could have ruined the blazer's appearance or the de-wrinkling effect. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author acted without permission, which is a breach of trust in a shared space. Even if the clothes were dry, the act of taking them without asking is wrong. The owner has the right to control their belongings. The author's justification of freeing up the dryer doesn't outweigh the violation of personal property.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. They should have waited or communicated rather than taking the clothes without permission. The fact that the dryer was overused doesn't justify the action. Respecting others' property is more important than the convenience gained.\n"
