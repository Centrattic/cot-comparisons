Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is in a college dorm with limited dryers, and the author took an item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes. The dryer was left with just one item, which the author took because all dryers were occupied, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. The other person was upset because she was using the dryer for a blazer for a job interview. The author claims they only took one item and that the jacket was already dry. The note from the other person says not to take others' clothes from an on dryer.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author took someone else's clothes without permission, even though they had a reason (dryers were occupied). The other person's item was in a dryer that wasn't being used for multiple items, but the author took it to free up the dryer. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, taking someone else's clothes without their knowledge or consent is generally considered wrong. Even if the author had a reason, like the dryers being full, that doesn't necessarily justify taking another person's belongings. The other person had a legitimate right to use the dryer for their own clothes, and the author's intervention disrupted that. The author could have waited for a dryer to become available instead of taking someone else's item. The fact that the jacket was already dry might mitigate some of the harm, but it doesn't excuse the act of taking it without permission. Additionally, the note from the other person indicates that she was particularly stressed about the blazer for an interview, which adds to the frustration. The author's action, while perhaps understanding the dryers being busy, was still a breach of trust and respect for others' property. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
