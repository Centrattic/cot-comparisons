Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is in a college dorm with limited dryers. The author found all dryers occupied, noticed a lot of wet clothes, took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, and after 40 minutes, took it out. The other person left a note upset about it, especially since she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, the key points here: limited resources (4 dryers for a lot of people), the author took action to free up a dryer, which led to the other person's clothes being removed. The author argues that the dryer was underutilized (only one item) and that the clothes were mostly dry. The other person was clearly upset, not just about the clothes but possibly the timing for an important event.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. Is taking someone's clothes without permission acceptable even if the intention was to help free up a resource? In a shared space, there's an unspoken rule to respect others' belongings. Even if the dryer was underused, removing someone else's clothes without asking could be seen as a violation of their property. The author didn't check if the clothes were dry enough for the owner or ask first. The fact that the person left a note shows she felt her belongings were taken without consent, which is a breach of trust and respect.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to alleviate a problem (dryer scarcity). But intent doesn't always absolve action. The right to use shared resources doesn't extend to taking others' items. The author could have perhaps communicated with the dryer's user or waited, but instead took matters into their own hands. The blazer situation might have added urgency for the other person, making the author's action more impactful on her.\n\nSo, even if the dryer was underused, the act of taking someone else's clothes without permission is a mistake. The author should have found another way to handle the situation, like waiting or talking to the person. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
