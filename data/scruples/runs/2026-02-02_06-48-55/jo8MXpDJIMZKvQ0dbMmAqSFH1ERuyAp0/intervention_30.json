Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. So the situation is, they were in a college dorm with limited dryers. All four dryers were taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. The person took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes. They took it out after 40 minutes because it was already pretty dry, which helped clear up the dryer situation. The other girl left a note being upset because she was using the dryer for her blazer.\n\nHmm. The first thing to consider is whether there's an unspoken rule about not taking others' clothes from the dryer. I mean, generally, you don't take someone's laundry without permission. But in this case, the dryers were all taken, and the person felt they had no choice. They thought they were helping by freeing up a dryer. However, the other person was clearly affected because she was using it for an important blazer.\n\nSo, is it fair to say the author was in the wrong? On one hand, taking someone's clothes without asking is a no-go. On the other, the dryers were a shared resource, and the person was trying to manage the situation. But the problem is that the dryer time wasn't up yet. The blazer needed the full 75 minutes. Even if the item was dry, maybe the blazer wasn't, and the author took it out anyway. So, the author didn't check if the dryer was being abused or if there was a way to wait. Also, the note was a bit passive-aggressive, but the person still had a right to be upset.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have waited longer or communicated before taking the item. Since the dryers were shared, maybe there's a system or a way to prioritize. But the author acted without knowing the situation, which led to conflict. Even if the dryers were all taken, taking someone else's clothes, even temporarily, might not be the solution. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the other person's dryer use. But then again, the system is flawed with more washers than dryers, leading to congestion. The author's action did help others, but it caused a problem for one person. So it's a bit of a dilemma. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they took someone's clothes without consent, even if the system is broken. It's about respecting others' belongings, even in shared spaces.\n"
