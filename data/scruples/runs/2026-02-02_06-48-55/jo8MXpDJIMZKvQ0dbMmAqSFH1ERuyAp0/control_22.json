Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that there are limited dryers in the dorm\u20146 washers, 4 dryers. The author went to do laundry, found all dryers taken. Other people's wet clothes were everywhere. The author took one item from someone else's dryer because it was already pretty dry and hung it up. Then the other person left a note angry about it, saying not to take clothes from a running dryer.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about shared resources and respect for others' belongings. The author's reasoning is that by taking the one item (a jacket), they helped free up a dryer for others, since there were piles of clothes waiting. But the other person was using the dryer for a blazer needed for an interview, which might be a time-sensitive situation.\n\nFirst, is it ever okay to take someone else's clothes from a dryer? Generally, people own their belongings, even in shared spaces. So taking someone else's clothes without permission is probably a no-go. Even if the dryer was taking longer than necessary, the author didn't have the right to interfere. Maybe they could have waited their turn or asked if the person wanted to share the dryer, but taking clothes without asking is a breach of trust and respect.\n\nThe author mentions the jacket was \"already pretty dry,\" but that doesn't justify taking it. The other person might have wanted it to finish drying, especially if it was a blazer. Plus, the note was hot and sarcastic, indicating the author was inconsiderate. However, the author also points out that others were misusing the dryers by leaving clothes to dry too long. But that's an excuse, not a justification. The right thing would be to address the misuse through proper channels, not by taking someone else's clothes.\n\nIn shared living situations, it's important to follow the rules and respect others' possessions. Even if the system is flawed (few dryers), interfering with others' belongings isn't the solution. The author's action, while maybe well-intentioned to help others, was unauthorized and disrespectful. So the answer is likely Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
