Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking someone else's clothes out of a dryer without permission. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to analyze it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that there are six washers but only four dryers in the dorm. When he went to do laundry, all dryers were taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. He noticed a jacket in a dryer that had been set for 75 minutes, which was already mostly dry. So he took the jacket out and hung it up, which made the girl angry. She wrote a note explaining she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview and was upset that he took her clothes out.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author took someone else's clothes out of a dryer that was running. Even though the dryer was set for 75 minutes, the jacket was already dry, so maybe it was safe to take out. But did he have the right to do that? The dryer is a shared resource, and even if others left their clothes in the dryers, taking someone else's clothes out without asking could be seen as interfering. The author's reasoning was to free up the dryer for others, but the girl was using it for a specific purpose (an interview), which might add urgency.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to solve the problem of limited dryers and the pile-up of wet clothes. On the other hand, taking someone's clothes out without their consent is a direct violation of their property. Even if the clothes were dry, the girl had the right to use the dryer, and removing her clothes without asking was a breach of trust. There might be dorm rules against such actions, even in shared spaces. The author's action, while maybe well-intentioned, was an overstep. The fact that the girl left a note shows her frustration and that she felt her belongings were being mishandled. \n\nSo, even though the author's intent was to help others, the action was still wrong because it involved taking someone else's clothes without permission. There might be better ways to address the dryer issue, like asking if someone is done or waiting longer, but taking clothes out is a privacy and property issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
