Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is that there were only 4 dryers in a college dorm with 6 washers. The author noticed all dryers were taken, with lots of wet clothes around. They took a single item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, which was already dry, and hung it up. Then they got a note from the owner saying not to do that. The author argues that their action helped free up the dryer, as the clothes around started to disappear after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and social norms. Taking someone else's clothes from a dryer without permission is generally considered wrong because it's another person's property. Even if the dryer was in high demand, removing someone else's belongings without consent is a breach of trust. However, there's a mitigating factor here: the dryer was underused (only one item in a 75-minute cycle), and the author might have thought they were helping by freeing up the dryer faster. \n\nBut does that justify taking someone else's clothes? The owner was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, which is important. The author didn't check with the owner before taking the item, which is a key point. Even if the clothes were dry, the act of taking them without permission is a violation. The argument that it helped others might not override the personal violation of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the dorm's infrastructure (more washers than dryers) likely creates a bottleneck. The author's action might have been a response to a systemic problem. However, the correct approach would be to wait or find another solution rather than taking someone else's belongings. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author is in the wrong because they took someone else's property without consent, even if their intention was to help. Social norms and respect for others' belongings are more important than the convenience gained. So the answer is A.\n"
