Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author is doing laundry, finds all dryers occupied, and there's a lot of wet clothes around. A girl has one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. The author takes it out because it's already dry, hangs it up. Then the girl leaves a note angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules or norms in a shared laundry setting. Usually, when you put clothes in a dryer, you're expected to not take others' clothes out without permission. Even if the dryer is full, taking someone else's item could be seen as interfering with their process. The girl was using a dryer for a blazer for an interview, which is important. The author might have thought they were helping by freeing up a dryer, but the act of removing someone else's clothes without consent is a problem.\n\nAlso, the note says she was \"dewrinkling\" the blazer, which might mean she needed the heat to set the clothes or reduce wrinkles. Taking it out early could have ruined her efforts, making her late for the interview. The author might not have known, but ignorance isn't an excuse for taking someone else's property. Even if the item was dry, the ownership is clear. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to solve a problem with limited resources. The dryers were all in use, and others' clothes were piling up. Maybe the girl wasn't efficient by using a dryer for 75 minutes on one item. But that doesn't justify taking someone else's clothes. The right approach would have been to ask first or wait, not to take without permission. \n\nSo, overall, the author acted without consent, which is a key issue here. Even if the intention was good, the action was wrong because it invaded someone else's property and could have caused them harm (ruined blazer for an interview). Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
