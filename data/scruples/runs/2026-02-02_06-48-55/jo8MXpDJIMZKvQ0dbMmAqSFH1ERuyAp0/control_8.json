Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. They were in a college dorm with limited dryers. All dryers were full, so they took a clothes that were already somewhat dry. The other person was using one dryer for a long time and left a note about it.\n\nFirst, the user's reasoning: They saw all dryers taken and others had piles of wet clothes. They took one that was already dry. They claim this action helped others' clothes get dried faster. But the other person was using the dryer a long time and was upset because she needed the dryer for her blazer.\n\nBut wait, even if the dryer was in use, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a boundary issue. The user might not have known whose clothes they were, but once they took them, that's a problem. Also, the fact that the dryer was \"on\" means it's in use. Removing clothes from a dryer that's still running isn't just a matter of using a resource efficiently; it's interfering with someone else's property.\n\nThe note the other person left is pretty clear about the rule. The user's argument is that they were trying to help by reducing the wait for others, but taking someone else's clothes without asking is still taking. Even if the clothes were dry, it's about respecting others' belongings. There's no mention of asking permission or checking if the clothes were theirs. So, ethically, the user is in the wrong because they took someone else's property without consent. The fact that their action might have had a good intention doesn't negate the violation of the other person's rights.\n\nSo the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
