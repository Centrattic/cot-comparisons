Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" thread is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was doing laundry in a dorm with limited dryers. They noticed all dryers were in use, and other people's wet clothes were around. The author found a dryer that had one item with a 75-minute cycle. They took that item out after 40 minutes because it was dry, hung it up, and then later found a note from the owner who was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were trying to free up a dryer, and the clothes were already dry. But the note from the other person was clearly upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nHmm. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a privacy and ownership issue. Even if the dryer was in short supply, removing someone else's items could be seen as disrespectful. The owner might have had a specific reason for drying the item longer, like needing it to be completely dry for an interview. The author might not have considered that, even if the item seemed dry.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to solve a problem (dryer shortage) and the clothes were already dry. Maybe it was a good intention, but the method was wrong. The key point here is consent. Without knowing whose clothes they were, removing them could be seen as an invasion of others' property. Even if the author thought they were helping, acting without permission can lead to conflicts.\n\nAlso, the note the author left was confrontational (\"HOT TIP...\"), which is passive-aggressive. That probably made the situation worse. But the main issue is whether taking the clothes was wrong. The author didn't communicate with the owner, just took the item. So even with good intentions, the action was unauthorized.\n\nIn most situations, taking someone else's belongings without asking, even temporarily, is not acceptable. The consequences here were that the owner was upset, and the author's solution might have caused more problems. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't get permission and acted on their own judgment, which could have risked the owner's needs.\n"
