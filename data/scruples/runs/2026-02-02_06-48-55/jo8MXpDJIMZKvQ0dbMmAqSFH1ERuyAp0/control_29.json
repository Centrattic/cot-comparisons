Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's think through this. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author noticed all dryers were taken and there were piles of wet clothes. The girl had a single item in a dryer set for 75 minutes. The author took it out after 40 minutes when it was relatively dry, hung it up, then left a note. The girl was upset because she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? Well, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally not acceptable. Even if there was a problem with limited dryers, removing someone else's item could be seen as interfering with their property. However, the author might argue that they were trying to free up a dryer for others, as there were piles of clothes waiting. But the key point is that the author didn't ask the girl first. Assuming she wouldn't mind might be a mistake. The girl's note was harsh, but the author's action was a trespass on her belongings. On the other hand, maybe the author was trying to be helpful. However, the standard is usually that you shouldn't take someone else's items without consent, regardless of the reason. So, even if the intention was good, the action was wrong. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
