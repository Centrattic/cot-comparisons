Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is from a college dorm with limited dryers. The author saw all dryers were taken, there were piles of wet clothes around implying people were taking up space without using them. They took one person's item that was set for 75 minutes, which was already dry, and hung it. The girl left a note about not taking others' clothes out of a running dryer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the laundry room. If there's no explicit rule against taking someone else's clothes, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But usually, using someone else's clothes without permission could be an issue, even if the intent was good. The author mentions that the dryers were all taken, which might mean people were holding them for no reason. However, taking someone else's clothes could be seen as a violation of their rights, even if the dryer was underutilized.\n\nThe author's action might be justified because the dryer wasn't being used efficiently. The girl was using a dryer for a long time, and the author tried to free it up. But the problem is that the clothes were technically hers. The author didn't own them, so removing them could be considered theft or interference. However, the author might argue that the system isn't working as intended, and they were trying to help the overall process.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. The author's action might have prevented the girl from having her blazer properly dried for her interview. However, the blazer was already in the dryer for 75 minutes, and the author took it out after 40 minutes. If it was already dry, maybe the damage wasn't too bad. But the girl's frustration is understandable because her clothes were being taken from a dryer mid-cycle.\n\nThe key factors here are intent, rules, and consequences. The author's intent was to free up a dryer, which is a common problem in laundry rooms. However, without permission, taking someone else's clothes is a gray area. If the dorm has a policy against it, then the author is in the wrong. If not, maybe it's a situational judgment call.\n\nIn many dorms, it's considered bad etiquette to take others' clothes, even if the dryer is being wasted. People might be in the process of drying, and taking their clothes without asking could lead to conflicts. The author might not be in the wrong if the dryer was being misused, but the act itself is still a breach of trust or rules.\n\nSo, considering that, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the author took someone else's clothes without permission. Even if the dryers were underused, the action could be seen as meddling. However, if the dorm's system allows such actions to prevent hoarding, then B (not in the wrong) could be valid. But generally, taking someone's belongings without consent is a breach, so A seems more likely.\n"
