Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes.

LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The scenario is that there are only four dryers in a college dorm with six washers. The author found all dryers occupied, so they took a random girl's clothes (specifically a blazer) that had been in the dryer for 75 minutes, which the girl had set. The author took the clothes out after 40 minutes because they were relatively dry, hung them up, and later the girl left a note upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dorm's policies. If there's a rule against removing others' clothes from the dryer, the author violated it. But if there's no such rule, maybe it's a judgment call. The author's reasoning was that the dryers were all full, and they were trying to free up a dryer by taking out clothes that were already dry. However, the girl needed the blazer for an interview, and taking it out early might have ruined it or delayed her.\n\nMoral responsibility: The author didn't own the clothes but decided to take them without permission. Even if the clothes were dry, taking someone else's belongings without asking could be considered inconsiderate. The girl had a specific need for the blazer, so the author's action might have caused her stress. But on the other hand, the author was trying to solve a problem caused by others (the piles of wet clothes) and maybe thought they were helping.\n\nLegal perspective: Unless the dorm's rules explicitly prohibit this, it's not a legal issue. But ethically, taking someone else's property without consent is generally frowned upon. The author's action was a breach of trust and possibly a violation of the dorm's implicit social contract to respect others' belongings.\n\nPossible defenses: The author might argue that they were trying to manage the limited resources (dryers) efficiently. However, the proper approach would have been to wait or communicate with the dryer's user before taking action. The note left by the girl was harsh, but the author's action was also inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to help free up a dryer, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of trust and consideration. The girl's reaction is understandable given the context of her needing the blazer for an interview. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
