Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they took someone else's clothes out of a dryer that was still running. All the dryers were taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. The author had one item in a dryer, which was set for 75 minutes, but when they came back after 40 minutes, the clothes were mostly dry, so they took them out and hung them up. Then the other person left a note angry about it, saying it was her jacket for a job interview.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the rules of using shared laundry facilities. Usually, in dorms or shared spaces, there are guidelines to follow. Taking someone else's clothes without their permission might be against those rules. Even if the dryer was full, that doesn't necessarily justify taking someone else's items. The author could have left a note for the person to take their clothes, but instead, they just took them themselves. \n\nThe other person was clearly upset because her blazer was in the dryer for a specific purpose\u2014preparing for an important job interview. The blazer might need to be properly dried to avoid wrinkles or to maintain its appearance. The author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned to free up a dryer, could have disrupted that process. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the jacket was \"already pretty dry and looked fine.\" But even if it was mostly dry, it's still not their clothes, and they didn't ask. The fact that the dryer was in use by someone else's clothes means that removing them without consent is a breach of trust and etiquette. \n\nThere's a mention of others leaving wet clothes around, which might imply that the author is frustrated with the same issue. However, that doesn't excuse taking someone else's clothes. The right approach would be to address the problem through proper channels, like talking to the dorm administration or following the established rules for laundry, rather than taking matters into their own hands. \n\nSo considering all that, even if the intention was to free up the dryer, the action was wrong because it involved taking someone else's property without permission. The author didn't own the clothes in the dryer and didn't consult the owner. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
