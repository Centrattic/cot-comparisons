Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that there are only 4 dryers in a dorm with 6 washers. They found all dryers taken, with many piles of wet clothes. They took a single item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes but had already been drying for 40. The other person was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview and left a note.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership and intent. The author didn't own the clothes they took out. Taking someone else's belongings without permission is generally wrong. Even if the dryer was overloaded, removing another's clothes could disrupt their process. The blazer might need the full cycle to dry properly, especially for an important interview. However, the author's motivation was to free up a dryer, which is understandable given the scarcity.\n\nBut the key point is consent. Did the author ask if they could take the item? Probably not. Even if the dryer was being misused (like having only one item in it), it's not the author's place to take someone else's clothes. The owner has a right to use the dryer as they see fit, even if it's inefficient. The author's action, while maybe well-intentioned, was an invasion of the other person's property. The note from the other person indicates they were upset, which supports that the author caused harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the system is broken (more washers than dryers) leading to inefficiency. But that's a systemic issue, not a justification for taking someone else's property. The right answer here is that the author did wrong by taking the clothes without permission. So the answer should be A.\n"
