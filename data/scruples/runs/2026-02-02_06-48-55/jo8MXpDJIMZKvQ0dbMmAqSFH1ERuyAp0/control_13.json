Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that there were only 4 dryers in a dorm with 6 washers. The author found all dryers taken, and there were piles of wet clothes around. They took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, which was already relatively dry, and hung it up. Then the owner left a note angry about it, mentioning a blazer for a job interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and norms. Generally, taking someone else's laundry without permission is a no-no. Even if the dryer was overfilled, removing someone's clothes without asking could be seen as trespassing on their property. The author might argue that they were trying to free up a dryer, but that doesn't negate the fact that they took someone else's belongings. \n\nHowever, there's context here. The dryers were all occupied, and there was a lot of wet clothes, implying maybe inefficiency. The author's item was already mostly dry, so maybe they thought it was safe to remove. The other person was using a dryer for an important purpose, which adds weight to their frustration. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, the author didn't have permission. Even if the dryer was misused (like one item in a dryer for 75 minutes), the right approach would be to ask politely or maybe talk to the owner. The act of taking without permission is the issue here. The author might not have intended harm, but the action itself is wrong because it's respecting others' property. \n\nAlso, the note the other person left was direct but the author's action was impolite. So even if there was a good reason to free up a dryer, taking someone else's clothes without asking is a breach of trust and respect. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
