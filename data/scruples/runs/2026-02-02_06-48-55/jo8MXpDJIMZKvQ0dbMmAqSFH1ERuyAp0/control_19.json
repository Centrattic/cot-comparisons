Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where the dorm has a limited number of dryers, and the writer had to take action because all were full.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. If there are specific policies about using dryers, that's a factor. The user didn't mention any rules, so I might assume there's no explicit rule against it. But even without rules, there's a social contract aspect. Taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally frowned upon, even if the intention was to help. \n\nThe writer mentions that the dryer was running for 75 minutes and the clothes were already dry. They took one item out, which could be seen as a minor act. However, the person whose clothes it was left a note, indicating they were upset. The writer's justification is that they were trying to free up the dryer for others, which is a valid point when resources are limited. \n\nBut intent versus impact matters here. Even if the writer's intention was good, the act of taking someone else's clothes without asking can be seen as intrusive. The other person was using the dryer for a specific purpose (drying a blazer for an interview), so timing might be important. The writer didn't know the context, but the action still disrupted the other person's plans. \n\nAnother angle: in shared spaces, people usually expect their items to remain untouched. The writer might not be in the wrong if the clothes were dry and the dryer was underutilized, but taking someone's clothes could lead to conflicts. The fact that the other person left a note shows that they felt their rights were violated. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the writer could have asked the person if they could take the clothes or waited a bit longer. Instead, they assumed they had the right to take action. So while the situation is understandable given the limited dryers, the action itself was a breach of trust or respect. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the writer being in the wrong (A) because taking someone's belongings, even with good intentions, is a violation of personal property. However, there's a mitigating factor because they were trying to help. But the main issue is the act itself, not the intent. So probably AITA is on the writer.\n"
