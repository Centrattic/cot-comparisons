Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. So, the situation is that there are 6 washers and 4 dryers in the dorm. The author found all dryers occupied, with lots of wet clothes around, implying others aren't using them efficiently. The guy took out his clothes, noticed one item in a dryer that was almost dry (set for 75 minutes but only 40 minutes in), took it out, and hung it up. The girl left a note angry about it, saying she was using the dryer for an interview blazer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dorm's dryer situation is limited, and the author is trying to manage the resources. The girl had one item in the dryer for 75 minutes, which seems excessive. If the author noticed that the dryer was underutilized (since she only had one item), maybe it was reasonable to take it out. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a privacy and trust issue. Even if the clothes were dry, removing them without asking could be seen as an invasion of privacy or interference with their property.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he was trying to free up the dryer for others. However, he didn't ask the girl if he could take her clothes. The fact that her item was already dry might mitigate some blame, but the act itself was without consent. The girl had a valid reason (job interview) to use the dryer, and the author's action disrupted her. Even if the clothes were dry, taking them could have caused her stress, especially if she needed the blazer to be properly dried.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have known the item was hers. But in a shared space, it's expected that you respect others' belongings. The note from the girl indicates she was upset because her blazer was being dewrinkled, which might require the dryer's heat beyond just drying. So, removing it could have affected her ability to prepare for the interview.\n\nSo, the key points are: limited resources, the author's intention to help, but without consent. The action was unauthorized, which is a problem. Even if the clothes were dry, the author should have checked with the owner before taking them. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
