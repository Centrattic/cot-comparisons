Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is a bit of a dilemma.\n\nFirst, the dorm has more washers than dryers, so there's a scarcity. The author noticed all dryers were taken and there were piles of wet clothes around. They took a jacket that was in a dryer, set for 75 minutes, but it was already dry. They took it out, hung it up, then left a note from the girl saying she was using the dryer for her blazer interview. \n\nSo the main points here: Did the author have a right to take the clothes? The dryer was being occupied by someone else, and maybe the author was trying to free up the dryer. But taking someone else's clothes is a violation of their property. However, the dryer was on for 75 minutes, and the jacket was already dry. The girl was using the dryer inefficiently, keeping it for longer than needed. The author's action might have saved others from waiting, but taking clothes without permission is still a breach of trust.\n\nBut then again, the author didn't know whose clothes they were. They just saw a dryer that wasn't being used efficiently. However, the responsibility is on the dryer user to manage their time and not leave it for too long. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to help the situation. But taking someone else's belongings without consent is still a problem. \n\nThe girl was upset because she needed the dryer for her interview. The author's action might have affected her preparation. But the author might not have known that. It's a balance between communal responsibility and individual rights. In a shared space, everyone has a responsibility to use resources efficiently. If someone is using a dryer for much longer than necessary, others might step in to prevent a monopoly on resources. However, taking clothes without permission is a red line. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be entirely at fault because they were trying to resolve a common issue. But the act of taking someone else's clothes is still an issue. Maybe a middle ground: the author was in a tough spot, but the right thing would have been to talk to the person using the dryer or leave a note instead of taking the clothes. Since they did take it without permission, there's some fault. But the context of the dryer not being used efficiently and the scarcity of dryers complicates things. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because taking someone else's clothes without asking is a violation. Even if there was a good reason, the proper approach would have been to communicate first. The girl's note was a bit harsh, but the author's action was still unauthorized. So the author is at fault.\n"
