Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person took someone else's clothes from the dryer. They mention that there were only 4 dryers and 6 washers, which probably means dryers are a limited resource. They found all dryers taken and there were piles of wet clothes around. They took a jacket that was in a dryer, set for 75 minutes, but it was already relatively dry. They took it out, hung it up, and then the girl left a note.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. If the dorm has rules about not taking others' clothes from the dryer, then they're in the wrong. But if there are no explicit rules, it's more about common courtesy. The person's reasoning was to free up a dryer because there were a lot of wet clothes around. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if the jacket was mostly dry, the act of removing it without asking could be seen as interfering with someone else's property. The girl was using the dryer for her blazer, which she needed for an interview, which adds context that it was important to her. The person might have thought they were helping, but it's still a violation of trust and personal space. So, even if their intention was good, the action itself is problematic. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
