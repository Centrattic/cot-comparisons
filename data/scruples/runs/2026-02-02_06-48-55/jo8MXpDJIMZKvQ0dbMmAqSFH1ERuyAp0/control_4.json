Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is in a college dorm with limited dryers. The person took a random girl's clothes because all dryers were full, and they thought they were helping by freeing up a dryer. The girl got mad because her blazer was left in the dryer for 75 minutes, and she was using the dryer for a job interview.\n\nSo, first, the main issue is whether taking someone else's clothes without permission is wrong. Even if the dryers were full, taking someone else's items could be seen as an invasion of privacy and a breach of trust. The author didn't ask the owner before removing the clothes. The note from the girl indicates that she was in a hurry, and the author's action disrupted her process.\n\nAlso, the dorm's resources are shared, and each person is supposed to follow the rules. If the dryers are full, the right approach might be to wait or ask others if they can move their clothes. The author's assumption that they could take someone else's clothes for the greater good might not be justified. Even if the blazer was already dry, removing it without permission could be considered inconsiderate. People might have specific reasons for how they want their clothes dried, like the blazer example for a job interview. \n\nOn the other hand, the dorm has a problem with available dryers, and the author was trying to help by freeing up a machine. But that's not an excuse to take someone else's property without consent. The key point here is consent. Without knowing whose clothes they were, the author's action was a risk. Even if the dryers were busy, the right thing would be to wait or check with the owner. The fact that the girl was upset about it suggests that it's a significant issue. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author probably is in the wrong because taking someone's belongings without permission is a problem, regardless of the intention. The solution should have been to wait or find another way to manage the laundry situation without interfering with others' items.\n"
