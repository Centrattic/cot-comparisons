Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they took someone else's clothes out of the dryer when all the dryers were full. The person left a note mad about it, saying they were using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules or norms in a dorm setting. Usually, shared laundry facilities have some kind of system, maybe like putting a towel or sign on the machine. But if there's no specific rule mentioned here, maybe the general expectation is that if you're using a machine, you should do so responsibly. The author mentions that all dryers were taken, and there were piles of wet clothes around, implying that people were taking up dryers with just one item. That seems inefficient. The author took out the one item when it was relatively dry to free up the dryer. \n\nBut then again, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a bit of a breach of privacy and trust. Even if the dryer was underutilized, the owner might have had reasons to keep it running. The blazer for an interview is a valid point\u2014maybe the person needed it to be fully dry, and taking it out early caused wrinkles or wasn't properly dried. \n\nThe author's intention was to help by freeing up a dryer, but they didn't ask first. Maybe they should have communicated with the person or waited their turn. However, the problem of limited dryers is on the dorm's side for not having enough. The author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, still interfered with someone else's property. \n\nSo, balancing the intention to help against the act of taking without permission. On one hand, it's a shared space, and the dryers are a limited resource. On the other, taking someone else's clothes is a privacy issue. The note the person left seems harsh, but the act might still be considered wrong. \n\nI think the key here is whether taking someone else's clothes is acceptable even if the intention is good. The author might not be in the wrong if they acted out of necessity, but the action itself is still questionable. However, the fact that the dryer was set for 75 minutes and the clothes were already dry could mean the owner wasn't using the machine efficiently. But that's not an excuse for taking someone else's items. \n\nIn conclusion, the author probably did act inconsiderately, but the situation is a bit complex. The dorm's lack of dryers is a contributing factor. But the act of taking the clothes without permission is the main issue. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
