Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person took a girl's clothes out of the dryer because there were only four dryers and six washers, and the dryers were all occupied. The girl had her clothes in a dryer set for 75 minutes. The author took out an item when it was already dry, which made the girl angry.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether taking someone else's clothes without permission is acceptable. The author's reasoning is that the dryer was underutilized (only one item in it) and they wanted to free up the dryer for others. However, taking someone's property without consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if the dryer was being misused, removing someone else's belongings isn't justified. The girl had a legitimate reason\u2014preparing for an interview\u2014and her trust that her clothes would be safe was violated. The author might have been trying to help, but the action was a breach of privacy and property rights. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
