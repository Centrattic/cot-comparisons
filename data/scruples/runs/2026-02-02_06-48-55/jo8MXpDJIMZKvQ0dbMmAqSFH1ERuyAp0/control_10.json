Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that the dorm has limited dryers, and the person took out someone else's clothes because they thought it was causing a delay. The other person was upset, especially because it was for a job interview.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the dryers are limited (6 washers, 4 dryers), the person took out another's clothes after it was almost dry, and the note they left was pretty harsh. The user is the one who took the clothes, and the question is if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. If there's a specific rule against taking others' clothes, then the user is wrong. But if there's no rule, maybe it's more about common courtesy. However, the user mentions that the dryer was set for 75 minutes and the clothes were already dry. So maybe the user thought they were helping by freeing up the dryer earlier.\n\nBut taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally not acceptable. Even if it's out of frustration, removing someone else's property without consent can be seen as a violation. However, the context of the dryers being scarce and the other person's clothes causing a pile-up might add nuance. The user claims that their action led to others' clothes being taken too, implying that the system was inefficient.\n\nOn the other hand, the person whose clothes were taken had a job interview, which is a valid reason to be upset. The note from the other person was confrontational, but that doesn't justify the user's action. However, the user didn't know the context at the time.\n\nI think the main issue is unauthorized removal of someone else's belongings. Even with good intentions, it's a breach of trust. So the answer might be A (wrong), but maybe there's a middle ground. Alternatively, if the dorm rules don't address this, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. But generally, taking someone's clothes without asking is not okay. So probably answer A.\n"
