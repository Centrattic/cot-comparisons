Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. So, the situation is that there are limited dryers in the dorm, and the author found all the dryers taken. They took a girl's clothes out of one that was set for 75 minutes but only needed 40. The girl was upset because she was using the dryer for her job interview blazer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. If there's a policy against taking others' clothes from the dryer, then the author is in the wrong. But if there's no such rule, maybe it's more about common courtesy. The author mentions that there were piles of wet clothes around, implying others weren't using the dryers efficiently. They took out the jacket because it was already dry, which might have freed up the dryer for someone else. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a privacy and respect issue. Even if the dryer was underutilized, removing someone's belongings without consent could be seen as violating their trust. The girl had a valid reason for needing the blazer dry, so the author's action might have caused her unnecessary stress. On the other hand, the author might have thought they were helping by preventing dryer hoarding. But since the dryer was still running, taking the clothes out prematurely could damage the item. So, even if the intention was good, the action was probably not appropriate. The right thing would have been to ask if the dryer was in use or if they could share it, rather than taking it without permission. So, the answer is A.\n"
