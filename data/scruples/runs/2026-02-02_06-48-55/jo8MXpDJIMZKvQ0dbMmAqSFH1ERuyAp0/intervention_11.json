Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is at a college dorm with limited dryers. The author found all dryers occupied, and other people's wet clothes were piling up. They took a jacket from a dryer that had been running for 75 minutes, took it out because it was dry enough, and then left a note. The girl was upset because she was using the dryer for her blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. The dorm probably doesn't have specific rules about this, but generally, you don't take others' belongings without permission. Even if the dryer is taking too long, removing someone else's clothes is a privacy issue. The author assumed the jacket was theirs and took it, but they had no right to do that.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that taking the jacket helped free up the dryer, but that doesn't justify taking someone else's clothes. The other person had a legitimate reason for needing the jacket dry for an interview. The author's action could have caused her stress or inconvenience. Even if the jacket was dry, removing it without asking was still a violation of trust and respect for others' property.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to solve a problem with limited resources. But the proper way would be to ask the dryer user if they could take it out, not assume. Since the author didn't know whose clothes they were, taking them was wrong. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
