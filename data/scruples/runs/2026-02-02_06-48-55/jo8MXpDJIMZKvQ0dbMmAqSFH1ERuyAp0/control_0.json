Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that there were only 4 dryers in a college dorm with 6 washers. They found all dryers taken, so they took a jacket that had been in for 75 minutes and was already dry, removed it, and hung it up. Later, the owner left a note angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. The dorm probably has shared laundry facilities, so using them appropriately is important. The user took someone's clothes without permission, which is a breach of trust. Even if the dryer was overused, taking someone else's items without asking is a problem. The person might argue they were being considerate by freeing up the dryer, but that's not the owner's clothes to decide. The other person was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, which is important and time-sensitive. The fact that the author didn't check if the jacket was theirs might mean they assumed it was okay, but that's not a valid assumption. So, the author took something that wasn't theirs, which is inconsiderate and potentially damaging if the clothes needed more drying. Even if the jacket was dry, it's about respecting others' belongings. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
