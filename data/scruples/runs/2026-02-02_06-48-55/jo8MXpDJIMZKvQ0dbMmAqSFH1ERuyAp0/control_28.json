Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is a college dorm with limited dryers. The author took a girl's clothes out of the dryer because all dryers were occupied, and the girl had one item set for 75 minutes. The clothes were already dry, so he took them out. The girl got mad, left a note, and now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. If the dorm has specific rules about not taking others' clothes from the dryer, then the author might be at fault. But if there are no rules, it's more about common courtesy.\n\nThe dryers are a shared resource. The girl had her clothes in the dryer, even if it's taking longer. The author took them out because the dryers were all in use, but that's not a valid reason. It's not the girl's fault that her dryer time is longer. The author's action could have ruined her blazer, which she needed for an interview. She mentioned it was for a job interview, so the situation is more serious for her.\n\nEven though the clothes were relatively dry, taking someone else's belongings without their permission is a breach of trust. The author might have assumed he was helping by freeing up the dryer, but others might have needed those dryers too. However, the main issue is unauthorized removal of someone else's property. \n\nAlso, the note she left seems harsh, but the author's action was still wrong. You shouldn't take things without permission, even if you think you're helping. There might have been a better way to approach the problem, like talking to her or waiting. The author didn't consider the consequences of his actions on her.\n\nSo, the answer is probably that the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
