Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is at fault. The scenario is about taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The dorm has limited dryers, and all were occupied. The person took a random girl's clothes out because they were only drying for 75 minutes and the item was already relatively dry. The girl got angry and left a note about not taking others' clothes from an on dryer. The author argues that the dryer situation was a problem because of the piles of wet clothes, and by taking hers out, others could use the dryers more efficiently.\n\nHmm. So the main points here are about respecting others' property versus the necessity due to limited resources. The author's defense is that the dryer was underutilized (only one item) and that doing so helped free up the dryer for others. On the other hand, taking someone's clothes without permission is a violation of their belongings. Even if the item was almost dry, the act of removing it without consent could be seen as trespassing on someone else's items. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the dorm's resource management. If the dryers are a shared resource and the system is inefficient (6 washers vs. 4 dryers), maybe the dorm should have guidelines. However, the user's action bypasses the system, which could lead to conflicts. The girl was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, which is a time-sensitive need. The author's action might have disrupted her plans, even if briefly.\n\nSo, while the author's intention was to alleviate the problem of long waits, the method was inappropriate. It's about respecting others' property regardless of the situation. Even if the clothes were mostly dry, the act of taking them without asking is a breach of trust and common courtesy. The author could have waited their turn or contacted dorm management instead. Therefore, the author is at fault here.\n"
