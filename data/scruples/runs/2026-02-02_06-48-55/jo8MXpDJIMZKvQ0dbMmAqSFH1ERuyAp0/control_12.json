Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is that there are only 4 dryers in a dorm with 6 washers. The author found all dryers taken, so they took one that had just one item and was set for 75 minutes. After 40 minutes, they took the item out because it was dry. The other person left a note upset about it, as she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nSo, the key points here. The dryers were all in use, which is a problem because there's a shortage. The author took an item from someone else's dryer to free it up. The item was already dry, so maybe it was done out of necessity. But taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally not okay, even if there's a shortage. \n\nThe other person's note implies that the author disrupted her important task. Even if the author thought they were helping, removing someone else's property without consent is a breach of trust. However, the dryers being overused by others might be a systemic issue. But that doesn't excuse taking someone else's clothes. The author could have waited or tried to communicate with the dryer user first. So, while the author had a reason, they acted without permission, which is the main issue. So the answer is probably A, they are in the wrong.\n"
