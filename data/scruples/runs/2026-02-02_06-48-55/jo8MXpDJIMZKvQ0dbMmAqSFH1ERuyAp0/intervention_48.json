Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author of the story did something wrong by taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. So, the situation is that there's a limited number of dryers in the dorm\u20146 washers, 4 dryers. The author is doing laundry, and when they go to use the dryer, all are taken. There's a lot of wet clothes around, and this girl has a dryer set for 75 minutes. The author takes the one item (probably a jacket) out after it's relatively dry, then leaves, and later gets a note from the girl about the incident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and norms. In shared laundry facilities, is it customary to not touch others' clothes? Probably yes. Taking someone else's items without permission is generally considered a breach of trust and respect. Even if the dryer is underutilized, the clothes belong to someone else, so removing them without asking might be seen as interfering. \n\nThe author mentions that the dryer was set for 75 minutes, but they took the clothes out after 40 minutes. The girl was using one item, but the author decided to take it because the dryer wasn't being used efficiently. However, the girl's note mentions she was drying a blazer for an interview, which is important. The author might not have known the item's significance. But does that matter? Even if the item wasn't important, taking someone else's clothes without permission is still an issue.\n\nAnother angle is the context. The author says that after they took the clothes out, the piles of wet clothes around disappeared. So maybe they were trying to free up a dryer. But the problem is that they took someone else's clothes without asking. Even if their intention was to help, using someone else's property without consent is problematic. \n\nThe author might argue that the dryer wasn't being used efficiently and that the clothes were already dry. However, the fact remains that the clothes were not theirs. The girl had a right to use the dryer for her items, and the author's action disrupted her plans. Even if the jacket was dry, the act of removing it without permission is a violation of personal space and trust.\n\nSo, even though the author had a good intention, the action itself is wrong. The key point is respecting others' belongings. In shared spaces, people generally expect their clothes to remain untouched. The author should have waited or tried another dryer instead of taking someone else's clothes. Therefore, the author is at fault here.\n"
