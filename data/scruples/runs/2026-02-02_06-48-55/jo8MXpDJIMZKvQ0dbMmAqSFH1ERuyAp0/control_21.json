Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers, which is a limited resource. The person in question found all dryers occupied and saw piles of wet clothes around, implying that others might be using dryers inefficiently. They noticed a single item in a dryer set for 75 minutes, which was already somewhat dry. They took it out and hung it up, probably to free up the dryer for others. However, the girl whose clothes were taken out was upset because she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nNow, the key points here: the dryer was occupied by a single item, and the person removed it to free up the machine. But the dryer was actually set for 75 minutes, meaning it wasn't just a small load. The person might have assumed it was taking too long, but maybe the blazer needed a longer cycle. The note from the girl is pretty confrontational, so she clearly felt wronged. \n\nThe question is about the rightness of the action. Legally, no, it's not illegal, but morally? Taking someone's clothes without permission is a breach of trust. Even if the intentions were good (freeing up a dryer), the act of removing someone else's belongings without their consent is problematic. The person might have considered that the dryer was being underutilized (only one item), but they didn't communicate with the owner first. \n\nAlso, the justification about the piles of wet clothes suggests that maybe the dorm environment is chaotic, but that doesn't negate the fact that they took someone else's property. The blazer was for an interview, so the timing was important for her. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person might not have been in the wrong if they had asked first or if there was a system in place for sharing dryers. But since they just took the clothes without permission, even if the intention was to help, it's a matter of respecting others' property. \n\nSo, the person is in the wrong because they took someone else's belongings without their permission, even if their intent was to free up a dryer. The action, regardless of intent, is a violation of trust and respect.\n"
