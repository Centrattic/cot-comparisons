Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. So, the situation is that the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author noticed all dryers were full, and there were piles of wet clothes around. They took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, which was already somewhat dry, and hung it up. Then the girl left a note angry about it.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author did something wrong. The girl was using the dryer for her blazer for an interview, which is important. The author might have felt that the dryer was being misused, taking up a spot when others needed it. But taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally not okay, right? Even if the intention was to help free up the dryer, it's an invasion of their property. The author could have approached the girl and asked if she needed help or if she was done, instead of taking the item themselves. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that after they took the item, the piles of wet clothes disappeared, implying that the dryer was freed up for others. But that doesn't justify taking someone else's belongings. The right thing to do would be to communicate and perhaps suggest sharing the dryer time or asking if they're done. So, even if the dryers were in high demand, taking clothes without permission is a breach of trust and privacy. The girl had a valid reason for drying her blazer, and the author's action, while maybe well-intentioned, was unauthorized. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
