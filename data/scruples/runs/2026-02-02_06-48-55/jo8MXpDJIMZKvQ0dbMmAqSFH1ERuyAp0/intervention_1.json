Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author did the wrong thing by taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. That's a problem because dryers are limited. The author went to do laundry and found all dryers occupied. There were a lot of wet clothes around, implying that people might be holding onto dryers for too long. The author took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, which was already relatively dry. Then they hung it up. Later, the owner of the clothes left a note expressing anger because the author took their jacket out, which was for a job interview. The author argues that they intervened to free up the dryer, and after that, other piles of clothes disappeared, suggesting that the dryers were being misused.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author have a right to take someone else's clothes without permission? Even if the dryer was being held for a long time, is it acceptable to take someone else's property? The owner might have had a valid reason (job interview), so the author's action could have caused stress or inconvenience. However, the author might have felt they were helping to alleviate a common problem in the dorm. But is taking clothes without asking a violation of trust or property rights?\n\nIn most cases, taking someone else's belongings, even with good intentions, is considered wrong because it's an invasion of their privacy and ownership. The author didn't ask permission, which is a key factor. Even if the dryer was being misused, the proper approach might have been to talk to the person or report the issue to dorm management instead of taking the clothes themselves.\n\nAlso, the fact that the clothes were for a job interview adds weight to the owner's frustration. The author might not have known about the urgency, but taking the clothes without consent could still be seen as inconsiderate and a breach of trust. Even if the clothes were mostly dry, the act of taking them without permission is problematic.\n\nSo, considering these points, I think the author is in the wrong because they took someone else's property without consent, regardless of the reasoning. The correct approach would have been to find another solution rather than taking the clothes themselves.\n"
