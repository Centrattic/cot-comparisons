Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of a dryer. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the dorm has six washers but only four dryers. The author noticed all the dryers were occupied and there were a lot of wet clothes around. They had one item in a dryer, which was set for 75 minutes. After 40 minutes, the clothes were mostly dry, so they took them out and hung them up. Later, the other person left a note saying they were using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, and they were upset the author took the clothes out.\n\nThe author argues that they were trying to free up the dryer, which might have helped others get their clothes dried. But the other person was clearly using the dryer for something important. So, the question is, was the author wrong to take those clothes out?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. If the dorm doesn't have a specific policy against this, maybe the author thought it was okay. But generally, using someone else's clothes without permission is a problem. Even if there's a shortage, taking someone else's items could be seen as violating their rights. The other person might have been using the dryer for a reason, and the author's action disrupted that. \n\nAlso, the note the other person left is pretty harsh, but it's clear they were upset. The author might have thought they were helping, but they didn't ask first. Maybe there's a better way to handle the situation, like waiting or talking to others about sharing dryers. However, the author's intention was to help with the overall problem of the dryer shortage. \n\nBut ownership is a key factor here. Even if the clothes were just left in the dryer, taking them without permission isn't right. The other person had a legitimate need, and the author's action caused inconvenience. On the other hand, the author might not have known, but the responsibility is still there to check or ask.\n\nI think the balance is on the side of the author being in the wrong because they took someone else's property without consent. Even if their intention was to help, the action itself was inappropriate. The other person's needs are valid, and the author should have found another solution, like waiting or communicating.\n"
