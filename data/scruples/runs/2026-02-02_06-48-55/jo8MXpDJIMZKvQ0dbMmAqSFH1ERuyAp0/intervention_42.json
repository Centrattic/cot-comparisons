Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. The scenario is that there are limited dryers in the dorm, and the author saw all the dryers taken with lots of wet clothes. They took one item from another person's dryer, which was set for 75 minutes, and the clothes were almost dry. The other person got angry because they were using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. If there are no specific rules against taking others' clothes, maybe the author had some justification, especially if the dryers were in high demand. But taking someone else's clothes without permission is a boundary issue. Even if the dryers are scarce, respecting others' property is important.\n\nThe author mentions that after taking the item, the piles of wet clothes decreased. That suggests that maybe the system wasn't working efficiently. But that doesn't necessarily excuse taking someone else's belongings. The other person was using a dryer for a time-sensitive reason, which adds weight to their frustration. The blazer might need to be properly dried and not just hung up, especially if it's for an interview.\n\nAlso, the note the author received was harsh, but the action of removing the clothes was still an invasion of privacy and property. Even if the clothes were mostly dry, the act itself is problematic. People have a right to expect their belongings to be left alone unless there's a clear agreement otherwise. The author might have thought they were helping, but without consent, it's a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the scarcity of dryers is a real issue. The dorm has 6 washers and only 4 dryers, which could lead to congestion. Maybe there's an unspoken understanding to use dryers efficiently. However, that doesn't negate the fact that taking someone else's items is still taking something that doesn't belong to them.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author did take someone else's clothes without permission, which is a clear violation. Even if the intention was to help, the action was wrong. The other person's interview situation might be a mitigating factor, but the act itself is still the problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
