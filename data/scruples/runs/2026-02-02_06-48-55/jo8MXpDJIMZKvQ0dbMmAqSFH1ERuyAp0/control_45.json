Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is that there are 6 washers but only 4 dryers in the college dorm. The author found all dryers occupied and saw other people's wet clothes around. They took a girl's clothes that had been drying for 75 minutes, took out one item that was already dry, and hung it up. Then the girl left a note angry about it.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break this down. First, the context: limited dryers, which is a common issue in dorms. The author noticed that there were a lot of wet clothes around, implying that others were leaving their clothes in dryers unnecessarily. The girl in question had one item in the dryer for a long time. The author took out an already dry item, possibly thinking it was freeing up the dryer. But the girl was upset because she needed the jacket for an interview and was probably using the dryer to de-wrinkle it, not just dry it.\n\nSo, the author's defense is that they were trying to help by not letting dryers be occupied by already dry clothes. But the girl's perspective is that her clothes were being tampered with, especially for an important event. \n\nLegally, taking someone else's clothes without permission is probably a breach of privacy or property. Even if the dryer is shared, the clothes belong to the individual. So, the act of removing someone's clothes without their consent is wrong. But maybe there's a moral argument here. The dorm has limited dryers, and the author was trying to optimize usage. But the problem is that the author assumed the clothes were done and took them out, which might not have been the case. The girl was using the dryer for de-wrinkling, which might require the heat and tumbling even if the clothes were already dry. \n\nSo, the author might have acted out of a good intention but without considering the other person's needs. The note from the girl suggests she was upset because her preparation for an interview was affected. The author's action, while perhaps trying to be helpful, was a violation of the girl's property. Even if others were leaving clothes in dryers, the author shouldn't have taken someone else's clothes without asking. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the dorm might have rules about this. If there are no explicit rules, it's a matter of mutual respect. The author's action was intrusive. Even if the dryer was being misused, the appropriate step would be to ask the person to take their clothes out if they're not needed, not to take them without permission. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they took someone else's belongings without consent, regardless of their reasoning.\n"
