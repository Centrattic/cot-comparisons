Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that there are more washers than dryers in the dorm. The user found all dryers taken, with a lot of wet clothes around. They took a single item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, took it out after 40 minutes because it was already dry. Then the girl left a note angry about it. The user says that by taking the item, they helped free up the dryer, and others' clothes had disappeared by the time they came back.\n\nSo the main points here: Did the user have the right to take someone else's clothes? The dryers were in high demand. The user noticed the dryer was being used inefficiently (only one item), so they took it out early. The clothes were already dry. But the owner was upset because she needed the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nOn one hand, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally wrong. It's their property. Even if the dryer was underused, removing items that aren't your own could be seen as a privacy or property violation. The note from the girl makes it clear she was using it for an important interview, so maybe the item wasn't just a regular piece of clothing.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation is tight with limited dryers. The user tried to help by freeing up a dryer, which might have helped others. The item was already dry, so maybe the user didn't cause any harm. The user might not have known it was someone else's until they came back. But still, taking without asking is problematic.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and ownership. The user didn't own the clothes, so taking them without permission is a breach. However, the context of limited resources and the clothes being dry might mitigate some of the blame. But generally, taking someone else's belongings is considered wrong. Even if the user thought they were helping, they shouldn't have assumed ownership or taken it without asking. The girl had a right to be upset because her clothes were being taken without her consent. Even if the dryer was underused, it's not the user's place to decide to take someone else's items. So the answer is probably A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
