Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes.

LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The situation is from a college dorm with limited dryers. The person took a jacket from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes but only ran for 40. They left a note, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The dryers are a shared resource, and there's a shortage (6 washers, 4 dryers). The author mentions that the dryer was only set for one item, but when they took it out, the jacket was already dry. The person left a note, implying the author did something wrong. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were trying to free up a dryer because others had wet clothes piling up. They took the jacket since it was dry enough, and then more dryers became available. The question is whether this action was justified or not.\n\nOn one hand, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally considered wrong. It's invading their property and could lead to misunderstandings or conflicts. Even if the intention was to help others, removing clothes that aren't yours can be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate. The person whose clothes it was might have needed the jacket for an important event, like an interview, so the timing could matter a lot for them.\n\nOn the other hand, the dorm has a limited number of dryers, and the author was trying to manage the shared resource efficiently. They noticed that the dryer was only holding one item and decided to take it out since it was dry. The author might have thought that by doing so, they were helping others who had piles of wet clothes waiting. However, even if the intention was good, the action of removing someone else's belongings without their consent is problematic. \n\nThe key here is consent. Even in a shared space, each person's laundry is their personal responsibility. The author didn't ask the girl if they could take her jacket; they just did it. This could be seen as overstepping, especially since the dryer was set for a longer time, and the jacket might not have been fully dry. The note from the girl indicates she was using the dryer for a specific purpose, which the author might not have been aware of.\n\nAlso, considering the consequences: the jacket wasn't fully dried, and the girl had to deal with the situation. Even if the jacket was relatively dry, the act of someone else handling her clothes could be stressful, especially if it's for an interview. The author's action, while maybe well-intentioned, disrupted another person's plan without their consent. \n\nIn shared spaces, it's important to communicate and respect others' belongings. There might be a better way to handle the dryer shortage, like talking to the dorm staff, using a timer to check dryers periodically, or politely asking if someone is done with the dryer after a certain time. Taking initiative to manage resources is commendable, but without permission, it crosses into inconsiderate behavior.\n\nSo, weighing the intentions against the actions, the author probably is in the wrong. They should have asked before taking the clothes, even if they thought it was for the greater good. The girl's frustration is understandable because her personal items were handled without her consent, and the situation could have been avoided with better communication.\n"
