Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation: the dorm has limited dryers. The author noticed all dryers were taken, with lots of wet clothes around. They found a dryer with one item (a jacket) set for 75 minutes, took it out after 40 minutes because it was dry, and then got a note from the owner who was using it for an interview.\n\nThe key points here are intent and impact. The author's intention was to free up a dryer, which they felt was necessary due to the limited number. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a violation of their property. Even if the author thought the clothes were dry, removing them without asking is an invasion of privacy and could cause issues, especially for the owner who needed the item for an important event.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner could have communicated better. If the dryer was only for one item, maybe she should have used a different machine or checked back. But the fact remains that the author took the clothes without permission. \n\nSocietal norms suggest that people should respect others' belongings. Even in a shared space, taking someone else's items without consent is generally wrong, regardless of the reason. The author might have been trying to help, but the action itself is problematic. The owner's note was a valid expression of her frustration, especially since the jacket was for an interview. \n\nSo, while the author's action was understandable given the context, it's still a breach of trust and respect. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
