Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is in a college dorm with limited dryers. They noticed all dryers were taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes. They took out someone's item that had been drying for 75 minutes, which was already dry, and hung it up. Later, the person left a note about it.\n\nSo, first, the dryers are a limited resource. The user's argument is that the dryers were all in use, and others had wet clothes piling up. They took action to free up the dryer by removing a single item that was already dry. However, the other person was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, which is important. The user says that after their action, the surrounding piles of wet clothes disappeared, implying that others then used the dryers. But the other person was upset, possibly because their item wasn't fully dried yet or they were planning to use the dryer for more time.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, taking someone's clothes without permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if the dryers are limited, each person has the right to use the dryer for their own items. The user might have thought they were helping, but removing someone else's clothes without asking could be seen as trespassing on another person's property. The other person was using the dryer for a specific purpose, which the user interrupted. Even if the item was dry, the user didn't own it, so taking it without consent is a violation. However, the user's intention was to free up the dryer, which could be seen as trying to help the community. But the line is crossed when they take someone else's belongings. The note left by the other person was harsh, but the user's action was still a breach of privacy and property. So the answer might lean towards A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
