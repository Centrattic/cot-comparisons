Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person took someone else's clothes out of the dryer when they were using it. The dryer was set for 75 minutes, and after 40 minutes, they removed the clothes. The other person was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview, which probably needed more precise drying to avoid wrinkles.\n\nFirst, the dorm has a limited number of dryers, so maybe there was a shortage. The user mentions that others had piles of wet clothes, implying that the system was inefficient. However, taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer without permission is a direct invasion of their property. Even if the dryer was set for a long time, removing their clothes could damage the items or affect the drying process, especially if it's delicate like a blazer. The note from the other person suggests they were actively trying to preserve the jacket's appearance, which is important for an interview. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that they needed to free up the dryer, but there's no mention of trying to communicate with the other person first. Maybe they could have asked if they could wait or if they could check back later. Instead, they took it upon themselves, which led to the conflict. \n\nSo, while the situation is understandable due to the limited resources, taking someone's belongings without consent is generally wrong. The user might have been trying to help the overall situation, but their action violated the other person's rights. The correct approach would have been to find another solution, like waiting or asking, rather than removing someone else's clothes. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
