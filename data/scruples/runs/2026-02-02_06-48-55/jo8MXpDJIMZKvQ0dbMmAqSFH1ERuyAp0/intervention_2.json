Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by taking someone else's clothes from the dryer. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author found all dryers occupied when they went to dry their laundry. They mention that there were piles of wet clothes around, implying that others were waiting. The author took one item from a dryer that had been running for 75 minutes, which was already dry, and hung it up. Later, a note was left by the owner, who was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview. The author's action caused her to be upset because she was waiting to finish her drying.\n\nNow, the key points here. The dryer was in use by someone else, and the author took their clothes without permission. Even though the item was dry, removing it from the dryer without consent is a violation of others' property and trust. The dryers are limited, so the author might be frustrated, but taking someone else's clothes isn't a solution. The author could have waited their turn or used another method instead of interfering. The owner's frustration is understandable, especially since she needed the clothes for an important event. Even if the author's intention was to free up a dryer, it's not their place to decide who gets priority. So, while the author might have had a reason, the action was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
