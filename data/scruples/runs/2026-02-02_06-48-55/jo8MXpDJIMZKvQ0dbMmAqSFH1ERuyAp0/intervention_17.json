Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person took someone else's clothes from the dryer without asking. The situation is a college dorm with limited dryers. The author saw that all dryers were taken, and other people's wet clothes were piling up. They took someone's item that was in the dryer for 75 minutes, which was already dry.\n\nThe main question is whether they did something wrong. The person left a note, angry about the blazer for an interview. The author's reasoning is that they were trying to free up a dryer, which helped reduce the pile of clothes. But did they overstep by taking someone else's clothes?\n\nIn public spaces like dorms, there's usually an unspoken rule to use shared facilities responsibly. Taking someone's clothes without permission could be seen as violating that trust. Even if the dryer was being misused (one item for 75 minutes), taking clothes without asking is a breach of respect for others' property. There might be a better way, like asking if the dryer is available or if they can use it. The author could have asked if the person was done or if they needed the dryer, instead of taking it themselves. So, while the intention was to help, the action was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
