Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. They mentioned that the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author took a girl's clothes out of the dryer because all dryers were taken, and there were piles of wet clothes. The girl left a note saying not to do that, as she was using the dryer for a blazer for a job interview.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the situation. The dryers are limited, so there's a scarcity there. The author took someone else's clothes out without permission. Even if the clothes were almost dry, removing them from the dryer would prevent that person from finishing their laundry. The author might have been trying to help by freeing up the dryer, but taking others' clothes out isn't their responsibility. \n\nThe note from the girl says that she was using it for a blazer for an interview, which is important. The author didn't know, but that doesn't excuse the action. It's a common rule to not touch others' belongings. Even if there's a problem with the system (like not enough dryers), the solution shouldn't be to take others' clothes. \n\nThe author might have thought they were helping, but their action caused a conflict. The right thing would be to talk to the person or maybe report the issue to the dorm staff instead of taking matters into their own hands. So, I think the author is in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
