Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they took someone else's clothes out of the dryer without permission. The dryer was the only one available, and all the dryers were taken. The author mentions there were a lot of wet clothes around, implying that other people were waiting. They took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, and it was already pretty dry. The other person was using it for an interview blazer.\n\nHmm. The first thing that comes to mind is that taking someone else's clothes without asking is generally not okay. Even if the dryer is in short supply, you can't just take someone else's stuff. It's their property, and they have a right to have their clothes dried properly. The author made an assumption that it was okay to take it because it was \"relatively dry\" and to \"intervene\" this hold-up. But that's not really their decision to make. The other person had a valid reason too\u2014using the blazer for an interview. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author was trying to be helpful by freeing up the dryer? But the dryer wasn't actually done. It was set for 75 minutes, and the author took it out after 40. The clothes might not be completely dry, and taking them out early could have ruined the blazer. Plus, the note from the person seems pretty upset about it. They probably expected their clothes to be left alone. \n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that there were mounds of wet clothes because people like the girl. So, maybe the author felt justified because they saw others not being efficient. But that's not a valid excuse. It's not their responsibility to police others' laundry habits. If the dryer was in high demand, maybe the dorm should have more dryers. But that's a different issue. \n\nSo, the key points are: taking someone else's clothes without permission is wrong, regardless of the reason. The author didn't own the clothes, didn't ask, and their action could have caused damage. Even if they thought they were helping, it was a violation of trust and respect for others' belongings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
