Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the dorm has limited dryers, and the author saw that all four were taken. There were a bunch of wet clothes from other people. The author took out someone else's clothes from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, but after 40 minutes, they took the item out, thinking it was dry enough. The other person was upset because she was drying a blazer for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the dorm. Do they allow taking others' clothes out of the dryer? If there's a rule against it, then the author is definitely in the wrong. But if there's no specific rule, maybe it's more about common courtesy. \n\nThe author mentions that there were a lot of wet clothes around, implying that others weren't using the dryers efficiently. The author might have felt justified in taking action to free up a dryer. However, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of trust. Even if the clothes were almost dry, removing them could affect the owner's plans (like an interview). \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought they were helping by reducing the pile of wet clothes. But the problem is that they didn't ask the owner first. It's possible the blazer needed the full drying time to be properly dry or wrinkle-free. The note the author received suggests that the person was using the dryer for a specific purpose, which the author interrupted. \n\nSo, while the author's intention was to help, they acted without permission, which is a breach of respect for others' property. Even if the dryer was in high demand, taking someone else's clothes without their consent is generally considered wrong. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
