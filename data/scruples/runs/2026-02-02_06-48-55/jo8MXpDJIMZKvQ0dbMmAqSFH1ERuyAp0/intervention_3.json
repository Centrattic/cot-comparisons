Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. The story is from a college dorm setting where there are limited dryers. The author noticed all dryers were taken, with lots of wet clothes around. They took a girl's item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, took it out after 40 minutes because it was already dry. The girl left a note angry about it. The author argues that they were trying to free up the dryer and that the clothes were mostly dry, but the girl was upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the wrong thing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The dryers are a limited resource. The author saw all dryers were occupied, and there were piles of wet clothes. Taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer without permission, even if it was to help others, is a breach of trust. The person who left the note was expecting her clothes to be in the dryer for the full cycle, and the author's action disrupted that. Even if the clothes were dry, removing them without consent is an invasion of someone else's property. \n\nBut then, the situation is that the author might have been trying to be helpful. However, the problem is that it's not their place to decide for others. The girl had a reason for her clothes being in the dryer (preparing for an interview), which is important. The author's action caused her stress and inconvenience. \n\nAlso, in dorm settings, there are usually rules about using machines and not taking others' items. The author's action could set a bad precedent, leading to more people taking others' clothes, which would escalate the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt they were doing a good deed by freeing up a dryer, but the right approach would have been to maybe ask if the dryer was being used, or if someone could use it, rather than taking the clothes without permission. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author took someone else's property without consent, which is a clear wrong. The justification of helping others doesn't negate the fact that it was an unauthorized action. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
