Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes out of the dryer is in the wrong. So the situation is that there are 6 washers and 4 dryers in the dorm. The person went to do their laundry and found all dryers taken. There were lots of wet clothes around. They took one item from a dryer that was set for 75 minutes, which was already pretty dry. Then the owner left a note upset about it, saying it was for a job interview blazer.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are intent, context, and reasonable expectations. The author's reasoning is that they were trying to free up a dryer because others were leaving clothes in for too long. They thought it was okay because the item was already dry. The other person was upset because it was important for an interview.\n\nOn one hand, taking someone else's property without permission is generally not acceptable. Even if the dryer was being misused, the owner still has a right to their belongings. The author didn't own the clothes, so removing them could be seen as theft or trespassing in a way. Even if the clothes were dry enough, the act of taking them without consent is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the situation is a shared space with limited resources. The dryers are a bottleneck, and others are not using them efficiently. The author might have felt it was a necessary action to prevent others from hoarding dryers. However, the correct approach would be to report the misuse to dorm staff or find another solution, not to take matters into their own hands.\n\nThe note from the other person is confrontational, but that doesn't negate the author's wrongdoing. The author should have respected the other person's ownership. Even if the dryer was being misused, the solution isn't to take someone's clothes. The author could have waited, asked politely, or informed the dorm staff. Taking the clothes was an overreach, regardless of the motivation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). They didn't have the right to remove someone else's belongings without permission, even if they thought it was justified.\n"
