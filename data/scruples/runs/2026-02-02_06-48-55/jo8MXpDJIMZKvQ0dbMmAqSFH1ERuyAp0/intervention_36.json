Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer.\n\nFirst, the situation: the dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author finds all dryers taken and sees a lot of wet clothes around. The girl in question had one item in a dryer set for 75 minutes. The author took out their own clothes, noticed the dryer situation, took the girl's item out because it was \"relatively dry,\" and then hung it up. The girl left a note expressing her anger because she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. The author took someone else's clothes from a dryer without permission. That's a basic invasion of property right. Even if the dryer was crowded, taking another's items without consent is a problem.\n\n2. The author mentions that the dryer was on for 75 minutes. The clothes might not be fully dry. The author interrupted the drying process, which could ruin the item, especially if it's a blazer for an important interview. The note from the girl suggests that the dryer was on a specific cycle for her item.\n\n3. The author's justification is that they were trying to free up dryers for others. While the dorm had a shortage, that doesn't give the right to take someone else's belongings. The solution should involve communication or waiting, not taking matters into one's own hands.\n\n4. The author claims the item was \"relatively dry,\" but that's subjective. The dryer was set for 75 minutes, so interrupting it at 40 minutes might not be safe. The girl's note emphasizes she was de-wrinkling the blazer, which might require a full cycle.\n\n5. The author's action caused direct harm to the girl's situation. The blazer might not be dry enough for her interview now. The author's action, while maybe well-intentioned (freeing up dryers), was a breach of trust and possibly illegal (theft, even if temporary).\n\n6. The dorm rules might have addressed shared appliance use. If there's a policy, the author might have violated it. Even without policies, general etiquette would suggest asking before taking someone else's items.\n\nPossible counterpoints: The author was trying to help by freeing up dryers. The dorm's limited dryers caused the problem. However, the right to property is stronger than the intention to help. The author should have waited their turn or communicated with the dryer user.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was a breach of the girl's property rights, even if done with good intentions. The harm caused to the girl (a blazer for an interview) is significant. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
