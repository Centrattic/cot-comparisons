Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking someone else's clothes from a dryer.\n\nSo, the person was doing laundry at the dorm. There are 6 washers but only 4 dryers. When they went to use the dryer, all were taken. They noticed other people's wet clothes around, which might imply others are using the dryers inefficiently. The person took a dryer that had just one item (a jacket) that was set for 75 minutes. They took it out after 40 minutes because it was already dry and hung it up. The girl left a note upset about it because she was using that dryer for her blazer for an interview.\n\nNow, the key points here: The dryer was on, and the jacket was only halfway through the cycle. The person took it out to free up the dryer, which allowed others to use it. But the girl was upset because she needed the dryer for her blazer. \n\nFrom a rules perspective, most places probably expect you to use your own dryer and not interfere with others' items. Even if the dryer was underutilized (only one item), taking someone else's clothes could be seen as respecting their belongings. Plus, the jacket was still in the drying cycle, so interrupting it might have affected the outcome. \n\nOn the other hand, the dorm has a limited number of dryers, and the person was trying to be considerate by freeing up a machine when the item was already mostly dry. The note mentions that the person had left piles of wet clothes, implying inefficiency. But the act of taking someone else's clothes without permission is a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person might have assumed the dryers were being misused, but taking someone else's clothes is a direct action that affects another person's property. The girl was using the dryer for an important purpose (interview), so interrupting her could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the person did act in a way that disrupted someone else's belongings without consultation. Even if their intention was to help, the action itself was intrusive. Therefore, the person might be in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes without permission.\n"
