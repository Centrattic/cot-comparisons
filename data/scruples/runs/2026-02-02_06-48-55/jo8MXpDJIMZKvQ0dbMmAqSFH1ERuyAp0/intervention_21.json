Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author did something wrong by taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer.\n\nSo, the situation is in a college dorm with limited dryers. The author noticed all dryers were full, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. They took their own clothes from the washer, saw a dryer with one item set for 75 minutes. The author took that item out because it was already pretty dry, hung it up, and then later got a note from the girl who was using the dryer. She was using it for a blazer for an interview.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were trying to free up the dryer since others had a lot of wet clothes, and they thought they were helping. But the girl was upset because she needed the dryer for her blazer.\n\nHmm. Well, taking someone else's clothes without permission is probably not okay. Even if the intention was to help, it's still someone else's property. The author didn't check with her first, so maybe that's the issue. Even if the dryer was slow, the proper thing might be to wait or use another dryer if available. But there were only 4 dryers, so maybe there was a shortage. However, removing someone else's clothes could cause problems for them. The blazer was in the dryer for 75 minutes, so taking it out early might have affected how dry it was. The author's note says it was \"relatively dry,\" but the girl might have needed it completely dry for her interview.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that after they took the item out, the piles of wet clothes disappeared. Maybe others started using the dryers after the one was freed up. But that doesn't justify taking someone else's clothes. It's a common area, but respecting others' belongings is important. Even in a shared space, you can't just take others' stuff without permission. The author could have waited or tried to find another way. So, I think the author was wrong, even if their intention was good. So the answer should be A.\n"
