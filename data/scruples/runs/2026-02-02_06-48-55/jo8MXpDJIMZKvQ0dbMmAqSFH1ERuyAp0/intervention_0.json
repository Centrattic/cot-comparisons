Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they took someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The dorm has limited dryers, and all were taken. The author saw a bunch of wet clothes around and decided to take a girl's clothes out of the dryer because it was set for 75 minutes and already seemed dry. The girl left a note upset about it, saying her blazer was for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules. Dorms usually have rules about using appliances, but maybe there's no specific rule against taking someone else's clothes. However, taking someone else's belongings without permission is a privacy issue. Even if the dryer was taking too long, removing clothes without asking is intrusive. The girl might have had a specific setting for her blazer, like a delicate cycle or to maintain the shape. The author assumed the clothes were okay to take out, but they might not have known the girl's intention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to free up a dryer because others were waiting. But there's a difference between managing shared resources and taking someone else's property. The author didn't own the clothes, so they shouldn't have removed them. Even if the clothes were dry, the act of taking them without permission is trespassing in someone else's belongings. The girl had a right to her clothes, and the author's action was disrespectful, even if their intention was to help.\n\nAlso, the note was harsh, but the author's action was the reason for the conflict. The girl was upset because her blazer was for an important interview, so the author's action directly affected her. The author might have considered asking if the clothes could be moved instead of taking them out. Communication is key in shared spaces. So, even if the author had good intentions, the action was wrong because it involved taking someone else's property without consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
