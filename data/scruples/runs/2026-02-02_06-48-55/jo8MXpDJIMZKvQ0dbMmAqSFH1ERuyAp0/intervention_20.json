Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that there are more washers than dryers in the dorm. The author went to do laundry and found all dryers occupied. There were a bunch of wet clothes around, including a jacket in a dryer set for 75 minutes. The author took the jacket out because it was already dry, which made the girl angry because she was using it for an interview.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the rules or norms in a shared laundry area. Usually, you're supposed to put your own clothes in the machines, right? Taking someone else's without permission is probably against the rules. But here, the author mentions that there were many people's clothes waiting. Maybe there's an unwritten rule that if you leave your clothes in the dryer for too long, others can take over the dryer? Or maybe the girl was using the dryer inefficiently by putting just one item in, which is a common complaint in dorms. \n\nThe author took the jacket out because it was already dry, which might have been a good idea to free up the dryer. But the problem is, they didn't ask the owner first. Even if the dryer was underutilized, taking someone else's clothes without consent is a privacy and property issue. The girl was upset because she needed the jacket for an interview, so the author's action might have caused her stress. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt justified because there were so many clothes waiting, and the dryer wasn't being used efficiently. However, the responsibility of managing shared resources usually lies with the users to communicate and follow the established rules. If there's no rule allowing others to take your clothes, the author did something wrong by taking them. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author's intention was to free up a dryer, but without permission, it's a violation. The girl might have been in the wrong for not using the dryer efficiently, but that doesn't justify the author taking her clothes. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
