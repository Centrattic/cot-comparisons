Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking someone else's clothes out of the dryer. The situation is that there were only four dryers in a college dorm with six washers. The author found all dryers taken, so they took one item from another person's load, which was still running. The other person left a note upset about it, saying they were using the dryer for a blazer for an interview. The author argues that they helped by freeing up the dryer, leading others to use it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and norms. In shared spaces like dorms, it's usually expected that people use their own dryers and not interfere. Taking someone else's clothes without permission is a breach of trust and could be seen as theft, even if the intention was to help. The author might argue they were helping by clearing up dryers, but the other person had a legitimate need for the blazer. The blazer being for an interview adds urgency. However, the author didn't check if the blazer was actually dry enough, which could have ruined it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that the dryer was only set for 75 minutes, and the item was already dry. They might have thought it was okay to take it to prevent others from being stuck. But the main issue is permission. Even if it helped others, taking someone's belongings without consent is a violation. The other person's frustration is justified because their property was taken without their knowledge. The note was a direct response, so the author's action was clearly perceived as wrong by the other party. \n\nAlso, the fact that there were mounds of wet clothes suggests that the dryers were in high demand, but that doesn't justify taking someone else's items. The proper approach would have been to wait or talk to others about the situation. The author didn't communicate with the owner, which is a problem. So, while the intention might have been to help, the action was unauthorized and caused harm to the other person's needs. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
