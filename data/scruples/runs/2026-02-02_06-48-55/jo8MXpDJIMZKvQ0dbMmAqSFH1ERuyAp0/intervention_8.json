Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about taking someone else's clothes out of a dryer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The dorm has 6 washers but only 4 dryers. The author saw all dryers were taken and there were lots of wet clothes around. The girl in question had one item in the dryer set for 75 minutes. The author took the item out after it was relatively dry, hung it up, and then got a note from her about not taking others' clothes from an on dryer. The author argues that they helped by using the dryer to free it up, but the girl was upset because she needed the jacket for an interview.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Is it wrong to take someone's clothes from the dryer when there's a shortage? Did the author have a right to do that? What's the expectation in shared spaces like dorms?\n\nI should consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that there was a shortage, and they were trying to be helpful by freeing up the dryer. The girl's side is that her clothes were left to dry properly, and someone else took them, which was inconsiderate and possibly ruined her blazer.\n\nIn shared spaces, there are usually community norms. Maybe there's an unspoken rule that you don't take others' items without asking. Even if the dryer was empty, taking someone's clothes could be seen as stealing. But the author thought they were helping. However, there's a lack of communication here. The author didn't ask the girl if she was done; they just took the clothes because they thought they were dry. The girl had a specific need for the blazer, so the timing was important.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not have known the clothes were hers. But in a dorm setting, it's possible that people might leave their clothes in the dryer without supervision. However, taking someone else's belongings without permission is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reason. Even if the intention was good, the action was unauthorized.\n\nAlso, the note says the dryer was set for 75 minutes, and the author took it out after 40 minutes. The jacket was \"relatively dry,\" but maybe the girl needed it to dry completely. The author's action might have affected her interview preparation.\n\nSo, even though the author tried to be helpful, taking someone's clothes without asking is a breach of trust and respect. The right thing to do would have been to wait their turn or ask the girl if they could use the dryer. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
