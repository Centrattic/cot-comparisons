Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes.

LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author was doing laundry in a college dorm with limited dryers. All four dryers were taken, and there were a lot of wet clothes around. The author found one dryer that had just one item (a jacket) and it had been running for 75 minutes. They took it out because it was already dry, hung it up, and then later received a note from the girl whose clothes it was, upset because she was using the dryer for a blazer for an interview.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were trying to free up a dryer since there were so many piles of wet clothes, which might be causing a bottleneck. They thought they were helping by removing an item that was already dry. But the girl was upset because she needed that dryer for her important blazer.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: ownership of the clothes, the rules of the laundry room, and intent.\n\nFirst, the clothes in the dryer were not the author's. Even if the dryer was underused, taking someone else's clothes without permission is generally considered wrong. The author assumed ownership by taking it out. Even if the jacket was dry, the act of removing someone else's property, even with good intentions, is a breach of trust.\n\nThe dorm probably has rules against taking others' clothes from the dryer. If there's a problem with people hoarding dryers, maybe the solution is to report that or talk to the dorm staff, not to take matters into one's own hands. The author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, was unauthorized and disrespectful to the owner's needs.\n\nAlso, the girl was using the dryer for an important purpose (a job interview blazer), which adds to the frustration. The author might not have considered that the jacket might still need more time, even if it looked dry, to prevent wrinkles or for proper drying. By taking it out, they might have ruined her blazer, especially if she was using a specific cycle for it.\n\nSo, even if the author thought they were helping, the action was a violation of others' rights. The correct approach would have been to wait, perhaps talk to the person using the dryer to ask if they could share, or contact the dorm staff about the issue. Taking without permission is wrong regardless of the reason. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
