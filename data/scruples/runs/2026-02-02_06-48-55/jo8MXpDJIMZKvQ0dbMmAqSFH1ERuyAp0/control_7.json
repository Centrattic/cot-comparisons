Doing my laundry yesterday, I noticed after taking my clothes out of the washer that all of the dryers were taken. And there were mounds of other people's wet clothes all around the room... because of people like this chick. Had one item in a dryer, set for 75 minutes. It was relatively dry, so I took it out and hung it up. \n\nCame back 40 minutes later and she left me a note saying \"HOT TIP DON'T TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S CLOTHES OUT OF AN ON DRYER. LOVE, A PERSON WHO WAS DEWRINKLING A BLAZER FOR A JOB INTERVIEW.\"\n\nSure, if I had know that, I would have left it. But in the meantime that I intervened this hold-up of dryers, most of the surrounding piles if wet clothes disappeared. The jacket was already pretty dry and looked fine. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took someone else's clothes from the dryer is in the wrong. The scenario is that there were 6 washers and 4 dryers in a college dorm. The author found all dryers taken, with lots of wet clothes around. They took one item from a dryer that had been running for 75 minutes, removed it when it was dry, and hung it up. Later, a note from the owner said not to do that, as she was using it for an interview.\n\nFirst, the main issue is unauthorized access to someone else's belongings. Even if the dryer was overfilled or taking too long, taking someone else's clothes without permission is a privacy and property issue. The author's action, while maybe understandable due to the crowded laundry situation, still crossed a line. They could have waited their turn, maybe offered to help, or found another solution instead of taking the clothes. The fact that the clothes were almost dry might reduce the harm, but the act itself is still a violation. The other person had a valid reason (interview) which adds context to her frustration. So, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
