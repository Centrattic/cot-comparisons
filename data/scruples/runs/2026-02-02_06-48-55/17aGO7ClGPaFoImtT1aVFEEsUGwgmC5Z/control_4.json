To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they ended up sleeping with their friend's girlfriend, which they both agreed was a mistake. The key points here are consent and context.\n\nFirst, both parties are consenting adults. The woman's girlfriend was there, and they made the choice to sleep together. The user mentions that they ended the encounter when they realized what was happening. However, the main issue is the relationship aspect. The user is friends with the guy, and this situation could have severe consequences for their friendship and their friend's relationship.\n\nBut legally and ethically, if both people agreed to the act, then technically there's no crime committed. However, morally, it's a different story. The user is aware of the potential harm to their friend and hasn't told him, which adds to the complexity. The act of sleeping with a friend's partner, even if both are drunk and it's a one-time thing, is generally considered wrong in social contexts because it breaches trust and can cause significant emotional damage. \n\nEven though there's no coercion mentioned, the fact that it happened during a vulnerable moment when they were both intoxicated might affect the clarity of consent. But the user's own guilt and the aftermath show they recognize the wrongdoing. So, while the act itself might not be illegal, socially and morally, the person is in the wrong because of the impact on their friend's relationship and the betrayal of trust.\n"
