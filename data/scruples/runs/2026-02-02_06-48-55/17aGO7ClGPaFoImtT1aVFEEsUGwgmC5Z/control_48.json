To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex, but I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author and his friend have been close since their teenage years. The friend's girlfriend has been with him for five years. The author has always considered himself loyal and has kept his friends' partners off-limits. However, one night after getting very drunk, the author ends up having sex with his friend's girlfriend. He doesn't remember how it happened but says he panicked, stopped, and went to sleep. The next day, she tells him he made the first move and they agree to keep it secret. Now, years later, he's still struggling with guilt and hasn't told his friend.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, sleeping with a friend's girlfriend is generally considered a betrayal. Even if it happened under the influence, the author is responsible for his actions. The fact that he didn't remember the events doesn't absolve him; it's still a violation of trust. Also, the girlfriend's consent is a factor here. The story says she didn't stop him, but it's important to note that consent under the influence is a gray area. If she was also drunk, that could complicate things legally and morally, but the story doesn't mention that.\n\nAnother angle is the aftermath. The author hasn't come clean to his friend, which adds to the betrayal. Keeping a secret like that can damage the friendship and the friend's relationship. The author's claim that he couldn't tell his friend because it would \"kill him\" is a weak excuse. It's his responsibility to face the consequences rather than let the friend continue to be unaware.\n\nAlso, the author's own admission of guilt and the lasting effect it's had on him show that he recognizes the wrongdoing, even if he's not taking full accountability. The fact that he avoided any flirting before suggests he knew the boundaries but crossed them.\n\nSo putting it all together, even if the circumstances were under the influence, the author's actions were a betrayal of his friend's trust and his girlfriend's relationship. He's in the wrong regardless of the context. The answer should be A.\n"
