To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The situation is that the friend and his girlfriend have been together for five years, and there's no history of flirting. The author usually considers himself loyal, but this time he ended up in a situation where he had sex with the girlfriend after a night of heavy drinking. He doesn't remember the drive home but remembers waking up having had sex. He's been struggling with guilt for years and hasn't told his friend.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and knowledge. The author says that the girlfriend told him she made the first move. So, based on his account, both parties consented. However, there's a problem with context. The girlfriend is in a committed relationship, and the author is aware of that. Even if there was consent, the act of sleeping with a friend's girlfriend is generally considered a betrayal, regardless of who initiated it. The fact that they were both drunk also complicates things because it might affect their ability to give full consent, but the author's memory cuts out, so maybe he can't confirm the exact circumstances of consent.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility each person has. The author, knowing the girlfriend is in a relationship, should avoid situations that could lead to such an encounter. The fact that he was in a setting where the girlfriend had to pick them up and they were all drunk might contribute to the situation, but he still has responsibility here. The girlfriend might also have her own part in the situation, but the question is about the author.\n\nThe author hasn't told his friend, which adds to the guilt and the secrecy. Even if both parties consented, the act is still a betrayal from the author's side because he's the one who's the friend of the boyfriend. The argument that he didn't mean to and was drunk doesn't excuse it. The main issue is the violation of trust and the potential harm to the friendship and the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong because he engaged in a relationship with someone who is in a committed relationship with his friend, regardless of consent. The secrecy and the impact on the friendships and the relationships are significant. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
