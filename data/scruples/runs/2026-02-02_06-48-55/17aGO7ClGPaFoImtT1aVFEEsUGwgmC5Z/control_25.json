To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The story mentions that they were both drunk and that the author's memory of the drive home is missing. The next morning, he remembers having sex with the girlfriend, panics, and decides not to tell his friend to protect him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his friend have been close for years, and the friend's girlfriend has never been flirted with by the author before. The situation happened when they were both very drunk, and the author's memory is a bit hazy. The girlfriend claims he made the first move, but the author doesn't remember it. He's been struggling with guilt for years and hasn't told his friend yet.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). From an ethical standpoint, even if the author didn't consciously plan it, the act of engaging in a sexual relationship with his friend's partner is a betrayal of trust. The fact that they were drunk might be a factor, but intoxication doesn't negate responsibility. The author's decision to not tell his friend is also problematic because it's keeping a secret that could harm the friend's relationship if discovered otherwise.\n\nBut wait, the author says he ended the encounter and hasn't told his friend, showing remorse. However, the main issue is the act itself. Even if it was a one-time mistake under the influence, it's still a violation of their friendship and the trust between them. The girlfriend's statement that they can't tell anyone might be her way of handling the situation, but that doesn't make it right. The author is in a position where he needs to be honest with his friend, even if it's hard. Not doing so might prevent the friend from knowing the truth and dealing with it, which could be worse in the long run.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that he's being loyal by not telling his friend is a bit contradictory. True loyalty might involve honesty, even when it's painful. However, the author might fear losing the friendship or causing more harm. But regardless, the act of cheating is typically seen as wrong. The fact that there's no indication of the girlfriend initiating it beyond her statement complicates things a bit, but the author's own memory cutting out suggests he might have been in a state where consent was questionable. Even if she consented, it's still an affair. \n\nIn most moral frameworks, having a sexual relationship with someone's partner without their knowledge is considered a significant transgression. The author's continued silence and guilt over years show he knows it's wrong, which reinforces that. So the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
