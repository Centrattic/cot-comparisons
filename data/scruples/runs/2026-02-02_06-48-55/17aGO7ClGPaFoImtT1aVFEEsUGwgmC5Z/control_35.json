To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The situation is that they both ended up at the author's place after getting drunk, and the next thing he remembers is having sex with the girlfriend. The author says he panicked and stopped, but hasn't told his friend. Now he's struggling with guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a situation where he's had a sexual relationship with his friend's girlfriend. Even if he didn't intend to, the act itself is a betrayal. The fact that he remembers panicking but didn't stop the situation entirely might be an issue. Also, the author hasn't told his friend, which adds to the problem because honesty is important in friendships and relationships.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA). The options are A for yes, he's in the wrong, and B for no. The answer should be A because regardless of consent or intoxication, having a sexual relationship with a friend's partner is a violation of trust and boundaries. Even if both parties were drunk, consent under such circumstances can be questionable, but the main issue here is the breach of loyalty and the impact on the friend's relationship. The author's decision to keep it a secret instead of coming clean also compounds the problem. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
