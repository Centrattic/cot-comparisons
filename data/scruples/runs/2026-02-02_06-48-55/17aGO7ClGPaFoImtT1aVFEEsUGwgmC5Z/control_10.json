To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The situation is that they got drunk, and the author's memory is fuzzy. He says he panicked when he realized what was happening and stopped, but the girlfriend said he made the first move. The author hasn't told his friend yet.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author admits it was a mistake. He considered himself loyal before, but this broke that. The main issue is consent and the circumstances. Even if he was drunk, that doesn't excuse the action. The fact that he didn't remember the event but still ended up in a sexual situation with his friend's girlfriend complicates things. The girlfriend's account is that he initiated, which implies he might have made a choice, even if under the influence. However, if he was too intoxicated to consent properly, that's another angle. But since he ended up engaging in the act, regardless of memory, he's responsible. Also, not telling his friend is a betrayal of trust. So the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong. The key is that he's the one who had the affair, and that's a clear breach of trust, regardless of alcohol.\n"
