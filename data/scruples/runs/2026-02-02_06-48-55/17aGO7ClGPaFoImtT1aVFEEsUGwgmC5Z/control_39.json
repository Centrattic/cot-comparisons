To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The question is whether the answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend who's been in a 5-year relationship. The author has always been loyal and avoided any friends' romantic interests. But one night, after getting drunk, the author ended up having sex with his friend's girlfriend. He passed out, and when he woke up, the girlfriend said he made the first move and they agreed to keep it secret. He hasn't told his friend yet and is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had sex with his friend's girlfriend without consent, or at least, there's ambiguity. Wait, the girlfriend says he made the first move, but if they were both drunk, can consent be given? In many places, consent cannot be given if someone is intoxicated. So even if the girlfriend consented in the moment, if she was drunk, that might not count legally or ethically.\n\nAlso, the author is keeping it a secret from his friend, which is another layer of betrayal. Even if the act was consensual in the moment, it's still a serious breach of trust in the friendship and towards the friend's relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that he panicked and ended it once he realized what was happening. But he doesn't take responsibility for his actions. He's been struggling with guilt for years but hasn't come clean. That shows a lack of accountability.\n\nSo, ethically, regardless of consent (which might be questionable due to intoxication), the act itself violates the friend's trust and the girlfriend's boundaries. The author's decision not to tell his friend adds to the wrongdoing. Even if the girlfriend consented, it's still an issue because the friend has the right to know if his partner was unfaithful. The author is caught in a cycle of guilt and secrecy, which makes him complicit in the harm caused.\n\nIn most moral frameworks, this would be considered a serious mistake. The author's actions have caused lasting damage to the friendship and the relationship, and he hasn't taken steps to address it. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
