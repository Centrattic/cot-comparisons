To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The situation involves a lot of factors. First, the author mentions that he and his friend have been close for years, and the friend's girlfriend is off-limits. But during a night of heavy drinking, the author ends up having sex with the girlfriend. He panics and doesn't tell his friend.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. From a moral standpoint, sleeping with someone's partner is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust and violates the relationship's boundaries. The author knew the girlfriend was off-limits, so even if it was a one-time mistake, it's still a violation. The fact that he didn't tell his friend adds another layer of betrayal. Even though he feels guilty and hasn't told the friend, the act itself was wrong regardless of the circumstances. The alcohol might have impaired his judgment, but he's still responsible for his actions. So, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
