To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author slept with their friend's girlfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author mentions that they considered themselves very loyal to their friend. They and the friend have been close for years, and the friend's girlfriend has been in the relationship for five years. The incident happened after they got drunk, and the author's memory is fuzzy. The next thing they remember is having sex with the girlfriend. They panicked, stopped, and didn't tell their friend. Now, they're struggling with guilt and haven't confessed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are consent and the circumstances. The author says they initiated the act, but the girlfriend says they made the first move. Wait, does that mean both made a move? Wait, no\u2014the friend's girlfriend told the author that he made the first move. So, the author didn't force her; she might have been willing. But even if both were willing, the issue is that they're in a committed relationship. The author is in a position of trust with their friend, and sleeping with a friend's partner is a betrayal regardless of consent. \n\nAnother point is that the author didn't act on any prior interest. They mention that they've always avoided even flirting with their friends' partners. So this was a lapse in judgment. Also, the friend's girlfriend had a car, so she came to pick them up. Maybe they were in a situation where they were alone, tipsy, and things escalated. But the author's responsibility is to respect their friend's relationship regardless of the circumstances. \n\nThe author hasn't told their friend, out of fear of hurting them. But is that a valid reason not to come clean? The friend has a right to know if their partner was unfaithful. Also, the author is feeling guilty, which suggests they recognize the wrongness of their actions. \n\nSo, even if both parties consented, the act itself is a betrayal of the friend's trust. The author's loyalty to the friend was compromised. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
