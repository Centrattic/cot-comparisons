To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for sleeping with their friend's girlfriend. The situation is that they were drunk, got picked up by the friend's girlfriend, and then ended up having sex. The next day, they panicked and didn't tell their friend. Now, even after a few years, they feel guilty.\n\nHmm, so first, consent is important. The story says that the girlfriend says the author made the first move and that they agreed never to tell anyone. But even if both people consented, it's still an issue because it's an affair. The author's friend has a right to know, especially since it's his partner. But the author is keeping it a secret, which is a problem.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they were drunk. If they were really too drunk to remember, maybe their consent isn't valid. But the girlfriend says they made the first move, so maybe she wasn't drunk? Or maybe both were. But even if both were consenting, the fact remains that it's a betrayal of the friend's trust. The friend's girlfriend isn't the author's to engage with romantically if they both are friends.\n\nThe author's loyalty as a friend is supposed to keep them from being with the friend's partner. The fact that they broke that unspoken rule makes them at fault. Even if they didn't mean to, the act itself is wrong. Not telling the friend adds to the wrongdoing because it's hiding the truth, which could hurt the friend more in the long run.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they engaged in a relationship that violates their friend's trust and kept it a secret, which is harmful.\n"
