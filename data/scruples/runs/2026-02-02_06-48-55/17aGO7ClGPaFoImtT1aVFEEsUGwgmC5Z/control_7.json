To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author says that he's always been a loyal friend, especially to this guy who's been his close friend for a long time. The couple has been together for five years without any previous hints of flirting. The incident happened after they got really drunk, and the friend's girlfriend came to pick them up. The author's memory is blurry, but he woke up having had sex with her. He panicked, stopped, and went to sleep. The next day she said he made the first move and they agreed to keep it secret. He hasn't told his friend yet and feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are consent, intoxication, and the context. The author mentions that they were both drunk. If someone is incapacitated due to alcohol, they can't legally or ethically consent. Even if the woman claimed he made the first move, if she was also drunk, that might affect her ability to consent. \n\nHowever, the author's own account suggests that he might have been in a state where he couldn't make rational decisions. But the issue is that both parties were under the influence. The question is whether the author is still responsible. \n\nIn many ethical and legal frameworks, consent must be given by sober individuals. If either party is too drunk to consent, then any sexual activity is non-consensual. So if the author was drunk, but the woman was also drunk, both might have been unable to consent. However, the author is the one who initiated it once he realized what was happening. \n\nThe fact that they agreed to keep it a secret and the author hasn't told his friend yet shows he feels guilty. But the main issue is whether the act itself was wrong regardless of their intentions. Even if it was a mistake under the influence, the author still had a sexual relationship with his friend's girlfriend. \n\nAdditionally, the author's loyalty to his friend is mentioned, but that doesn't excuse the action. The act itself is problematic because it's a betrayal of trust and potentially non-consensual due to intoxication. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. He's responsible for his actions, even if they occurred under the influence. The consent might have been invalid due to both being too drunk, making it a violation. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
