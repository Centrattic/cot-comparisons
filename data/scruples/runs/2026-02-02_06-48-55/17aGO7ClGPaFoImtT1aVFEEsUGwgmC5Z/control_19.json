To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The situation is that the author and his friend have been close for years. The friend's girlfriend came to pick them up after they were too drunk, and the next thing he remembers is having sex with her. He says he panicked and ended it, and they both agreed to keep it secret. Now he's struggling with it and hasn't told his friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The key points here are consent, intoxication, and the relationship dynamics. The author mentions that he got very drunk, and his memory cuts out during the drive home. That raises questions about whether both parties were capable of giving clear consent. If he was too drunk to remember what happened, that could imply that he wasn't in a state to make informed decisions, which is a problem. Also, the friend's girlfriend went along to collect them, which might mean she was in a similar state. \n\nThen there's the aspect of friendship. The author claims to be a loyal friend, but this action would deeply hurt his friend. The fact that he hasn't told his friend yet, even after a few years, suggests he knows it's a betrayal. Even if there was some level of mutual agreement in the heat of the moment, the aftermath involves hiding the truth, which complicates things. \n\nAnother angle is the initial context: the friend's girlfriend was their only friend with a car. That might mean she was in a situation where she had to intervene, but that doesn't excuse the author's actions. The fact that there was no prior flirting mentioned is a point, but absence of flirting doesn't mean there wasn't an opportunity for something to happen under the influence. \n\nConsent is a critical factor here. If both were too intoxicated to give proper consent, then the act itself could be non-consensual. Even if one party initiated it, if they were both impaired, that's a problem. Additionally, the guilt he feels afterward and the fact that he's kept it a secret indicate he recognizes it as a mistake. \n\nSo putting it all together: The author made a poor decision under the influence, likely without clear consent. He's aware it's wrong, but hasn't taken responsibility by telling his friend. Even if there was mutual action at the time, the betrayal of trust is significant. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
