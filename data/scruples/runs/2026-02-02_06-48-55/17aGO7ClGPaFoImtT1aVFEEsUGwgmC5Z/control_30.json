To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they slept with their friend's girlfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend and his girlfriend have been together for five years. The author claims there was no prior flirting or interest. They consider themselves loyal, but this incident happened after a night of heavy drinking. The friend's girlfriend came to pick them up because they were too drunk. The author's memory is fuzzy, but they remember ending the encounter and keeping it a secret. Now, they're still struggling with guilt and haven't told their friend.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author had a consensual relationship with their friend's girlfriend. The issue is whether this makes them the asshole. \n\nI need to consider if consent matters. Even if both parties agreed, it's still a betrayal of trust towards the friend. The friend's girlfriend isn't the one wronged here in terms of the friendship. The author's friend is the one who's been deceived. Also, the author didn't confront their friend, which adds to the problem. \n\nEven if it was a one-time thing and both parties were drunk, the key point is that the author engaged in a relationship that they knew could hurt their friend. The secrecy and lack of accountability are also factors. The author's own admission of feeling guilty and the impact on their friendship suggest they're in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they betrayed their friend's trust and didn't take responsibility.\n"
