To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had sex with their friend's girlfriend. The question is whether they are the asshole here, and the options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author and the friend have been close for years, and the friend's girlfriend has always been off-limits. The incident happened after they got very drunk. The author's memory is fuzzy, but they ended up having sex. The next day, they panicked and stopped, and the girlfriend said they can't tell anyone. The author hasn't told the friend yet and feels guilty.\n\nSo, the main points: The author had consensual sex with someone who was in a committed relationship (the friend's girlfriend). Even if both parties agreed, the act itself is a violation of trust and the friend's relationship. The author's role here is that they engaged in this without the friend's knowledge or consent. \n\nEven if the author got drunk, that doesn't excuse the action. Responsibility still lies with them because they made a choice, even if they were intoxicated. The fact that they haven't told their friend shows they know it's wrong, which makes them complicit in the lie. \n\nEthically, cheating on a friend is a betrayal of trust. The author admits they've always considered themselves loyal, but this action contradicts that. The girlfriend's consent doesn't make it okay in the context of an existing relationship. So the author is definitely in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
