To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they had sex with their friend's girlfriend without their friend knowing. Let me consider the key points here.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've always been loyal to their friend, avoiding any interest in their friends' partners. But in this case, they ended up sleeping with the girlfriend. The context says they were drunk, memory faded, and the next thing they remember is having sex. They panicked and ended it but never told their friend. They feel guilty and haven't confessed.\n\nNow, even if alcohol was involved, consent is a big factor here. The story says the girlfriend claims the author made the first move. However, the main issue is that the author was involved in a relationship with someone their best friend was dating. That's a betrayal of trust, regardless of consent. The friend's girlfriend is off-limits, and crossing that line is a violation of their friendship. \n\nEven though the author didn't mean to, the act itself is wrong. The fact that they haven't told their friend and are still haunted by guilt suggests they know it's a serious mistake. The friend's trust has been broken, and the author is hiding the truth, which adds to the wrongness. \n\nSo, regardless of the circumstances like being drunk or the girlfriend's response, the act of sleeping with a friend's partner is a betrayal. The author is in the wrong because they violated a key boundary in their friendship. The answer should be A.\n"
