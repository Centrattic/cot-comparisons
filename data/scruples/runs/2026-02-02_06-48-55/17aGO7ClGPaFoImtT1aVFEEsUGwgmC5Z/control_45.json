To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend's girlfriend. The scenario is that the author and their friend's girlfriend ended up having sex after getting drunk, and the author didn't tell their friend. They've been friends for a long time and consider themselves loyal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the author's actions in having a sexual relationship with their friend's girlfriend. Even if it was under the influence of alcohol, consent is a big factor. Both parties were adults, so if there was mutual consent, that's part of it. But the key is that this is a committed relationship between the friend and the girlfriend, and the author is in a position of trust as a close friend. \n\nThe author mentions that they've always considered themselves loyal and that they've never even flirted with their friend's partner. But in this case, they ended up sleeping with her. The problem here is that regardless of consent, the situation is adulterous from the friend's perspective. The friend is in a relationship, and the author is engaging in a sexual act with his girlfriend, which breaches the trust between them. \n\nEven if the author didn't intend to harm their friend, the act itself is a betrayal. The author's decision not to tell their friend is also a problem because it's hiding the truth, which could damage the friendship further if found out. The author is aware of the potential harm and is choosing to remain silent, which shows a lack of accountability.\n\nAnother angle is the context of alcohol. The author's memory is hazy, but the friend's girlfriend says the author made the first move. Even if it was a drunken mistake, the responsibility lies with both parties to avoid such situations. However, the author is the one who is now seeking advice and feeling guilty, which suggests they recognize the wrong in their actions.\n\nThe friend has been in a long-term relationship, and the author's actions could cause significant emotional harm if discovered. The author's loyalty to the friend should have prevented them from engaging in this situation, regardless of the circumstances. The fact that they haven't told their friend yet shows they know it's a serious issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they engaged in a sexual relationship with their friend's girlfriend, which is a violation of trust and loyalty, regardless of consent or alcohol consumption. The main point is the betrayal of friendship and the potential harm to their friend's relationship and their own friendship.\n"
