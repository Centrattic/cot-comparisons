To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The situation is that they ended up in a situation where they both got drunk, and the author ended up having sex with the girlfriend. The author didn't tell his friend and still feels guilty.\n\nFirst, the basics: the woman is in a committed relationship with the author's best friend. There's no mention of consent beyond the act itself, but given the context of both being drunk, maybe that's a point. But the key issue here is the relationship dynamics. The author's friend has a girlfriend, and the author's actions directly betray that friend's trust. \n\nEven if the author claims he panicked and stopped, the fact that he didn't tell his friend is a problem. The friend might feel hurt and betrayed upon finding out. The author's silence suggests he's aware of the wrongness of his actions. Also, the fact that they agreed to keep it a secret implies that both knew it was a mistake. \n\nThe argument for AITA (A for Yes) is that the author was in a position of trust with both his friend and his girlfriend. Even if it was a one-time thing, it's a betrayal of that trust. The fact that he hasn't told his friend shows he's avoiding confronting the consequences, which adds to the wrongdoing. \n\nOn the flip side, if the girlfriend initiated it, but the story says the author made the first move according to her. But regardless, the author still chose to engage in the act. Drunk doesn't excuse it because both parties were intoxicated. Consent under the influence is not valid in most contexts. So even if it happened during a blackout, the author is still responsible for his actions, especially since he later felt guilty. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he had a close friendship with his friend, knew the girlfriend was off-limits, and his actions breached that trust. The secrecy and guilt further confirm he's aware it's wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
