To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves having sex with a friend's girlfriend, but it happened after a night of heavy drinking where the author's memory is fuzzy. The key points here are consent and agency.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the next day the girlfriend told him he made the first move. But since the author's memory is cut off during the drive home, there's ambiguity about what actually happened. However, the fact that they ended up having sex when the author panicked and stopped suggests that they might have been in a vulnerable state. But even if the author was drunk, that doesn't excuse the action. Consent is a big factor here. If the girlfriend was also under the influence, her ability to give clear consent might be compromised. However, the story says the girlfriend didn't show any previous interest, and they were supposed to be off-limits. \n\nWait, the author claims they consider themselves loyal and have always kept friends' partners off-limits. But in this case, they ended up sleeping with the friend's girlfriend. The author didn't take responsibility and hasn't told the friend. The author is struggling with guilt but hasn't come clean. \n\nEven if the author was drunk, the responsibility isn't entirely on the other person. If the girlfriend was also drunk, then it could be a mutual issue, but the author still made the choice to engage in that situation. Plus, the fact that they both agreed to keep it secret implies that they both know it's wrong. The author's inaction in telling the friend is also a problem because it's dishonest. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they violated their friend's trust, the girlfriend's trust, and their own principles. The fact that it happened under the influence doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The answer is A."
