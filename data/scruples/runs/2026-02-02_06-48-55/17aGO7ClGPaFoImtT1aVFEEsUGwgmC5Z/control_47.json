To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for sleeping with their friend's girlfriend. The situation is that they were drunk, their friend's girlfriend picked them up, and after memory loss, they ended up having sex. The key points here are consent and context.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the friend's girlfriend was the one who called to take them home. The next day, she told him he made the first move. So, if he was too drunk to consent properly, that's a problem. But if she initiated it and he was conscious enough to participate, that's a different angle. However, his memory cuts out, which complicates things. \n\nThe fact that he ended the encounter when he realized what was happening shows some level of regret, but the act itself is a betrayal. Even if he wasn't entirely in his right mind, the responsibility still lies with him. The girlfriend might have taken advantage of his state, but the author's actions were still wrong. \n\nAlso, the author hasn't told their friend, which adds to the guilt. Keeping it a secret means he's complicit in the deception. The fact that they've known each other for years and considered themselves loyal friends makes the betrayal more severe. \n\nEven if there's some ambiguity in consent due to intoxication, the author's actions crossed a clear boundary. The friend's girlfriend wasn't even involved in the initial situation, so there's no justification. The answer here is likely A, as the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend regardless of the circumstances.\n"
