To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author did something wrong by sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. So first, I need to look at the details provided.\n\nThe author mentions that he and his friend have been close for a long time, and the friend's girlfriend has always been off-limits. But one night, after getting drunk, he ends up having sex with her. His memory cuts out during the drive home, and he later says he panicked when it happened. The girlfriend told him he made the first move and they agreed never to tell anyone. Now, years later, the author is struggling with guilt and hasn't told his friend.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, sleeping with a friend's girlfriend is generally seen as a betrayal. Even if it happened under the influence, the key issue is that both the author and the girlfriend engaged in the act. The author's argument might be that he didn't mean for it to happen and was drunk, but consent and responsibility are still factors here. The girlfriend also made the first move according to her, but that doesn't absolve the author. Both parties are involved here. \n\nThe author hasn't told his friend, which adds to the problem. Keeping such a secret, especially when it's hurting someone else, is part of the wrongdoing. Even if the author is struggling with guilt, he hasn't taken responsibility by informing his friend. So, ethically, he's in the wrong for both participating in the affair and not being honest with his friend.\n\nIn most moral frameworks, this is considered a breach of trust and friendship. The fact that it was a one-time incident doesn't change that. The consequences are still there, and the author is complicit in maintaining the lie, which harms his friend. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
