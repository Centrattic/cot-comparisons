To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The scenario is that the author and his friend have been close for years, and the friend's girlfriend is involved. The key points here are consent and the circumstances.\n\nThe author mentions that they were both drunk. He says his memory cuts out during the drive home, and the next thing he remembers is having sex with the girlfriend. The girlfriend says he made the first move and they can't tell anyone. Now, even if both were drunk, consent is a big issue here. If either party was too intoxicated to give clear consent, then it's a problem. But the story isn't entirely clear on whether the girlfriend was also willing or if she was just in a similar state.\n\nAnother point is the relationship dynamics. The author's friend has been with the girlfriend for five years, and there's no history of any flirting. The author considers himself loyal, but this action goes against that. Even if it was a one-time mistake, the fact that the author hasn't told his friend yet shows guilt and possible fear of consequences. \n\nThe girlfriend's statement that they can't tell anyone adds complexity. If she's complicit but wants to keep it secret, that might not absolve the author. The main issue is whether the act was consensual under the circumstances. If one or both were too drunk to consent, then it's a violation. If they were both consenting but it's a betrayal of trust, then the author is still in the wrong because he's cheating on his friend, which is a serious breach.\n\nAlso, the author's own feelings of guilt and the fact that he's been struggling with it for years indicate he knows it's wrong. So even if there were mutual consent in that moment, the act itself is unethical and harmful to both his friend and the girlfriend. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he engaged in a sexual relationship with his friend's partner, regardless of the drunkenness. The key factors here are betrayal of trust and the potential lack of valid consent due to intoxication. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
