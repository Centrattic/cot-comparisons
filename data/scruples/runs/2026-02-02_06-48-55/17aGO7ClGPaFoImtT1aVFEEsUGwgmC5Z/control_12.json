To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The scenario is that they got drunk, the friend's girlfriend picked them up, and the next thing he remembers is having sex with her. The author says he panicked, ended it, and hasn't told his friend. He's struggling with guilt.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is consent. If both parties agreed to the sexual activity, then technically, there wasn't a crime, but ethically, it's still a huge problem. However, the main question is about morality and being the \"asshole.\"\n\nThe author claims he's a loyal friend, but this action is a betrayal of trust. Even if alcohol was involved, the responsibility lies with him. The fact that his friend's girlfriend was there to pick them up and then ended up in a situation like that suggests possible manipulation or taking advantage of her state. Also, the author says he can't tell his friend, which adds to the betrayal because it's hiding a major transgression from someone who considers himself loyal.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's girlfriend's role. If she also consented, it complicates things, but the main issue is the relationship dynamics. Sleeping with a friend's girlfriend, regardless of consent, is a violation of the friend's trust and the social norms around relationships. Even if both were drunk, the author still made a choice to engage in that act. The fact that he felt guilty afterward indicates he knows it's wrong.\n\nThe community might argue that the author is in the wrong because he broke trust and betrayed his friend. The fact that he hasn't told his friend shows he's aware of the severity. So, answer A (Yes) makes sense here.\n"
