To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of a \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The scenario is that the author and his friend have been close for years, and the friend's girlfriend was always off-limits. One night after getting drunk, the author ends up having sex with the girlfriend. He panics and doesn't tell his friend, and now he's struggling with guilt.\n\nFirst, the basic premise is that the author is in a situation where he's had consensual sex with someone who is in a committed relationship. The key here is that the girlfriend was in a relationship, so the act of having sex with her without her partner's knowledge or consent is a violation of their relationship. Even if both parties were drunk, if there was no coercion and both agreed, it's still consensual by their own admission. However, the fact remains that the author is in a position where he's betraying the trust of his friend, which is a significant ethical issue regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe argument for the author being in the wrong (Option A) is that he engaged in a sexual relationship with his friend's partner without considering the consequences. This is a breach of trust and friendship. Even if it happened under the influence, the responsibility still falls on both parties involved. The author's decision not to tell his friend and to keep it a secret exacerbates the problem because it hides the betrayal from the friend who was directly affected.\n\nOn the other hand, if we consider Option B (not in the wrong), one might argue that the girlfriend was also complicit and made the first move as per her account. However, this line of thinking overlooks the fact that the author is still complicit in the act. The relationship dynamics here are complex, but the act itself is a violation of the friend's trust. The author's loyalty to his friend is supposed to be paramount, and this action undermines that. \n\nMoreover, the author mentions he's been feeling guilty for years, which indicates he recognizes the wrongness of his actions. His decision not to disclose this to his friend shows a lack of accountability and further perpetuates the harm. Even if the situation was a mutual decision between him and the girlfriend, the impact on the friend is undeniable. \n\nIn societal and ethical standards, engaging in a sexual relationship with someone's partner without the partner's knowledge is generally considered a betrayal. Therefore, the author is in the wrong regardless of the circumstances. The answer should be A.\n"
