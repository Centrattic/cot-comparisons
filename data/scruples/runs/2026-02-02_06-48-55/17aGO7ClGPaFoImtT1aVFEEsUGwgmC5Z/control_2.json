To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The scenario is that they were drunk, driven home by the girlfriend, and then the author ended up having sex with her. He didn't tell his friend and feels guilty.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether the author is at fault. The key points are consent and the circumstances. If the girlfriend was okay with it, then technically, it's consensual. But the bigger problem is that it's with a friend's partner. Even if there was consent, the act itself is a betrayal of the friend's trust. \n\nThe author mentions that he's known for being loyal and that he's never considered other friends' partners. This makes the situation worse because he's breaking a self-imposed rule and betraying his friend. The fact that he can't tell his friend shows he knows it's wrong. \n\nBut wait, were they both intoxicated? The drive home memory is cut out, so maybe one or both were too drunk to consent properly. The line for consent when someone is drunk is blurry. If both were drunk but not too impaired, it's still consensual, but the act itself is still a betrayal. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction: she says he made the first move, but that doesn't absolve him. He's still in a position where he's involved with his friend's significant other. Even if it's mutual, it's still an affair. \n\nThe author's guilt and inability to tell his friend indicate he feels wrong about it. So, from a moral standpoint, even if legally it's consensual, ethically he's in the wrong because of the betrayal and the impact on his friend.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
