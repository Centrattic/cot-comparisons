To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The situation is that they both got drunk, the friend's girlfriend was called to pick them up, and the next thing the author remembers is having sex with her. He panicked and stopped, then they agreed never to tell anyone. He hasn't told his friend yet and feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is a case of consent. The friend's girlfriend says the author made the first move. But since the author's memory is a blur, he might not remember if she was also consenting. However, the story doesn't mention her being drunk or incapable. If she didn't object and engaged in the act, it could be mutual, but the author's panic and the fact that it happened in a vulnerable state (drunk) complicates things.\n\nEven if it was consensual, the author is in a morally wrong position because the girl is his friend's partner. He knew the rules all his life\u2014friends' partners were off-limits. Breaking that trust is a betrayal, regardless of consent. Plus, the fact that he hasn't told his friend yet suggests he's aware of the potential harm. Even if there's no legal wrongdoing, socially and ethically, he's violated a trust bond. The key here is the violation of the trust and the potential damage to his friendship and the friend's relationship. So yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
