To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the key points: the author had a close friend for years, their friend's girlfriend was always off-limits. One night, after getting drunk and needing a ride, the friend's girlfriend picks them up. The author's memory cuts out during the drive home, and the next thing he remembers is having sex with the girlfriend. He panics, stops, and they both agree to never tell anyone. Now, he's struggling with guilt for years.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about morality and social norms. In most ethical frameworks, betraying a friend's trust by sleeping with their partner is considered wrong. Even if there's alcohol involved, which might impair judgment, the act itself is still a violation of the friend's trust and the girlfriend's relationship. \n\nThe author mentions that he's been unable to tell his friend, which adds to the guilt. The fact that he feels physically sick about it suggests he knows it's wrong. Also, the girlfriend initiated the move, but that doesn't absolve him. Consent isn't the main issue here; it's the breach of trust. Both parties made a decision not to tell anyone, but that doesn't make the act right. The author's loyalty to his friend is supposed to be a key part of his identity, yet he broke that trust. \n\nEven if there's some ambiguity due to alcohol, the consequences of the action are clear. The friend's trust is broken, and the author is living with the guilt. In most social contexts, this would be considered a clear breach of ethics. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
