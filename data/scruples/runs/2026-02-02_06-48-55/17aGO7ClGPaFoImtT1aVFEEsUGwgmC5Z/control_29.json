To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with their friend's girlfriend. The situation is described as something that happened during a drunk night where the author's memory is hazy. The key points here are consent, the state of intoxication, and the author's actions afterward.\n\nFirst, the author says they were \"twisted drunk,\" which might imply they were very intoxicated. If they were too drunk to make informed decisions, that could affect consent. But the other person, the girlfriend, is part of the scenario too. The author mentions that the girlfriend says he made the first move, but if he was too drunk, could he have given valid consent? Wait, actually, the girlfriend is the one who came to collect them, so maybe she was also involved in the situation. However, if the author was so intoxicated that he couldn't consent, then even if the girlfriend wanted to, it might be a violation. \n\nBut the problem is that the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author says they panicked when they realized what was happening, which suggests that maybe they didn't realize during the act. But even if they were drunk, if they initiated or participated in the act, there's a moral issue here. The author also hasn't told their friend, which adds to the guilt. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend's partner without their knowledge is considered wrong, especially if it's a betrayal of trust. Even if it was a one-time incident under the influence, the author still made a choice, even if impaired, that harmed their friend's relationship. Plus, there's the aspect of consent. If the author was too drunk to consent, then the act might be considered non-consensual, making the author a victim, but if the author was\u6e05\u9192 enough to participate, then it's their fault.\n\nBut the author's memory is cut out during the drive home, so if they don't remember, can they be blamed? However, even if they don't remember, they still had the opportunity to engage in the act, and the girlfriend claims he made the first move. So it's possible that while drunk, he did initiate it, but the key is whether he was incapacitated. \n\nIn many places, if someone is too drunk to consent, any sexual activity is considered assault. But the legal aspect isn't the focus here; the user is asking if the author is in the wrong morally. Even if legally it's a gray area, morally, sleeping with a friend's girlfriend is a major betrayal. The author's own feelings of guilt and the ongoing impact on the friendship suggest that they are in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
