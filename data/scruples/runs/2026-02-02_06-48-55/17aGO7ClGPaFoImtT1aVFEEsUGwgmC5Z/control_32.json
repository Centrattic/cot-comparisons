To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for sleeping with their friend's girlfriend. The key points here are that the couple has been together for five years, there was no prior flirting or indication of interest. The incident happened after a night of heavy drinking where the friend's girlfriend came to pick them up and the memory is missing. The author panicked, stopped the act, and hasn't told their friend. They feel guilty and it's been a couple of years, but they can't bring themselves to confess.\n\nFirst, let's consider the basic premise. The person had a sexual relationship with their friend's girlfriend. Even if it's a one-time thing, that's a clear violation of the friend's trust and the girlfriend's boundaries. The fact that they were asleep and then suddenly found themselves in that situation might complicate things, but it doesn't absolve them of responsibility. They panicked and stopped, but the act still occurred.\n\nNow, the author mentions they were very drunk. But intoxication isn't a valid excuse for consent violations. If the author was too drunk to remember the event, they still have a responsibility to ensure that the other person was fully consenting. However, in this case, the girlfriend is saying that the author made the first move and that they can't tell anyone. So, it's possible that the author was the one who initiated the act, which makes it more about their own decision.\n\nThe author also says they've never been able to tell their friend, which shows they know it's wrong. They consider their friend extremely loyal and close, so keeping it a secret after all this time suggests they're aware of the harm done. The fact that they feel physically sick about it now indicates lasting guilt, which is a sign that they're in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend was involved. But even if she was consenting, the key issue is that it's their friend's girlfriend. So, the author is violating the trust between the friend and the girlfriend, regardless of who initiated it. The friend's trust in the author's loyalty is broken, and the author's decision to remain silent for years could be seen as selfish, prioritizing their own guilt over being honest with their friend.\n\nAlso, the author claims they consider friends' partners as \"completely off limits,\" which further emphasizes that they knew this was wrong. The fact that they broke their own rule shows a lapse in judgment. The severity of the situation is compounded by the long-term friendship and the fact that the couple was in a stable, long-term relationship.\n\nIn most ethical frameworks, this would be considered a betrayal. The author's actions have likely caused significant harm to the friend, even if they haven't been told yet. The author's hesitation to confess is another aspect where they are at fault because honesty and accountability are important in such situations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). They engaged in a sexual act with their friend's girlfriend, which is a betrayal of trust and friendship. The fact that they were drunk doesn't excuse it, and their inaction (not telling the friend) adds to the wrongdoing.\n"
