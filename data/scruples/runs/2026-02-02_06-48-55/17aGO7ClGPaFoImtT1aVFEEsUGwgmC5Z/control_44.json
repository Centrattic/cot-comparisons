To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an affair with his friend's girlfriend. The story says that after getting drunk, the author ended up sleeping with the girlfriend. He was drunk, and his memory of the events is missing. He panicked and ended it but hasn't told his friend since. Now he's struggling with guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. He's had a close relationship with his friend for years, and the girlfriend was off-limits. The situation happened when they were both drunk, and he can't remember what led to it. The key points here are consent and intent. \n\nIf both parties were intoxicated, then there's an issue because consent can't be given when someone is too drunk to make rational decisions. Even if he made the first move, if she was also drunk, that might complicate things. But the story says she ended up with him as well. However, since he can't remember the events, it's hard to determine if both were actually capable of giving consent. \n\nHe hasn't told his friend, which could be because he's scared of ruining the friendship. But keeping it a secret might be enabling the girlfriend if she's also involved. Also, the fact that he's been struggling with guilt for years shows he knows it's wrong. \n\nThe main ethical issues are betraying his friend's trust, the possible violation of consent due to intoxication, and not taking responsibility by not confronting the situation. Even if it was a one-time mistake, the act itself is a breach of trust and loyalty. \n\nSo regardless of the circumstances, sleeping with a friend's partner is generally considered wrong. The fact that both were drunk might add context, but it doesn't justify the action. Consent is a big part of this. If both were too drunk to consent, then it's even more problematic. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
