To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. So first, the scenario: the author and his friend have been close for years, and the friend's girlfriend is someone they've always kept their distance from. One night, after getting very drunk, the author ends up having sex with the girlfriend. He doesn't remember the details but remembers waking up in the middle of it and stopping. They agreed never to tell anyone.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's friend is in a relationship that's been going strong for five years. The author has a history of respecting boundaries, not flirting with his friends' partners. This situation is a clear breach of that. Even though the author says he panicked and stopped, the act itself is a violation of trust and consent. Wait, consent here is tricky. The woman says he made the first move, implying she didn't initiate. But if she agreed to have sex, then technically there was consent, but that doesn't absolve the author of wrongdoing because it's still cheating. Also, the fact that they were both drunk might affect consent. If either was too intoxicated to give clear consent, that's a problem. But the details are unclear here. The author's memory is hazy, but he does remember initiating and then stopping. \n\nEven if there was consent, the act is still an affair. The author is in a position of trust with his friend, and by sleeping with his girlfriend, he's broken that trust. The fact that they agreed to never tell anyone adds to the deceit. The author hasn't told his friend, which is another layer of betrayal. The friend has no idea, which could cause more harm later if it comes out. The author's guilt and the ongoing physical sickness he feels also suggest he knows it's wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is clear. The author is in the wrong. The act of sleeping with a friend's girlfriend, regardless of the circumstances, is a serious breach of trust and loyalty. Even if there was some level of consent, the relationship dynamics and the impact on the friend's trust make the author the asshole here. Answer A.\n"
