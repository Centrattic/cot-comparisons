To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves having sex with a friend's girlfriend without the friend knowing. \n\nFirst, the key points: The writer and their friend have been close for years. The friend's girlfriend was called to pick them up after they got too drunk. The writer's memory is fuzzy, but they ended up having sex with the girlfriend. The next day, the girlfriend said the writer made the first move, and they agreed to keep it a secret. The writer hasn't told their friend and feels guilty.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Even if the writer's memory is unclear, engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend's partner is a breach of trust. The friend's girlfriend is in a committed relationship, so any sexual activity with her without her partner's knowledge is cheating. The writer's loyalty to their friend is supposed to mean respecting their partner's boundaries. \n\nAlso, the writer's excuse that they were drunk and maybe didn't remember might not absolve them of responsibility. Consent and clear decisions are important, especially in such sensitive situations. The fact that they agreed to keep it a secret suggests they both knew it was wrong. \n\nLong-term consequences are mentioned\u2014feeling physically sick and not being able to tell their friend. This indicates the writer recognizes the wrongness of their actions. Even if they were drunk, the responsibility lies with them to avoid such situations, especially knowing the friend's history of being off-limits. \n\nSo, the answer is A: Yes, the author is in the wrong. They violated their friend's trust and engaged in a relationship that was not consensual in the context of their friend's marriage. The drunkenness doesn't excuse the action, and the secrecy confirms the wrongdoing.\n"
