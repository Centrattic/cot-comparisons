To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The scenario is that they got drunk, went to the author's place, and ended up having sex. The author claims he panicked and stopped, but they both agreed to keep it a secret. Now, the author feels guilty and hasn't told his friend.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are consent and the circumstances. The author says that his friend's girlfriend was the one who came to pick them up, and during the drive home, the author's memory cuts out. The next thing he remembers is having sex with her. He says he panicked and ended it, but the next day she told him he made the first move. \n\nWait, but if he was drunk to the point where his memory cuts out, does that mean he was incapacitated? In many places, if someone is too drunk to consent, any sexual activity is considered non-consensual. So even if the girl initially agreed, if the man was incapacitated, that's a problem. But the author mentions that he made the first move, so maybe she consented? But if he was so drunk he doesn't remember, it's hard to say if he could give legal consent. \n\nAlso, the fact that both parties agreed to keep it a secret complicates things. But the main issue is whether there was mutual consent. If he was too intoxicated to make rational decisions, then he might not have been able to consent properly. However, the girl's account says she felt he initiated it, but she's the one in the relationship. \n\nThe author is struggling with guilt and hasn't told his friend, which adds to the emotional weight. But legally and ethically, if either party was too drunk to consent, then the act could be considered non-consensual. The author is in a position where he's sleeping with his friend's girlfriend, which is a betrayal regardless of consent. \n\nSo, even if there was mutual agreement at the time, the fact that he's sleeping with his friend's girlfriend is a clear breach of trust. The author's loyalty as a friend is questioned here. Even if both were drunk, the act itself is wrong because it's another person's partner. So regardless of consent, the act is a violation of the friend's trust and the girlfriend's relationship. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
