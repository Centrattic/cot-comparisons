To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves sleeping with a friend's girlfriend, which is a classic \"Am I the asshole?\" scenario.\n\nFirst, the author acknowledges that they've had a close friendship with their friend for years. They mention that they've always considered themselves loyal and that they've respected their friends' relationships in the past. So, there's a history of boundaries being maintained, which makes the current situation more problematic because they broke that rule.\n\nThe incident happened after they got very drunk. The author's memory is hazy, but they ended up having sex with the girlfriend. Even if they panicked and stopped, the act itself is the main issue here. The fact that they had to be collected by the girlfriend and that the drive home is a blank spot suggests that they were in a vulnerable or impaired state. However, consent is a key factor. The girlfriend says the author made the first move, but even if she was also under the influence, consent under the influence can be invalid. Also, regardless of consent, sleeping with a friend's girlfriend is a breach of trust and friendship.\n\nThe author hasn't told their friend, which adds to the problem. They're keeping a secret that's causing them guilt and physical discomfort. The fact that they've struggled with this for years and still can't bring themselves to come clean shows that they know it's wrong. The consequences for the friend could be severe\u2014losing trust, potential breakup, emotional harm. The author's loyalty to the friend should have prevented this, but they failed. Even if alcohol played a role, it's not an excuse. People are responsible for their actions, especially in such a trusting relationship. So, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong.\n"
