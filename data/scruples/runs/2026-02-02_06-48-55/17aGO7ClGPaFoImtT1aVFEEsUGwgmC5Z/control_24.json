To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for sleeping with their friend's girlfriend. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe person and their friend have been close for years. The friend's girlfriend is mentioned to have been with him for five years, and there's no indication she ever flirted or anything. The user claims they're loyal and that once friends show interest in a girl, they stay away. But one night, they got really drunk with another friend, and the friend's girlfriend came to pick them up. The user's memory is fuzzy, but they ended up having sex with her. They panicked and stopped, then the next day she said he made the first move and they can't tell anyone. The user hasn't told their friend and still feels guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here: consent? Since they were drunk, does that affect consent? The user's memory is cut out, but they ended up in a situation where they had sex. The girlfriend says he made the first move. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn many places, if someone is too drunk to consent, any sexual activity without clear, sober consent could be considered non-consensual. Even if both parties were drunk, if one can't give informed consent, it's not valid. The user mentions they got \"twisted drunk\" and their memory is missing. So, even if the girlfriend initiated, if she was also drunk, her consent might not be valid. Also, the fact that they agreed to never tell anyone suggests they both knew it was wrong. The user didn't confront their friend, which adds to the guilt. \n\nSo, the user is in the wrong because they engaged in a sexual act without proper consent, especially under the influence. Even if they didn't intend to, the consequences are there. The fact that they feel guilty and haven't told their friend shows they know it's wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
