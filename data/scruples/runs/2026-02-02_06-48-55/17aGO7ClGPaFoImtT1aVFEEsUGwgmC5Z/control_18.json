To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is the asshole for sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. The situation involves the author, his friend, and the friend's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author and his friend have been close for years. The friend's girlfriend is off-limits to the author as per their unspoken rule. One night, after a heavy drinking session where the author's memory is fuzzy, he ends up having sex with the girlfriend. He panics, stops, and they agree to keep it secret. Now, years later, he's still struggling with guilt and hasn't told his friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the scenario, the author had a relationship with his friend built on trust. By sleeping with the friend's girlfriend, even if it was under the influence and he regrets it, he violated that trust. The fact that he didn't tell his friend shows he knows it was wrong. The girlfriend also mentions the author made the first move, implying consent, but that's not the main issue here. The main issue is the betrayal of friendship and the secrecy. \n\nEven if alcohol played a role, the author is responsible for his actions. The fact that he's still feeling sick about it years later indicates he recognizes his mistake. The friend's girlfriend being \"off-limits\" was a boundary he broke. So, regardless of the circumstances, the act itself is a betrayal. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
