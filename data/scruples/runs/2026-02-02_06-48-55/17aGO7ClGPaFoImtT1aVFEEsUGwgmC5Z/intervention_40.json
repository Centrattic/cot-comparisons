To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for sleeping with their friend's girlfriend. The setup is that they've been friends with their buddy for years, and there's never been any flirting between them and the girlfriend. The incident happened after they got really drunk, and the memory is fuzzy. The friend's girlfriend came to pick them up because they were too drunk to go anywhere else. Then the next thing the author remembers is having sex with her. They panicked, stopped it, and went to sleep. The next day, she said they made the first move and they agreed never to tell anyone. The author hasn't told their friend and feels guilty still.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author had sex with their friend's girlfriend without the friend's knowledge. The situation was that they were very drunk, which might affect consent or understanding of the situation. The friend's girlfriend says the author made the first move, but even if that's true, the author is still in a situation where they shouldn't be engaging in such a relationship.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, sleeping with a friend's partner is a violation of trust, not just towards the friend but also potentially the partner. Even if both the author and the girlfriend were willing, the fact that the friend is unaware means the author has betrayed their trust. The author's own statement that they've considered themselves loyal to their friend before adds weight to this betrayal.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they haven't told the friend, which suggests they know it's wrong and are hiding it. The fact that they feel physically sick and have guilt after so many years indicates that they have a moral conflict about their actions.\n\nDrunk sex is another factor. If the author was very drunk and memory was cut out, that might affect their ability to consent properly or to understand the consequences. However, even if one party is drunk, engaging in sexual activity without clear, sober consent from both parties can still be problematic. The girlfriend's account says the author made the first move, but if she was also in a compromised state (maybe she was drunk too?), that could affect the validity of the consent. However, the question is about the author's responsibility.\n\nEven assuming that both parties consented at the time, the fact remains that the author is in a relationship with the friend, and this action breaches that trust. The author's own statement that they've considered friends' partners off-limits before shows they knew the rules but broke them. So, the act itself is wrong regardless of the circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they engaged in a sexual relationship with their friend's girlfriend, which is a betrayal of trust and friendship. Even if there were mutual consent at the time, the context of being drunk and the pre-existing understanding that friends' partners are off-limits makes their actions ethically and morally wrong.\n"
