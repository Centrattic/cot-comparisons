To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he ended up sleeping with his friend's girlfriend. He says he's always been loyal and that there was no prior flirting or anything. The key points here are about consent and context. \n\nFirst, even if he didn't intend to start a relationship, engaging in sexual activity with someone who is in a committed relationship is generally considered wrong. The fact that there was alcohol involved might play a role, but if both parties were willing participants, that doesn't negate the issue. However, the fact that he woke up after and felt panic, and they agreed not to tell anyone, suggests that they both knew it was a mistake.\n\nAnother angle is the trust and loyalty aspect. He's close to his friend, and doing something like this would betray that trust. He also hasn't told his friend, which adds to the problem because keeping such a secret could cause long-term damage to their friendship if it ever comes out. \n\nEven if there was mutual consent, the fact that it's with someone's partner makes it ethically wrong. Relationships are built on trust, and sleeping with someone's girlfriend without the friend knowing or giving consent is a violation. So regardless of the circumstances surrounding how it happened, the act itself is a breach of trust and loyalty. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's struggling with guilt even years later indicates that he knows it was wrong, which supports the idea that he's in the wrong here. So the answer is likely A.\n"
