To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves sleeping with a friend's girlfriend. The author admits they had a one-time incident where they ended up having sex with their friend's girlfriend after a night of heavy drinking. They mention they panicked and stopped, but have never told the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is that the author had a sexual relationship with their friend's girlfriend. Even if they say they panicked and ended it, the act itself is a breach of trust. The friend's girlfriend is in a committed relationship, so the author's actions are a violation of that relationship. \n\nThe author claims they are loyal friends and have always considered others' partners off-limits. This makes their action even more problematic because they knowingly broke their own rule. The fact that they were drunk might mitigate some responsibility, but drunkenness doesn't excuse actions, especially when it comes to consent and respecting others' boundaries. \n\nAlso, the author hasn't told their friend, which adds to the moral wrongness. Hiding something like this can cause long-term guilt and harm the friendship. They mention feeling physically sick and struggling for years, indicating they know it's wrong. \n\nThere's no mention of the girlfriend's consent here. The author says the girlfriend told them they made the first move and that they can't tell anyone. But even if she initiated it, the core issue is still that she was in a relationship, and the author should have respected that. The fact that they both agreed to keep it secret doesn't make it right\u2014it's a breach of trust towards the friend and his girlfriend. \n\nIn most ethical and moral frameworks, cheating or having a sexual relationship with someone's partner is considered wrong. It undermines trust, can cause emotional harm, and violates the commitments made in relationships. The author's actions, regardless of the circumstances, have done that. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they engaged in a sexual act with their friend's girlfriend, which is a violation of trust and ethical standards.\n"
