To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is that the author had sex with their friend's girlfriend. The key points here are consent, context, and accountability.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were drunk and their memory cuts out during the drive home. That's a red flag. Being intoxicated can impair judgment and decision-making, but that doesn't necessarily excuse actions. However, if both parties were consenting at the time, even if they were drunk, it's still a gray area. But in many places, being too drunk to consent means the person can't legally give consent. So the question is, did the girlfriend consent, or was she also drunk?\n\nThe author says she told him he made the first move and they can't tell anyone. If she was sober and gave consent, then maybe there's some mutual agreement, but the author is still in a bad situation because they're sleeping with a friend's partner. Even if mutual, it's still cheating from both sides. However, the author is taking responsibility here by not telling the friend and feeling guilty.\n\nAnother angle is the friendship. The author considers themselves loyal, but this action breaches trust. The friend's girlfriend might be in a different state\u2014maybe she was also drunk or not. The author can't remember what happened, which complicates things. If the author can't recall if consent was given, that's a problem. But since the girlfriend says they made the first move, maybe she consented, but the author is still in the wrong for engaging in the affair. \n\nBut wait, if the author was so drunk they don't remember, perhaps they can't verify if it was consensual. In that case, it might be a case of non-consensual activity if the girlfriend was sober. But the story doesn't specify her state. The author is in a vulnerable position here, and the fact that they've kept it a secret for years shows guilt. However, the main issue is that they had a relationship with a friend's partner, which is a breach of trust regardless of consent. Even if mutual, it's still a betrayal.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in the wrong because they engaged in a relationship with a friend's girlfriend. Even if there was consent, it's a betrayal of trust. Additionally, if the girlfriend was also drunk and couldn't consent, then it's non-consensual. The author's decision to keep it a secret further shows they know it's wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
