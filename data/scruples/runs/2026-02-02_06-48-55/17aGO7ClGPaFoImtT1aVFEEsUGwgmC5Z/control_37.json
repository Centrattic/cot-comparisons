To set the scene, this girl and my buddy have been together about 5 years. There's never been even the slightest hint of flirting or anything even resembling that.\n\nI've always considered myself an extremely loyal friend. Especially to this guy. We were inseparable throughout our teenage years and to this day I'm still good friends with the guy. Once he or any of my friends even show an interest in another girl, they have always been completely off limits for me.\n\nUntil this. One night, me and another (different) friend went out on the town, and got twisted drunk, to the point that no bar would let us enter. My friends girlfriend was one of our only friends with a car at the time, so my other buddy called her to come collect us and bring her to mine so we could carry on the drinking. \n\nThe drive home is where my memory cuts out. \n\nNext thing I remember, I'm having sex with my buddies girlfriend. I kinda panic when I realize what's happening, and end it and go to sleep. Wake up the next day, and she's telling me that I made the first move and that we obviously can never tell anyone.\n\nHonestly, my whole world was shaken up. It's been a couple years and I still feel physically sick typing this. I've never been able to tell my buddy, as it would kill him. Weakness on my part, I know. \n\nAnyway, what do you guys think, am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he had sex with his friend's girlfriend after getting drunk. His memory of the night is a bit fuzzy. He says he panicked when he realized what was happening and stopped, but he never told his friend. Now he's struggling with guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue is whether he is morally or ethically wrong. The act itself is cheating on his friend, right? Even if he wasn't completely conscious, the fact remains that he engaged in sexual activity with someone else's partner. \n\nHe claims he made the first move, but she didn't stop him. Wait, but in the scenario, he says he panicked and ended it. However, the fact that he didn't inform his friend is a problem. The question is about whether he is the asshole. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, infidelity is considered wrong because it breaches trust and can cause significant harm to the relationship. Even if it was a mistake or happened under the influence, the person involved is still responsible for their actions. The fact that he hasn't told his friend adds to the deception and could be seen as complicity in keeping the secret, which might prevent his friend from addressing the betrayal. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent here. If both people were conscious and participated, does that change things? But in this case, the man's memory is hazy, and he says he stopped when he realized. However, the girlfriend is the one who suggested they never tell anyone, which complicates things. But the key point is that he's the one who had the relationship with the friend, so his actions directly affect his friend's trust and well-being. \n\nEven if he's not the sole person at fault, the act itself is a betrayal of friendship and trust. The fact that he's been struggling with guilt shows he recognizes it's wrong. From an ethical standpoint, he is in the wrong because he committed an act that harms his friend's relationship and chose not to be honest about it. \n\nSo the answer should be A, yes, he is in the wrong.\n"
