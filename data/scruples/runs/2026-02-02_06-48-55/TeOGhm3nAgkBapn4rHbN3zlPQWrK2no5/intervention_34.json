(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit because the parents don't allow discipline. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author babysat cousins a few times. The kids were well-behaved at first but then became unruly. The author tried ignoring them but when that didn't work, decided to discipline by withholding dessert. The parents didn't support any discipline and told the author to just ask the kids to stop. The author then refused to continue babysitting because they couldn't enforce discipline, leading to conflict with the parents and family members now siding against them.\n\nSo, the author's main argument is that they can't handle the kids properly without the authority to discipline them. The parents, on the other hand, don't want the babysitter to discipline. The family is saying the author is wrong to not let the kids have time-outs or other measures.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, usually a babysitter's authority is limited by the parents' instructions. If the parents explicitly say not to discipline, the babysitter might be overstepping by imposing their own rules. But also, the safety of the children and the babysitter's ability to manage the situation could be a factor. If the kids are dangerous or the parents aren't taking it seriously, the babysitter might have a point in refusing.\n\nSocially, there's a debate. Some might say the author is right to prioritize their own sanity and safety. Others might argue that as a babysitter, you can't enforce rules you weren't given. The parents have the final say in how their kids are raised. However, if the kids are being abusive or harmful, the babysitter could be justified in stepping back.\n\nIn this case, the author did attempt to follow the parents' rules initially but found it impossible. They tried to communicate their concerns but the parents were dismissive. The author made it clear they couldn't continue without the ability to manage behavior. The parents then blamed the author, leading to family conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents explicitly forbade discipline, then the author's decision to withhold dessert was against their wishes. However, the author had valid concerns about the kids' behavior and their own well-being. The parents might have failed to provide adequate guidelines. The author's refusal to continue under those conditions could be seen as reasonable self-preservation.\n\nBut from the family's perspective, the author took it upon themselves to discipline the kids without permission, which the parents didn't want. That could be seen as overstepping. However, the parents didn't set clear boundaries ahead of time. The author tried to find a compromise but the parents didn't take the complaints seriously, leading to the decision to stop. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author likely isn't in the wrong because they set boundaries based on their own experience and safety. The parents, on the other hand, didn't establish clear expectations beforehand. However, the author could have approached it differently, perhaps by setting limits that didn't involve taking away dessert but maybe other methods. But given the circumstances, their stance seems justifiable.\n"
