(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about babysitting relatives' kids but being told not to discipline them, which the author found impossible because the kids were very misbehaving. The author decided to stop babysitting and now the family is upset, saying it's not a babysitter's job to discipline. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is whether a babysitter should be allowed to discipline children when the parents prohibit it. The author tried to manage the kids but found it impossible without disciplinary measures, leading to a conflict.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were trying to maintain control and ensure the kids' safety and their own sanity. They tried ignoring at first, then used a method (taking away dessert) which the parents didn't agree with. The parents then said they don't discipline, just ask the kids to stop. The author felt that without discipline, they couldn't handle the kids, especially as the children were aggressive and harmful (like tormenting the cat). \n\nThe parents' side is that they don't want anyone else disciplining their kids, even if the babysitter is doing it to manage behavior. They might believe that as a non-parent, the babysitter overstepped. The family's reaction is that the author is at fault for not just \"taking it\" even if it's hard.\n\nLegally, parents have the authority to set rules for their children. A babysitter, unless given explicit permission, shouldn't impose their own discipline. However, the author's actions were in response to dangerous behavior (kids trying to hit, tormenting the cat), which could be a safety issue. \n\nBut ethically, if the parents don't want discipline, the babysitter might need to communicate that they can't provide care without that ability. The author did mention their concerns, and the parents didn't budge. The author then decided to stop, which could be seen as standing up for their own well-being. \n\nHowever, the author's method of discipline (taking away dessert) wasn't discussed with the parents first, which might have been a misstep. If they had asked the parents what consequences they prefer, maybe they could have found a middle ground. But the parents had already stated they don't use discipline, so maybe that wasn't possible.\n\nThe key points are consent and safety. If the kids were in danger of harming others or themselves, the babysitter has a duty to intervene, but within the parents' rules. Since the parents said not to discipline, the author might have overstepped by taking away dessert without agreement. However, the kids' behavior was extreme, leading to a breakdown in care.\n\nIn family dynamics, the author is being criticized for not accepting the situation. The family's belief that only parents can discipline might make the author's actions controversial. However, the author's right to set their own boundaries is also valid. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were within the parents' guidelines and if they communicated their limits properly. The parents didn't allow any discipline, so the author's method was against their wishes. But the author's refusal to continue was based on their inability to manage the kids without it. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be partially at fault for not finding a compromise, but also justified in standing down when the situation was untenable. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer could be that they're not entirely wrong, but maybe there's nuance. However, since the options are A (yes) or B (no), the consensus might lean more towards B, the author isn't wrong because they were protecting their own well-being and the children's safety (from each other and the cat), even if they didn't handle the communication perfectly.\n"
