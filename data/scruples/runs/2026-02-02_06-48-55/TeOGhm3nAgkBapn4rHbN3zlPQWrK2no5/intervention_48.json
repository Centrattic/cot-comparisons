(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves babysitting for distant relatives and refusing to continue because the parents don't allow discipline. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author babysat cousins a few times, found them very misbehaving, tried to discipline them (like withholding dessert) which the parents didn't support. The parents wanted the author to just ask the kids to stop and not discipline them. The author then quit and now the family is turning against them, saying strangers shouldn't discipline children.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the parents have the authority to decide how their children are disciplined. The author took it upon themselves to impose consequences without the parents' approval, which the parents clearly don't want. That could be seen as overstepping. Also, the author's method of discipline (withholding dessert) might be something the parents didn't agree to, leading to conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the kids were extremely misbehaving, and the author felt it was necessary to maintain order. The parents' lack of discipline might be enabling the children's behavior. The author tried to communicate their concerns respectfully but was met with hostility. \n\nThe core issue is whether a babysitter has the right to discipline without the parents' consent. In many cases, discipline should align with the parents' rules. If the parents don't want the sitter to use any form of punishment, even time-outs, the author might be breaking the parents' preferences. However, if the children's behavior is harmful or dangerous, the sitter might need to step in, but the scenario here is about tantrums and insubordination, not safety issues.\n\nThe author's refusal to continue babysitting could be justified if they felt the parents were not supporting their ability to manage the kids effectively. However, the approach of imposing their own discipline without prior agreement might be where they went wrong. The parents might feel that the babysitter overstepped, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of family opinions, the relatives might be right in that the babysitter shouldn't decide the children's discipline. But it's also possible the parents are negligent. The author might be in the right in prioritizing their own well-being and the children's safety (if the behavior was harmful) but wrong in enforcing their own discipline without consent.\n\nConsidering these points, the answer might lean towards A (author in the wrong) because the parents set the boundaries, and the author didn't adhere to them. However, there's a strong argument that the parents are being unreasonable and the author is justified in refusing to be in a situation where they can't manage the children effectively. \n\nBut given that the parents explicitly said not to discipline and the author went against that, leading to conflict, the author might be in the wrong. However, if the parents' approach is enabling bad behavior, the author's stance could be seen as justified. It's a tricky balance between respecting parental authority and ensuring proper child management.\n"
