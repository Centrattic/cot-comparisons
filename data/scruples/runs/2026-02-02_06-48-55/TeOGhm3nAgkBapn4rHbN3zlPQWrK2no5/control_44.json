(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about babysitting distant relatives and the conflict that arose when the author tried to discipline the kids, which the parents didn't want. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the kids are misbehaving, and when they tried to discipline them by taking away dessert, the mother didn't approve. The parents said not to discipline the kids, just to ask them to stop or call the parents. The author explains their feelings and ends up refusing to babysit again, leading to the mother complaining to the family.\n\nSo the main issue is whether it's reasonable to expect the author to handle the kids without any disciplinary measures. The parents are the ones who set the rules, right? But if they don't enforce their own house rules, and the kids are being really bad (like tormenting the cat, throwing fits), maybe the author had a point. It's hard to manage children without any consequences. \n\nAlso, the author was trying to maintain order by using logical discipline, like taking away dessert as a consequence for not cleaning up. The parents might not agree with that method, but they didn't specify their own rules. The author warned the kids and gave them time, which sounds fair. \n\nThe mother's reaction was harsh, saying the author is a child and suggesting they don't know about kids. The author is now being criticized by other family members who think that only parents should discipline. But if the parents aren't providing any structure, the babysitter is left in a tough spot where they can't manage the behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have handled the situation differently. Perhaps they should have set boundaries without taking away dessert, or communicated more effectively with the parents upfront. But the parents didn't allow any discipline, so the author might have felt that it's not safe or feasible to continue without consequences. \n\nDisciplining kids is part of babysitting, even if it's just redirecting behavior or taking away privileges. If the parents don't allow any discipline, then the babysitter can't do their job properly. The author's actions were to protect their sanity and the kids' safety, especially with the aggression from the middle child. \n\nSo, considering that, the author probably isn't in the wrong. They were trying to manage the kids within the given parameters but realized it wasn't possible under the parents' restrictions. The parents are the ones not enforcing rules, which is their responsibility. The author's refusal to continue in such a scenario is justified.\n"
