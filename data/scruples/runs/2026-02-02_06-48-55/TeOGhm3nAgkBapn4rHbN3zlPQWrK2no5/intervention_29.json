(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to babysit because the parents don't allow discipline. The main points are that the kids were really misbehaving, the author tried to discipline them by taking away dessert, but the parents said they don't do any discipline. The author then quit and now the family is upset.\n\nHmm. So, the author's side is that they can't handle the kids without being allowed to discipline. The parents, however, set the rule that the babysitter shouldn't discipline the kids. The author felt they couldn't manage the kids without some form of consequence, leading to a clash. \n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's perspective, it's about setting boundaries. If the kids are being destructive and the parents don't want any discipline, maybe the babysitter is being asked to be passive in the face of bad behavior, which is unreasonable. On the other hand, parents do have the right to decide how their children are treated, even if others find their approach odd. The author might have overstepped by taking away dessert without permission, which the parents didn't agree to. \n\nThe parents might feel that the babysitter is imposing their own rules without consent, which could be seen as disrespectful. But the author had a valid reason to leave, given the chaotic environment. However, the way the author handled it\u2014like taking away dessert without permission\u2014could be the issue. Maybe the author should have discussed the expectations upfront before babysitting, rather than making unilateral decisions. \n\nAlso, the family's reaction is problematic. The mother calling the author an awful person and spreading complaints is definitely on her. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents explicitly said no discipline, the author had the right to refuse the job if they couldn't follow those rules. So, the author's decision to stop babysitting wasn't wrong. They can't be expected to tolerate a situation they find unmanageable. \n\nIn terms of cultural or family norms, some might believe that a babysitter shouldn't discipline, but that doesn't make the author wrong for prioritizing their well-being. The key is whether the author acted within the agreed terms. Since the parents didn't allow discipline and the author couldn't comply, refusing the job was justified. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
