(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The person is refusing to babysit for distant relatives because the parents don't allow them to discipline the kids. They had a bad experience where the kids were really unruly and they tried to impose some discipline, which led to conflict with the parents. The parents didn't support any discipline, and now the author is being criticized by family members for not handling it the right way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author tried to discipline the kids by withholding dessert, which the parents didn't agree with. The author then refused to continue babysitting because they couldn't manage the kids without discipline. The parents and family members are upset, saying it's not the babysitter's job to discipline. \n\nOn one hand, the author is within their rights to set boundaries. If the parents don't want the kids disciplined, but the kids are unmanageable, then the author isn't responsible for handling that. It's not safe or fair to expect a babysitter to handle out-of-control children without any support from the parents. The parents are the ones who have to enforce their own rules. If they don't want to discipline the kids, maybe they should handle the situations themselves instead of delegating to someone else. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried to communicate better. They did tell the parents about the issues and tried to follow their rules. When the parents didn't support discipline, the author made a decision to stop babysitting, which seems reasonable. The parents then reacted poorly, which reflects their own issues. The family members' belief that strangers shouldn't discipline kids might be outdated or just their own opinion, but it doesn't change the fact that the author acted in their own best interest and the kids' well-being.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the parents explicitly said not to discipline, but the kids are causing harm or danger, the author might be justified in stopping. However, the situation here seems more about the kids being naughty rather than dangerous. But withholding dessert isn't a harsh punishment, and the author tried to give warnings. The parents' refusal to enforce any discipline is problematic. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. Answer B.\n"
