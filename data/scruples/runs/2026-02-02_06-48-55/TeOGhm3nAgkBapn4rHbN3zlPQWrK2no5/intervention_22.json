(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves babysitting for distant relatives and a conflict over discipline. The user says they refused to babysit because the parents wouldn't let them discipline the kids, and now the family is turning against them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author felt that the kids were very misbehaved, and when they tried to discipline by not giving dessert, the parents didn't support that. The parents wanted the babysitter to just ask the kids to stop and call them if things got bad. The author felt that without the ability to discipline, they couldn't handle the kids, so they stopped babysitting. Now the parents are upset and spreading negative things about the author.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they can't manage the kids without discipline. They tried ignoring but that didn't work, so they took action by withholding dessert, which the parents didn't agree with. The author then stopped the babysitting and the parents are upset.\n\nOn the other side, the parents might feel that the babysitter overstepped by imposing their own discipline without prior agreement. They might believe that as a babysitter, they should follow the parents' rules, even if they don't agree. The author's refusal to continue might be seen as abandoning the responsibility without finding a middle ground.\n\nBut then again, the author is probably in a tough spot. If the kids are being harmful (like tormenting the cat), not being able to discipline could lead to unsafe situations. However, the author chose to take matters into their own hands with the dessert, which the parents didn't approve of. Maybe there's a lack of communication here. The parents didn't set clear guidelines initially, and the author tried to set some but the parents rejected it.\n\nAnother angle is the cultural or family norms mentioned. The user mentions that many family members believe a stranger (babysitter) shouldn't discipline the kids. That's a traditional view, but it doesn't necessarily make it right. The author might be challenging those norms, which could cause a rift in the family.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they did make the decision to stop babysitting after the conflict, which is their right. However, withholding dessert without the parents' consent might have been a mistake. If the parents explicitly said not to discipline, then the author went against their instructions, which could justify the parents' anger. But the author felt it was necessary for safety and sanity.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author had a valid concern about the kids' behavior and the lack of parental support. But perhaps there was a better way to handle it, like discussing boundaries beforehand or not taking the job if they couldn't agree. However, since the parents didn't set clear rules initially, the author might have been left in a difficult position.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, babysitters typically follow the parents' rules, but if those rules create an unsafe or unmanageable environment, the babysitter might have a right to refuse. The author's main issue is the lack of authority to enforce discipline. Whether that makes them wrong is debatable. The parents are upset because the babysitter didn't adhere to their wishes, but the babysitter felt those wishes made the job impossible.\n\nSo considering all that, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They had legitimate reasons to refuse the job under those conditions. However, how they handled the situation (withholding dessert without prior agreement) could be seen as crossing a line. The key point is the expectation vs. reality of the babysitting arrangement.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they had a right to set boundaries for their own well-being and the children's safety. The parents also have a right to set their own rules, but if those rules make the job unfeasible, the babysitter can choose to step back. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
