(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to babysit because the parents don't allow discipline. The author tried to discipline the kids once but the parents didn't support it and then the author quit. Now the family is turning against them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's perspective is that the kids were really misbehaving, and without the ability to discipline them, it's impossible to manage. They felt they had to set boundaries to maintain control. The parents, on the other hand, didn't want the babysitter to discipline their kids, maybe because they have their own methods or don't want others involved. The author then refused to continue, which led to conflict.\n\nIn terms of babysitting responsibilities, typically the parents set the rules. A babysitter's role is to follow the parents' instructions. If the parents don't allow any discipline, the babysitter might have to work within those boundaries. However, if the kids are being physically aggressive or causing harm, that's different. Here, the kids were throwing tantrums, not the parents. The author tried to enforce a rule (taking away dessert) without prior agreement, which the parents might not have approved. The parents then asked the author to just ask the kids to stop, not discipline, which the author didn't agree with.\n\nThe author's action of taking away dessert might have been overstepping if that wasn't a family rule. The parents could see it as the babysitter making unilateral decisions. When the author confronted the parents about the behavior, they were told to just follow their instructions, but the author felt those instructions weren't effective. The author then quit, which is their right, but the parents are now complaining, leading the family to side with them.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Did the author overstep by implementing discipline without parent approval? 2) Is it reasonable to refuse to babysit if the parents' approach doesn't match the author's ability to handle the kids?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, a babysitter usually has a duty of care but must follow the parents' rules. If the parents don't want discipline, the babysitter can't impose their own. Emotionally, the author felt the kids were too much to handle without discipline, which is understandable. However, the author could have set boundaries before accepting the job or communicated better. Walking out after the first incident might have been abrupt.\n\nFamily dynamics play a role too. The author's relatives think it's not the sitter's place to discipline. That's a common belief in some cultures or families. The author's approach might clash with those norms, leading to conflict. The parents' reaction (calling family and badmouthing) is problematic, but the author's refusal is based on personal limits.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions are understandable given the situation, they might be seen as overstepping by imposing their own rules without prior agreement. However, they're also within their rights to set boundaries and not take on a job that's harmful to them. The answer hinges on whether enforcing discipline is part of the job as per the parents' instructions. Since the parents didn't allow it, the author's refusal to comply and subsequent exit is justified, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
