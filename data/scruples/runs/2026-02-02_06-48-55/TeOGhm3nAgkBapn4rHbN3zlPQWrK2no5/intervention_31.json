(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit because the parents don't allow discipline. The author explained that the kids were really misbehaving, and when they tried to discipline, the parents didn't support them. The author then stopped babysitting and now the family is turning on them because they think a babysitter shouldn't discipline.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents explicitly said they don't want the babysitter to discipline the kids. The author tried to discipline and then refused to continue the job under those conditions. The parents are now upset and spreading negative opinions.\n\nBut here's the thing: as a babysitter, especially for non-own children, you need the parents' approval on discipline methods. If the parents don't want any discipline, that's their choice, but then the babysitter has a hard job. However, the author took it upon themselves to enforce discipline without the parents' consent, which might be a breach of trust. The parents might have had their reasons for not disciplining, maybe a different parenting approach, or maybe they just don't want others to do it. The author went against their wishes, which could be seen as overstepping. \n\nOn the other hand, the kids were being really unruly, and the parents are aware. If the parents aren't enforcing rules, maybe the author had a right to say they can't handle it. But the issue is whether it's acceptable to refuse babysitting if the conditions are unmet. The author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong, but the way they handled it might be. They could have set boundaries upfront, like not taking the job unless allowed to discipline. But once they accepted the job, and the parents made their stance clear, maybe the author shouldn't have acted against that. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as taking sides against the parents' parenting style, especially in front of the kids. The parents' reaction could be justified because they felt disrespected. The author's refusal after the fact might be their right, but the way they communicated it caused a family conflict. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't clarify their expectations before accepting the babysitting role and then acted against the parents' wishes without mutual agreement. The parents have the right to set their conditions, even if those conditions are challenging for the babysitter. The author's approach could be seen as overstepping their role, leading to the family's backlash.\n"
