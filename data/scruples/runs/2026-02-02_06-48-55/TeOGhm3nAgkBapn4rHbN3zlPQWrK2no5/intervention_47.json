(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to babysit for relatives because they don't allow the author to discipline the kids. The author had previous experience with the kids being very naughty and tried to use a discipline method (taking away dessert) without prior approval. The parents didn't discipline the kids and instead told the author to just ask the kids to stop. The author gave up and stopped babysitting, leading to conflict with the relatives.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the right to discipline children when babysitting. The author's perspective is that without the ability to discipline, they can't handle the kids. The relatives believe that the babysitter shouldn't have the authority to discipline, which is causing a rift in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in babysitting. Typically, a babysitter is expected to follow the parents' rules and house discipline. If the parents don't want the sitter to impose any discipline, the sitter needs to adhere to that. However, the author felt that without any disciplinary measures, it was impossible to manage the kids' behavior, leading to a breakdown in the situation.\n\nThe author's actions included withholding dessert, which was a form of discipline not approved by the parents. Even if the kids were misbehaving, the parents might have expected the sitter to communicate the behavior issues rather than take unilateral action. The parents' response was to tell the author to just ask the kids to stop, which is a more permissive approach. The author might have felt that this approach was ineffective, leading to their refusal to continue.\n\nBut from the parents' side, they might see the author as overstepping by implementing their own discipline without consent. The parents might have their own parenting style and could be averse to others, even babysitters, imposing their methods. The author's refusal to comply with the parents' wishes could be seen as disrespectful or not following instructions.\n\nHowever, the author's concern is valid if the parents are not enforcing discipline at all, leading to a chaotic environment. If the parents are unwilling to set boundaries, the babysitter might be left in a difficult position where they can't manage the children effectively. The author might have a right to decline the job if the conditions make it impossible to perform the duties safely and effectively.\n\nThe relatives turning the family against the author suggests a cultural or familial norm that strangers shouldn't discipline children. The author might not have considered this cultural context, thinking it's a reasonable request to have some disciplinary authority. However, the parents might have a legitimate expectation that their children are not to be disciplined by others, even if the children are difficult.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents clearly stated their rules and the author didn't agree, the author has the right to refuse the job. However, the author might have made an assumption that discipline was necessary without discussing acceptable methods with the parents first. The key might be communication. The author could have expressed the need for some form of discipline and attempted to negotiate acceptable methods with the parents. Instead, they took action without approval, leading to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might not have provided clear guidelines for managing behavior, leaving the sitter in an impossible situation. In that case, the author's refusal is justified because the parents are not providing the necessary support for the babysitter to do their job effectively. The author's right to set boundaries is important for their well-being and safety.\n\nPutting it all together, the answer depends on whether the author communicated their needs before taking action. The author may have been in the wrong by implementing discipline without discussing it with the parents. However, if the parents are unwilling to enforce any discipline, the author's refusal could be seen as reasonable. Since the parents didn't allow any discipline, the author's decision to decline babysitting might be justified. But the way it was handled\u2014without prior agreement on methods\u2014could be seen as a misstep.\n"
