(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to babysit their relatives because the parents don't allow any form of discipline. The author tried disciplining the kids once, which led to conflict with the parents, and now the family is turning against them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in babysitting. Typically, when a parent hires a babysitter, they expect the sitter to follow their house rules, including discipline methods. However, in this case, the author wasn't working for a living but doing a favor for family. The parents made it clear they didn't want the author to discipline the kids, which the author respected after the initial incident.\n\nThe author's frustration comes from the kids being very difficult and the parents not enforcing any discipline. The author felt they couldn't manage the kids without being able to impose some form of control. When the parents refused to set boundaries, the author decided to stop babysitting, which led to conflict.\n\nNow, the family's reaction is that the author overstepped by disciplining the kids, even if it was in their own home. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The parents didn't set clear rules, but the author took it upon themselves to enforce rules. However, the parents were explicit in their no-discipline policy. The author's approach of refusing to comply with the parents' wishes might be seen as crossing a line, especially in a family context where expectations might differ from a professional setting.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions were to maintain order and protect themselves from stress. The parents' lack of discipline might be contributing to the children's behavior. The author's decision to stop babysitting could be seen as standing up for their own well-being.\n\nBut in terms of social norms, the author might be expected to either accept the parents' rules or find a way to communicate their concerns without enforcing their own discipline. The key point is that the parents asked not to discipline, and the author went against that, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the right because they had a valid reason to refuse to continue babysitting under those conditions. However, the way they handled the initial discipline (taking away dessert) might have been a mistake since the parents didn't allow it. The author could have discussed their concerns before taking that action. The parents' reaction, however, is also problematic. The author's refusal to continue is about their own boundaries, which is reasonable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because they were protecting their own mental health and setting boundaries with the understanding that they couldn't enforce discipline. The parents' lack of rules is part of the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
