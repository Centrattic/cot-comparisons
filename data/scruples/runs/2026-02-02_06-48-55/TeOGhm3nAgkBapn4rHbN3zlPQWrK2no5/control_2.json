(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit because the family didn't allow discipline. So, the situation is that the author babysat for some cousins, but the kids were really misbehaving. The author tried to discipline them by taking away dessert, which led to a big tantrum. The parents didn't want the author to discipline the kids, just to ask them to stop and call if something bad happened. The author then quit, and the family is now criticizing them.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: they felt it was necessary to discipline the kids to maintain order, but the parents didn't agree. The author's actions were within the context of trying to manage the children, but the parents' rules were clear. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by imposing their own disciplinary actions without the parents' approval.\n\nThe author did warn the kids about the dessert consequence, which might be a form of time-out, but the parents didn't agree with any form of discipline by the babysitter. The author's refusal to continue under those conditions is a matter of personal boundaries. They felt they couldn't handle the behavior without the right to discipline.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel that the babysitter was not respecting their parenting rules. The author's method of discipline (taking dessert) wasn't discussed beforehand, which could be a problem. However, the parents did allow some form of discipline initially but then changed their stance.\n\nThe family's reaction seems harsh, but the author's decision to prioritize their own well-being and the children's safety (like not letting them touch the cat) is valid. The parents' approach to discipline (not doing anything) might contribute to the children's behavior. The author is in a difficult position where their efforts to manage the kids are met with criticism, even though the parents acknowledge the behavior issues.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for setting boundaries. The parents have the right to set the rules, but if they don't enforce discipline themselves, it's hard to blame the babysitter for not being able to do it under their constraints. The author isn't the parent, so they can't enforce discipline against the parents' wishes. However, refusing to work under those conditions is about personal limits. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own mental health and safety. They clearly communicated the issue and stood by their decision. The family's side reactions are more about their own issues than the author being wrong.\n"
