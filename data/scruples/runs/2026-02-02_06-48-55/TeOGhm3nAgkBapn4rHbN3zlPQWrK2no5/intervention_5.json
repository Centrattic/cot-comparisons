(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they were babysitting for distant relatives, and the kids were really misbehaving. The author tried to discipline them by taking away dessert, which the parents didn't allow. Then they decided not to babysit anymore because the parents said they couldn't discipline the kids. Now the family is turning against them, saying it's not a babysitter's job to discipline.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a babysitting situation. Usually, parents expect the babysitter to follow their house rules. If the parents don't allow any form of discipline, the babysitter might have a hard time managing the kids. But if the kids are being really problematic, maybe the babysitter has the right to set some boundaries? Or is that overstepping?\n\nThe author mentions that the parents said not to discipline the kids, but the kids were acting out a lot. The author tried ignoring, then used dessert as a consequence, which the parents disapproved of. The author then refused to continue babysitting because they couldn't enforce discipline. The parents were upset and are now spreading negative things about the author in the family.\n\nI need to think about whether the author had the right to refuse to follow the parents' house rules. If the parents explicitly said not to discipline the kids, then the author might have breached an agreement by trying to discipline them. On the other hand, if the kids were being so disruptive that it was unmanageable without any discipline, maybe the author had a valid reason to leave. \n\nAlso, the author's approach of taking away dessert without prior agreement with the parents could be seen as overstepping. The parents might feel that the babysitter is making unilateral decisions about their children's behavior. However, the author did try to communicate their concerns to the parents and set boundaries, which the parents rejected. Then the author walked away, which might be justifiable if the situation was untenable.\n\nAnother angle is that the parents are not following through with their own discipline methods. They don't discipline the kids themselves, so when the babysitter tries to step in, they get upset. In that case, the parents might be at fault for not setting clear expectations or managing their children's behavior. \n\nBut in terms of the babysitter's responsibility, they are usually expected to follow the parents' instructions. If the parents don't want any discipline, the babysitter might have to accept that, even if the kids are difficult. However, if the kids are being abusive or dangerous, the babysitter might have a duty to protect themselves and refuse the job. The author mentions the kids hit and insulted them, which is a safety issue. In that case, leaving the job is reasonable.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author tried to manage the situation according to the parents' rules but found it impossible. They set a boundary that they wouldn't continue without the ability to discipline. The parents were against that. The author's decision to refuse to babysit under those conditions might be justified, especially if the kids were threatening safety. The parents' reaction and spreading negative comments might be their fault for not managing their children properly. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they prioritized their well-being and safety.\n"
