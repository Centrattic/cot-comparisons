(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves babysitting for distant relatives and the author refusing because the parents don't allow discipline.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author babysat for their cousins a few times. The kids were misbehaving, and when the author tried to discipline them by withholding dessert, the parents didn't approve. The parents said they don't discipline and just ask the kids to stop. The author then quit babysitting and now the family is upset, with many on the parents' side. The author is being criticized for not handling it well, especially since some family members think it's not a stranger's place to discipline the kids.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was right to refuse to babysit without the ability to discipline. The author's reasoning is that without discipline, they can't manage the children's behavior, leading to chaos. The parents, however, don't want the babysitter to impose their own discipline.\n\nFrom a childcare perspective, consistency in discipline is important. If the parents don't enforce rules, the children might not respect anyone, including the babysitter. But the parents have the ultimate authority. The author might have overstepped by taking matters into their own hands (like withholding dessert) without the parents' consent. That could be seen as disrespectful or taking on a parental role they weren't hired for.\n\nHowever, the author's concern is valid. If the parents don't discipline, the babysitter is left in a difficult position. The kids' behavior could become unmanageable, leading to stress for everyone. The author might have communicated their feelings but the parents didn't listen, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some people believe only parents should discipline children. The author's family members supporting the parents might be influenced by this. But others might agree that a babysitter should have some authority. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014quitting after the conflict\u2014could be seen as standing up for their boundaries. However, the way they handled the discipline (withholding dessert) might have been the issue. They should have discussed expectations with the parents beforehand instead of assuming authority.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author's refusal to continue babysitting under those conditions isn't necessarily wrong, but the method of handling the discipline without prior agreement might be where they went wrong. The parents have the right to set the rules, and the babysitter should ideally work within those unless given authority. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach might have been a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they took disciplinary actions without the parents' consent, which breached their role as a babysitter, even though their reasoning had merit.\n"
