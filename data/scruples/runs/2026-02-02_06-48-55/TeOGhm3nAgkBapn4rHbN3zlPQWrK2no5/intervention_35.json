(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit because the parents don't allow discipline. So first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author had a bad experience babysitting their cousins. The kids were well-behaved at first but then became really difficult. The author tried to discipline them by taking away dessert, which the kids and parents didn't like. The parents said they don't discipline and just ask the kids to stop, so the author refused to continue. Now the parents are spreading negative things about the author, and the author's extended family is taking their side, saying it's not a babysitter's job to discipline.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The key points are the parents' expectations vs. the author's needs. The parents clearly stated they don't discipline, but the author felt that without discipline, they couldn't manage the kids. The author tried to enforce their own rules (like taking away dessert) without prior agreement. The parents then asked the author to just ask the kids to stop, not discipline. The author then quit, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom a boundary perspective, the author might think they're justified because they can't handle the kids' behavior without discipline. But the parents might see it as overstepping, as they don't want any discipline from someone else. The family's reaction suggests they believe the author went beyond their role.\n\nBut babysitting often requires some form of discipline, even if it's just redirecting behavior. If the parents refuse any form of discipline, then maybe the author is right to refuse, as it's a safety issue. However, the author took initiative to discipline without prior agreement, which the parents might find unacceptable. So maybe the author should have clarified expectations beforehand.\n\nThe parents' approach might be unwise, but the author's action of taking away dessert without consent could be seen as overstepping. The author might have handled it better by setting boundaries up front, like discussing discipline methods before babysitting. Instead, they imposed their own method, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the parent, so they don't have the authority to enforce discipline without the parents' approval. The parents' stance, while perhaps permissive, is their choice. The author's refusal to comply might be reasonable if the kids are a danger, but if it's just behavioral issues, they might be overreacting.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the right to refuse unsafe conditions but in the wrong for not discussing discipline methods first. However, since the parents made it clear they don't discipline, and the author tried to enforce their own rules, leading to conflict, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong. But there's a nuance here.\n\nAlternatively, if the kids are unmanageable without discipline, the author is justified in refusing. The parents are responsible for their parenting style, but the author isn't obligated to accept conditions that make the job impossible. So perhaps the author is not in the wrong.\n"
