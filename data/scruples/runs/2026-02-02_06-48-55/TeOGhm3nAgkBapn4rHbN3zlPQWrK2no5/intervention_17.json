(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is being asked to babysit for distant relatives. The kids are described as very misbehaving, not just a little but really bad\u2014throwing tantrums, being mean, hitting, etc. The author tried to discipline them by taking away dessert after not cleaning up, which the parents didn't want. The parents said they don't discipline the kids and told the author to just ask them to stop or call them if something bad happens. The author then decided not to babysit anymore because they couldn't handle the kids' behavior and the parents' lack of discipline. The mom got angry, and now other family members are taking her side, saying it's not a sitter's job to discipline.\n\nThe author is confused because they think it's reasonable to have some control over the kids when babysitting, but the family thinks it's wrong for someone else to discipline the children. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The author's reasoning: they can't manage the kids effectively without the ability to discipline, leading to a chaotic environment. The parents' reasoning: they don't want the sitter to discipline the kids, which seems like they're aware of the behavior but not addressing it themselves. The author then decides to stop babysitting, which the parents and family members disapprove of, calling the author the problem.\n\nFrom an ethics standpoint, is it wrong to set boundaries when babysitting? If the job requires managing the kids' behavior, and the parents refuse to allow that, the author might be right in saying it's not feasible. However, the author took it upon themselves to discipline the kids without prior agreement, which might have been a problem. The parents didn't agree to the sitter using dessert as a punishment, so the author went against the parents' wishes by doing that. That could be seen as overstepping their role as a babysitter.\n\nBut then, the author tried to set boundaries after the parents allowed them to ask the kids to stop, but the parents didn't provide any discipline methods. The author might feel that without discipline tools, the job is impossible. The parents' approach of not disciplining could be seen as neglecting their responsibility, but the author is in a position where they need to enforce some order to function.\n\nThe author's refusal to babysit again could be justified if the parents didn't provide any structure or discipline methods beforehand. The author is not the parent, but they need to manage the kids during their care. However, taking away dessert without the parents' consent might have been an issue. The parents might have agreed to some methods but not others. The author's action could have violated the parents' wishes, even if the parents were not effective.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are clearly in a situation where their kids are out of control, and they're not taking responsibility. The author is trying to do their job, which includes some level of discipline, and the parents are obstructing that. The author's right to set boundaries for their own well-being is valid. If the parents don't want the kids to be disciplined, they shouldn't expect someone else to manage them effectively.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author did act without prior agreement on discipline methods, which might have been wrong. However, the parents' refusal to allow any discipline makes the job impossible, so the author's decision to stop is understandable. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by taking away dessert without the parents' approval. If the parents had agreed to certain methods, then the author might be wrong. But since they didn't, the author might have been trying to manage the situation as best as they could, given that the parents were not providing any tools.\n\nIn terms of the family's reaction, it's possible that the author is in the right because they're not responsible for the parents' parenting style. If the parents don't want their kids to be disciplined, they should find a sitter who can handle it within their rules. The author is protecting their own sanity and safety. However, the initial act of taking away dessert without the parents' knowledge might have been a mistake. The author should have discussed possible discipline strategies with the parents before implementing them.\n\nSo, putting it all together, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong. They were trying to manage a situation that was untenable without proper discipline methods. The parents are at fault for not setting clear expectations. The author's refusal to continue under those conditions is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
