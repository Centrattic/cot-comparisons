(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about babysitting for distant relatives who don't allow any discipline. The author tried to manage the kids' behavior by taking away dessert, which the parents didn't approve of. Then when the parents asked them to babysit again, the author refused, leading to the family turning against them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They might feel that the babysitter overstepped by disciplining their kids without their consent. They probably believe that only they should have the authority to set and enforce rules. The author's action of taking away dessert could be seen as violating that boundary. Also, when the parents told the author not to discipline the kids, the author continued to give chances, which the parents might see as not respecting their instructions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's point is that the kids were being extremely difficult\u2014throwing tantrums, hitting, insulting. The author was in a position where they couldn't control the situation effectively without discipline. The parents' approach of not disciplining at all might be contributing to the kids' behavior. The author felt it was necessary to set some boundaries to manage the situation, especially when the parents weren't doing it.\n\nNow, thinking about the cultural or familial norms mentioned. The author's family members argue that a stranger (the babysitter) shouldn't discipline the children. Maybe in their family culture, discipline is strictly the parents' role, and the babysitter's job is just to supervise. But from the author's perspective, without the ability to discipline, the job becomes impossible and stressful. \n\nThe parents' reaction\u2014calling family members and complaining\u2014suggests they might have felt disrespected by the author's refusal to continue babysitting under their terms. The author might be seen as causing a rift in the family by standing up for their boundaries. \n\nBut then, if the parents are aware of the kids' misbehavior and still refuse to let the babysitter manage it, maybe the problem is on their side. The author isn't wrong for wanting a safe and manageable environment. However, the way they handled it might have been abrupt. Maybe they could have tried to negotiate or find a compromise, but the parents were unwilling. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are: Did the author overstep by disciplining? The parents didn't allow it, but the kids were acting out in harmful ways. The author's actions might be justified if they felt it was necessary for safety. But the parents have the authority to set the rules for their children. The author's refusal to continue babysitting after being told not to discipline could be seen as a valid choice to protect their own well-being. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries and refusing to work in a situation that's harmful or stressful. However, the parents have a right to set their own rules for babysitters. The conflict arises from differing expectations. The author's right to refuse the job under those conditions is their choice, but the way they communicated it might have caused family tension. But overall, I think the author is justified in prioritizing their own needs and the parents are at fault for not addressing the kids' behavior. So answer B.\n"
