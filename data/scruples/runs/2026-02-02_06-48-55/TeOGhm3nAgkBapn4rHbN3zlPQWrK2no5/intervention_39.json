(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their relatives' kids because the parents don't allow discipline. The situation involves the kids being really misbehaving, and the author tried to discipline them by taking away dessert, which the parents didn't like. Then the author quit, and now the parents are spreading negative stuff, and family members are taking the parents' side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The key issue here is whether it's reasonable for the author to expect the ability to discipline the children when babysitting. The parents explicitly said they don't want the author to discipline the kids. The author tried to enforce some rules, which led to conflict, and then they refused to continue the babysitting unless they had the authority to manage the kids' behavior.\n\nFrom a childcare perspective, consistency and clear boundaries are important. If the parents are not enforcing any discipline themselves, it might be impossible for a babysitter to manage the children effectively. The author mentioned that the kids were being mean and throwing tantrums, and the parents didn't take action. The author tried to take away dessert as a consequence, which the parents didn't support. That could lead to confusion for the children\u2014why is the babysitter imposing consequences when the parents aren't?\n\nBut then, the other side is that the author is a babysitter, not the parent. The parents should be responsible for setting the rules and discipline. If they don't want the babysitter to discipline the kids, maybe they're not ready to take on the responsibility of managing their children's behavior. The author might be right in standing up for their own well-being, especially if the kids are being abusive or dangerous. The author also mentioned the kids were tormenting the cat, which is a concern for animal safety.\n\nThe family members who side with the parents argue that a stranger shouldn't discipline a child. That's a traditional view, but in practice, if a childcare provider can't enforce some level of discipline, it's impossible to manage the situation. The parents are in a position to set the house rules, but if they don't do it, they can't expect the babysitter to do so without their approval.\n\nThe author's approach was to take away dessert, which is a consequence the parents usually handle. The parents might not want the babysitter to make unilateral decisions about their child's rewards and punishments. The author could have discussed the consequences with the parents first, maybe set up a system beforehand. However, the parents didn't establish any rules, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author did explain their concerns and the need for discipline, but the parents refused. The author then tried to warn the parents about the behavior but was dismissed. The author's decision to quit was based on self-preservation and respecting the parents' stated rules, even if those rules make the situation unmanageable. The parents then reacted poorly and spread negative opinions, which is problematic.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is whether they overstepped by taking disciplinary action without the parents' permission. But the parents didn't provide clear guidelines, leading to a chaotic situation. The author's right to set boundaries is important for their own well-being. However, the parents have the right to decide what discipline is acceptable, even if their approach is flawed.\n\nOn one hand, the author acted in a way they believed would keep the kids in check. On the other hand, they didn't have the authority the parents granted. The key is whether the author was wrong to enforce consequences the parents didn't agree to. The parents might not have wanted the babysitter to make those decisions, which is their prerogative. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by taking action against the parents' wishes. But if the parents aren't providing any structure, the author's hands are tied, and it's reasonable for them to refuse to work under those conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's refusal to continue babysitting under the given conditions is understandable for their own well-being, but the initial act of disciplining without explicit permission might be seen as overstepping. However, since the parents didn't provide any structure, the author's actions were a reasonable attempt to manage the situation. The parents' behavior after the fact is problematic, but the original question is whether the author was in the wrong in their actions. Given the parents' stance, the author is not in the wrong for refusing to work under those conditions, even if their disciplinary actions were a bit bold. So the answer would be B.\n"
