(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The author refused to babysit distant relatives because they weren't allowed to discipline the kids. The family is now turning against them, saying that a babysitter shouldn't discipline the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The kids are described as very misbehaving, and the parents don't discipline them either. The author tried to set boundaries by using dessert as a consequence, but the parents didn't support that and instead told the author to just ask the kids to stop. When the author explained their concerns and refused to continue, the parents were upset and spread negative things about them. The family members are on the parents' side, thinking the author shouldn't discipline the kids.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (answer A) or not (answer B). \n\nI need to evaluate whether the author's actions were justified. The parents explicitly stated they don't want the author to discipline the children, but the kids' behavior is problematic. The author tried to manage the situation within the parents' guidelines but found it impossible. Refusing to continue babysitting under those conditions seems reasonable because the parents aren't enforcing discipline themselves. However, the author did take disciplinary action (taking away dessert) without the parents' consent, which might be a point of contention. \n\nBut wait, the parents didn't allow any discipline, yet the kids' behavior was so bad that the author felt they couldn't handle it without some form of consequence. The parents' lack of discipline might contribute to the problem. The author's refusal to continue could be seen as a reasonable decision to protect their own well-being. However, by not following the parents' rules and taking disciplinary action first, the author might have overstepped their role as a babysitter. \n\nOn the other hand, if the parents don't enforce their own discipline, and the babysitter can't manage the kids without any tools, the author is in a tough spot. The parents are responsible for setting and enforcing rules, and if they don't, the babysitter isn't at fault for not being able to handle it. The author's decision to stop babysitting is a boundary, which is valid. \n\nThe family's belief that a stranger shouldn't discipline the kids is a cultural or family norm, but if the parents aren't enforcing discipline themselves, that norm might be contributing to the problem. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own sanity and safety. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They made a difficult choice based on the parents' refusal to set boundaries, which left the babysitter without the tools to manage the situation effectively. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
