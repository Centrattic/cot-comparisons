(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was babysitting their cousins and felt the need to discipline them because the kids were being really difficult. The parents didn't want the author to discipline the kids, so the author stopped babysitting and now the family is taking the parents' side, saying it's not a babysitter's job to discipline.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations around babysitting. Typically, when you're a babysitter, even if you're a family member, you might have some responsibility to manage the children's behavior. If the kids are being disruptive and the parents don't allow any discipline, that could create a conflict. The author tried to handle it by setting some limits, like taking away dessert, which the parents didn't approve of. \n\nBut the parents had a clear stance: they don't discipline the kids, so they don't want the babysitter to either. From their perspective, the author was overstepping by imposing their own rules without their consent. Even if the kids are being difficult, the parents might see the babysitter's actions as going against their parenting style. \n\nOn the other hand, the author felt that without the ability to enforce some rules, it's impossible to manage the kids. The kids were aggressive, hitting, and throwing tantrums, which could be concerning. The author tried to communicate their concerns and set boundaries, which the parents reacted poorly to. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. If you're babysitting, you're expected to care for the children, which includes managing their behavior to some extent. But if the parents explicitly say they don't want you to discipline them, then the babysitter might need to either agree to those terms or decline the job. The author chose the latter, which is understandable if they can't handle the situation without discipline. However, the way they handled the conflict might have been abrupt or confrontational, leading to the family's disapproval.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' responsibility. If the kids are consistently misbehaving and the parents don't address it, that's their parenting issue. But the babysitter is a guest in their home and might not have the authority to impose their own methods. The author tried to set limits but was met with hostility. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in assuming they could set their own rules without prior agreement. Maybe they should have discussed boundaries before agreeing to babysit. However, once they realized the parents' stance, they had the right to withdraw from the situation. The parents' reaction of badmouthing the author is also problematic, but the question is about the author's actions.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they have the right to set their own boundaries. However, their approach could have been more diplomatic. But given the circumstances, refusing to babysit when the parents don't allow discipline is reasonable. So I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
