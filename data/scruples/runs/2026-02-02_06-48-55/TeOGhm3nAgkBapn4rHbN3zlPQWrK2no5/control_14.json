(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to babysit distant relatives because they don't allow any form of discipline. The main points to consider are the dynamics between babysitters, parental authority, and the expectations of the family.\n\nFirst, the author describes the kids as being very naughty, even when the parents are present. The parents don't enforce discipline, so when the author tried to discipline by withholding dessert, they were told not to do that. The author then refused to continue babysitting because they couldn't manage the kids without being allowed some form of discipline. The parents reacted negatively, and now the author is facing backlash from extended family.\n\nI need to determine if the author was wrong to set that boundary. The key here is the role of a babysitter. Typically, a babysitter is expected to follow the parents' rules and guidelines. If the parents don't allow any discipline, the babysitter might feel they can't manage the children's behavior effectively. However, the author was explicit in explaining their concerns and the parents refused to accommodate. \n\nThe author's decision to stop babysitting could be seen as standing up for their own well-being. If the parents are unwilling to set boundaries and the kids are out of control, it's reasonable for the babysitter to decline. The parents' response, especially the mother's, seems dismissive and possibly unreasonable. The family's criticism that a stranger shouldn't discipline the kids might be based on outdated or overly protective views. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by taking disciplinary action without prior agreement. But given that the parents didn't provide any alternative strategies and then blamed the babysitter for not handling things, the author's stance could be justified. The parents' lack of action in the face of problematic behavior is a significant factor here.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their needs and set boundaries when their well-being was at risk. The parents' failure to address the children's behavior and the family's misunderstanding of the babysitter's role contribute to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
