(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to babysit because the parents don't allow discipline. The author had a bad experience with their cousins, tried to discipline them, and the parents didn't support that. Now they're facing backlash from family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author tried to manage the kids' behavior by taking away dessert after they didn't clean up. The parents didn't want any discipline, just to ask the kids to stop. The author felt it was impossible to handle without discipline, so they quit. The parents are now complaining that the author was too harsh and turning family against them. The author is confused because they thought their approach was reasonable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the perspectives. On one hand, the parents have the final say on how their kids are raised. As a babysitter, the author might be expected to follow the parents' rules. If the parents don't allow discipline, the author should not impose their own methods. However, the kids were being really disruptive, even aggressive. The parents might not be providing clear boundaries, leading to the kids acting out. \n\nBut the author did try to follow the parents' instructions initially, then took disciplinary action when the kids didn't comply. The parents then said they don't discipline, so the author felt it was impossible to manage. It's a conflict between the babysitter's need to maintain control and the parents' parenting style.\n\nIn such cases, the babysitter is supposed to follow the parents' guidelines. If the guidelines don't allow discipline, the babysitter can't just decide to impose their own. However, if the kids are being abusive (like hitting), the babysitter might have a duty to report or stop the service. But the author did try to communicate their concerns, but the parents weren't cooperative. \n\nThe author's refusal to continue might be justified because they can't provide care in a safe environment. However, the way they handled it (witholding dessert) might be seen as going against the parents' wishes, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, the author's actions are a bit of a gray area. They had valid concerns about the kids' behavior, but didn't follow the parents' rules. The family's reaction might be harsh, but the parents do have the right to set their own rules. Therefore, the author might be in the right for not continuing, but perhaps in the wrong for not adhering to the parents' initial instructions. However, the parents' lack of discipline is also an issue. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they prioritized their well-being and safety, especially if the kids were being abusive. But some might argue they should have followed the parents' rules regardless. However, given the parents' refusal to establish boundaries, the author's decision to stop is reasonable.\n"
