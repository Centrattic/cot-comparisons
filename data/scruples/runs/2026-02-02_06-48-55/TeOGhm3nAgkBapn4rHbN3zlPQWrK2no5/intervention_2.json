(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a babysitter for their cousins, who are 4, 7, and 9 years old. They mention that the kids become unruly after a few sessions and that the parents know the kids are misbehaving. The author tried disciplining them by taking away dessert when they didn't clean up, which led to a fit from the middle child. The parents told the author not to discipline the kids and just to ask them to stop or call if something bad happens. The author then decided to stop babysitting because they couldn't handle the kids without being able to discipline them. Now the parents are complaining to the family, and others are taking the parents' side, saying it's not a babysitter's job to discipline.\n\nThe author is asking if they were in the wrong. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, let me consider the role of a babysitter. Typically, a babysitter's role is to supervise and ensure the children's safety. Discipline can be a tricky area because it often depends on the parents' preferences. The parents here explicitly told the author not to discipline the children, so the author's actions\u2014like taking away dessert\u2014might be seen as overstepping. However, the author felt that without some form of discipline, the children's behavior was unmanageable, leading to a breakdown in the situation.\n\nThe parents have a right to set their own boundaries for discipline. If they don't want the babysitter to implement consequences, the babysitter should adhere to those rules. The author didn't agree with the parents' approach and felt it was necessary to impose their own, which led to conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a valid point in that the children's behavior is extremely problematic, and without any disciplinary measures, the babysitter's ability to manage the situation is compromised. However, the responsibility for setting house rules and discipline methods lies with the parents. The author's decision to stop babysitting after the parents clarified their wishes could be seen as a reasonable choice to prioritize their own well-being, but the way they handled the situation\u2014like taking away dessert without permission\u2014might have been the initial issue.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author respected the parents' boundaries. The parents said not to discipline, so the author's actions of taking away dessert and then continuing to refuse after the parents clarified their stance might be seen as following through on their own judgment rather than the parents'. However, once the parents communicated their expectations, the author had the right to decline the babysitting if those expectations made the job unmanageable for them. The conflict arises from the author acting outside the parents' instructions before they clarified, and then following up with a refusal after clarification, which the parents and family disapprove of.\n\nSo, the author might have made a mistake by disciplining without the parents' approval first. Once the parents set their rules, the author could have either agreed to follow them or declined the babysitting from the start. Continuing after the initial discipline incident but then quitting when the parents clarified their stance might not be the wrong, but the initial action of disciplining without permission could be seen as overstepping. However, the author's main issue is that they felt the parents' approach was ineffective. It's a conflict between the babysitter's needs and the parents' rules. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parents have the authority to set discipline rules, and the author should have adhered to them from the start. By taking matters into their own hands, the author might have breached the parents' trust. However, the author's decision to stop babysitting after the parents clarified their stance is their right, especially if the job is causing them stress and the parents are unwilling to provide necessary support. The family's reaction might stem from cultural or generational views on discipline, where they believe only parents should discipline children. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author could be in the wrong for initially disciplining without permission, but also not in the wrong for setting boundaries when the parents' approach made the job untenable. The main issue is the initial disciplinary action before the parents had a chance to set their rules. However, once the parents clarified their stance, the author had the right to decline. The answer might hinge on whether the initial action was a breach, but the final decision to stop was their right. The family's disapproval might not mean the author was wrong, but the approach taken might have been misjudged.\n"
