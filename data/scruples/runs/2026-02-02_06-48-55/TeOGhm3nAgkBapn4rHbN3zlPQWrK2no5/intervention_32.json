(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about babysitting their cousins and a conflict over discipline. The author says they refused to babysit because the parents didn't allow any discipline. The kids were really misbehaving, and when the author tried to take away dessert as a consequence, the parents didn't support that. The author ended the babysitting arrangement because they couldn't handle the kids' behavior and the lack of discipline. Now the family is turning against them, saying it's not a babysitter's role to discipline.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The parents might believe that discipline is their responsibility and that the babysitter isn't authorized to impose rules. On the other hand, the author might feel that without the ability to manage the kids' behavior, it's impossible to provide safe and effective care. The author's actions could be seen as necessary for their own well-being and the children's safety, especially if the kids are being harmful or unmanageable.\n\nBut the parents might see the author's decision to remove dessert as overstepping their role. The parents might have specific methods they prefer, and the author acting without prior agreement could disrupt the household rules. The author's approach of not disciplining might lead to chaos, but the parents might not want any external influence on their parenting style.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and communication. The author could have discussed their concerns earlier with the parents about how to handle discipline, perhaps setting clear expectations before agreeing to babysit. By not doing so, the author might have assumed a role that the parents didn't assign. However, the parents' refusal to allow any form of discipline might also be unrealistic, as managing children often requires some structure.\n\nThe family's reaction is also a factor. If the author's actions led to a breakdown in the babysitting arrangement, but they communicated their reasons respectfully, maybe the fault isn't entirely on them. The parents might be at fault for not providing clear guidelines and then blaming the babysitter for not enforcing their rules.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a debate about the role of a babysitter. Some might agree that discipline should be left to the parents, while others argue that a sitter needs some authority to manage behavior. The author's refusal to continue might be justified if the situation was unsafe or unsustainable for them.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. They had valid concerns about the kids' behavior and their own ability to handle it. However, perhaps they could have handled the initial conflict better, like discussing the need for discipline beforehand. But given that the parents were clear about not allowing it, the author's decision to step back could be seen as reasonable.\n"
