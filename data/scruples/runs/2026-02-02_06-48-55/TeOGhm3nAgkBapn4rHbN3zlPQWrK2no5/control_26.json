(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit because the parents don't allow any discipline. The author described a situation where the kids were really misbehaving, and when they tried to implement some discipline (like taking away dessert), the parents didn't support it and even got upset. Now the family is turning against the author, saying that babysitters shouldn't discipline kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The parents explicitly told the author not to discipline the children, but the kids were being extremely difficult, even aggressive. The author tried to enforce some rules to maintain order but was overruled by the parents. The parents then blamed the author for being too strict.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author was justified in refusing to babysit again under those conditions. The parents are responsible for setting the rules, but if their lack of discipline leads to an unmanageable situation, the babysitter might have a right to set boundaries for their own well-being. The author did explain their concerns and tried to comply but couldn't handle the situation without some authority to manage the kids. The parents' reaction was to badmouth the author, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that a babysitter's role is to follow the parents' instructions, even if they're strict. If the parents don't allow any discipline, the babysitter might have to either accept that or decline the job. The author did try to communicate their limits, so they're not entirely at fault. The parents, however, may be in the wrong for not providing reasonable guidelines that allow the babysitter to manage the children effectively.\n\nAlso, the author's actions seem respectful\u2014they tried to explain their position calmly and left when it wasn't resolved. The parents' response was to lash out and spread negative comments. The family's support for the parents might stem from traditional views that babysitters shouldn't discipline, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The author's health and safety (especially with the kids hitting and being aggressive) are valid concerns.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They set clear boundaries for their own sanity and safety, and the parents didn't handle the situation appropriately. The answer should be B.\n"
