(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a person who refused to babysit their distant relatives because the parents didn't allow them to discipline the kids. The author argues that the kids were very misbehaved, and when they tried to enforce discipline (like taking away dessert), the parents didn't support it and instead blamed the author. Now the parents are complaining, and family members are taking the parents' side, saying that a babysitter shouldn't be allowed to discipline the children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They think the author is in the wrong. Let me unpack why. The user might believe that as a babysitter, even a relative, the person should follow the parents' rules. If the parents say not to discipline the kids, then the babysitter's job is just to supervise and not to enforce rules. The user might think that the author overstepped by taking away dessert without the parents' approval, leading to conflict. The parents could see this as the babysitter making unilateral decisions, which isn't acceptable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's side is that the children were being extremely difficult, even to the point of being abusive (insulting, trying to hit). The author tried to manage the situation within their own means but found that the parents weren't supporting any form of discipline. The author then decided to stop babysitting to protect their well-being, which might be seen as reasonable if the environment was harmful. However, the problem arises when the author took disciplinary actions (like denying dessert) without explicit permission from the parents. That could be a breach of trust or an overstepping of their role.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the author have the authority to discipline the children without the parents' consent? 2) Was the author justified in refusing to continue babysitting under those conditions? 3) How do cultural or family norms play into this? The user mentions that family members are taking the parents' side, implying a cultural norm that strangers shouldn't discipline children.\n\nMost family members might believe that the babysitter's role is to keep the kids safe and entertained, not to enforce discipline. So, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping. However, if the children's behavior was dangerous or abusive, the author has a right to protect themselves. The conflict arises from differing expectations. \n\nThe author's decision to refuse further babysitting because they can't enforce discipline might be justified if the parents are unwilling to address the children's behavior. But the initial act of disciplining without permission could have been the catalyst for the parents' anger. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be entirely in the wrong if the children were being harmful. But from the parents' perspective, the author didn't follow their rules. It's a tricky situation where both sides have valid points. However, since the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong, and considering that the majority of family members disagree with the author's actions, it might lean towards the author being in the wrong for taking disciplinary actions without parental approval. However, the parents also have a responsibility to manage their children's behavior. \n\nBut according to the user's initial thought that the author is in the wrong, and considering that the parents set the rules, the answer might be A. However, if the author's actions were necessary for their own safety, maybe not. The line here is thin. Given that the author tried to handle it politely and the parents were uncooperative, the author's refusal could be justified. But the initial discipline without parent approval is problematic. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they took disciplinary actions without the parents' consent, leading to conflict. But I'm a bit conflicted because the parents didn't support any discipline at all. However, the author's role as a babysitter is to follow the parents' rules unless there's a safety issue. Since the children were being abusive, safety is a concern, so the author might not be in the wrong. Hmm. This is complicated. Maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they had a right to set boundaries for their own safety and well-being, especially if the parents wouldn't enforce discipline. The parents are at fault for not managing their children. So the author's refusal is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
