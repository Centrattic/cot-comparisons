(Majority of my extended family seems to think so)\nI first posted this on r/relationships, but the mods removed it and told me to ask here, so here it is.\n\nLast year I got to babysit my three little cousins aged 4, 7 and 9 years old  a few times. The first 2-3 times they were well behaved, because I was new, but then they really showed what little brats they can be. Let's just say I've never seen children being so naughty and mean and the parents know, since they act the  same around them. So it's defnitely not the case of oblivious parents  thinking they're raising little angels.\n\nAt first just ignoring their tantrums worked wonders. However, when their mother requests them to do some simple chores, like clean up their toys, ignoring  doesn't work. So after a particularly long argument I decided that the only way to  maintain my position is to discipline the kids and since I didn't know what the house rules on that were, I just decided that I won't get the ones who don't comply the dessert. I warned them about it, gave them 15  minutes to get to cleaning up and sat on the sofa with a book. 10  minutes later the youngest one was already done, the oldest was  reluctantly, but slowly gathering her stuff too and the middle one didn't budge, so I did not give her the dessert and did not allow her to  steal from her sisters. That caused her to throw a fit that I tried to ignore, but in the end she started insulting everyone, trying to hit me and called us (me  and her sisters) pigs for eating dessert.\n\nWhew.  Okay. Parents came home, I informed them that the middle one was behaving horribly and did not clean her room, so she did not get  dessert. I asked what ways of discipline do they use. Should I be giving  them a time-out? Anything? They looked quite  puzzled and said that they just don't do anything, so I proceeded to list all the horrible things they do to illustrate. The parents  told me to \"ask them to stop\" and if anything particularly bad happens,  call them. I should have just left then and there, but I gave the  children a few more chances, which they blew. So I told the parents that  I unfortunately cannot contain the kids, will most likely kill them if I  see them touch the cat again (which they're tormenting all the time) and for my own sanity and out of respect for  their \\[lack of\\] house rules I have to stop babysitting them.\n\nAnd, surprise, surprise, the mother threw an adult version of a fit her child does. I really made an effort to explain how I felt in a respectful way, put an emphasis on how they do not want me to discipline  the children, so I won't go against their wishes, but I also cannot put  up with how naughty they are. She started huffing, told me that I know  nothing, because I'm a child myself and that if I were in her shoes I  would have other matters to worry about. So I said \"okay, suit  yourselves\" and bid them farewell.\n\nNow  it's been a few months since that event and their mother called me  again, pretending like nothing happened, and asked me to babysit for  them again. So I calmly reminded her, that no, I do not intend to take  care of her children unless I am allowed to control their behavior. She  got really mad, pretty much repeated that I know nothing about kids and  hung up. Now I'm learning that she's calling our family members and  complaining about how awful I am and a lot of family members take her side, saying that it's not a babysitter's (or any stranger's) place to discipline the child. So, was I right or misguided to act the way I did? I know that the mother is an asshole herself, that much doesn't need confirmation, but the shocking amount of cousins who approach me and flat out tell me that since I am not the parent, I cannot even put the kids in time-out really confuses me.\n\n**Short version: Distant family members asked me to babysit their very misbehaving  children, but forbid me to disciplining them in any way. I refused to  babysit them under such conditions and now they're turning the family  against me, because apparently I didn't handle the situation well. Apparently many of my (elderly) family members are actually against me, because supposedly the rule is \"a stranger is never allowed to discipline one's children\", which sounds ridiculous to me. So, what  do you think? AMTA?**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they were in the wrong for refusing to babysit because the parents didn't allow discipline. The kids were really misbehaving, and when they tried to enforce some rules (like taking away dessert for not cleaning up), the parents didn't support it and even got upset. Now the parents are badmouthing them to the family, and others think the author was wrong to not just follow the parents' wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a babysitter, which is a role where they're expected to manage the kids under the parents' guidelines. The parents explicitly said they don't want the kids disciplined, so when the author took it upon themselves to enforce a rule (dessert), that might have overstepped. But the kids were being really difficult, and the parents seem permissive. The author felt they couldn't handle it without being able to discipline.\n\nThe key point is whether a babysitter is allowed to enforce some form of discipline if the parents don't permit it. In most cases, babysitters follow the parents' rules. If the parents said not to discipline, the author might have acted outside their role. However, there's a balance here\u2014ensuring safety and some level of manageability. The author did warn the parents about the behavior and tried to communicate their position, but the parents were dismissive.\n\nThe family's reaction is also a factor. The parents called the author an \"asshole\" and turned the family against them. That's on the parents. But the question is about the author's actions. The author had the right to set boundaries, especially if the situation was unmanageable. However, the initial decision to take away dessert without the parents' approval might have been the problem. Proper procedure would be to communicate with the parents first about the behavior and get their input before taking disciplinary action. The author tried that but wasn't given the authority, so they had to make a call. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parents' behavior is questionable, the author might have overstepped by taking disciplinary action without clear consent. However, refusing to babysit due to unmanageable conditions is a reasonable choice. The answer hinges on whether following the parents' rules is mandatory, which it usually is in a babysitting scenario. So, the author might be seen as in the right for setting boundaries but in the wrong for not adhering strictly to the parents' instructions.\n"
