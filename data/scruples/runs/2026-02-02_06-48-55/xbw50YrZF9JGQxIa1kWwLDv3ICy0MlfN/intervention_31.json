We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left his girlfriend at 4:30 AM because they couldn't sleep due to the cat. The girlfriend cried after he left, feeling disappointed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author needed sleep because he worked late and had to wake up early. The cat was causing disturbances, and the GF insisted on staying to care for the cat. The GF might feel hurt that he left, even though she understood the reason. \n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to get some rest but couldn't. Leaving to get sleep might have been necessary for his well-being. However, communication is key here. Did he explain his need clearly? Did he try other solutions first, like moving to another room? Also, asking her to come with him but she refused\u2014maybe he could have found another way to support her, like staying with her and trying to find a compromise.\n\nThe GF's crying suggests she felt abandoned, which is a valid emotional response. Relationships require balance between individual needs and the relationship's health. Maybe the author could have handled the situation more thoughtfully, acknowledging her feelings and finding a solution that respects both their needs. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He had a valid reason, but the way he left might have hurt her feelings. Maybe he should have tried to stay and help her manage the situation, or at least communicated better to reassure her. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because his actions, while understandable, neglected her emotional needs in the moment. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if his need for sleep was critical. But the emotional impact on the GF is significant. I think leaning towards A because the situation could have been handled with more consideration for her feelings.\n"
