We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his girlfriend to get some sleep when they had a cat issue.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together two months. They're staying at her apartment because her parents left, and the cat is causing trouble. The girl can fall asleep again, but the guy can't. He leaves to get sleep, and later finds out she was upset.\n\nThe question is if he's at fault. \n\nHmm. On one hand, the guy had a long workday and needed rest. Leaving for a few hours to get sleep might be seen as a reasonable decision for his health. He did offer to take her with him, but she stayed for the cat. \n\nBut the girlfriend felt hurt and cried, seeing it as him bailing. In a new relationship, communication and emotional support are important. Maybe the guy didn't consider how leaving might affect her emotionally. He might have acted without fully understanding her feelings of responsibility towards the cat and the situation's stress. \n\nHowever, his intention was to get rest so he could function. It's a tough balance between personal needs and relationship dynamics. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say he's not wrong because he needed to take care of himself, while others might think he should have found another solution before leaving.\n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He made a choice to prioritize his health, but he could have handled the communication better. The girlfriend's feelings are valid too, but maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) since his actions had a valid reason and he tried to solve the problem by leaving. But others might argue he should have stayed. However, given the context, I think the answer leans towards B.\n"
