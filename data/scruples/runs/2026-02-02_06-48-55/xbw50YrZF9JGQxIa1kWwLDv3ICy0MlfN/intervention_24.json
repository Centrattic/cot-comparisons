We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question left their girlfriend to get some sleep because the cat was keeping them awake. They had to work the next morning and couldn't rest. The girlfriend felt hurt because she thought they bailed out on her during a tough time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for sleep is valid, especially after working late and needing to be up early. They tried to stay but couldn't rest. The girlfriend was used to handling the cat, but the situation was new for the author. However, the girlfriend felt abandoned, which is a big emotional issue. \n\nCommunication seems key here. Maybe the author could have talked more about their exhaustion before leaving, but they did ask her to come with them. She chose to stay with the cat. The author's action was self-care, but it might have been perceived as not supporting their partner. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They made a choice based on their needs, but didn't consider how it would affect the GF emotionally. Maybe they should have found a different solution, like staying up or finding a way to manage the cat's behavior. But leaving to get rest isn't inherently wrong. The GF's reaction is also about feeling unsupported. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement in handling the situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with the note that communication could have been better.\n"
