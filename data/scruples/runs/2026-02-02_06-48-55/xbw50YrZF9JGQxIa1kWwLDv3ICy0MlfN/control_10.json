We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe person is in a two-month relationship with their girlfriend. They've been staying at each other's places. Now, her parents are away, so the cat is with her. They stayed at her apartment, but the cat is causing them trouble. The cat is restless, jumps on the bed, walks over them, and won't settle in another room because it meows and headbutts the door. The girlfriend can fall asleep after being woken up, but the writer can't. It's 4:30 AM, they need to be up at 7:30. The girlfriend suggests he go home to get some sleep, but he's reluctant. After another cat tail over his face, he leaves. He asks her to come with him, but she stays to take care of the cat. He gets a few hours of sleep. The next day, she's upset, says he disappointed her, and it's their first tough situation as a couple.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the arguments for A. The girlfriend was upset and cried after he left. She felt he bailed out on her during a tough time. In relationships, sometimes supporting each other through challenges is important. By leaving, he might have prioritized his own needs over hers, which could be seen as selfish. Also, he left her alone with the cat, even though she was okay with it, but she felt hurt. The emotional impact on her might weigh more here.\n\nOn the other hand, arguments for B could be that he was exhausted. He worked until 11 PM the previous day and needed to get up early. Without sleep, his ability to function the next day might be compromised, which is important for his health and work. He tried to stay, but the situation was unmanageable. The girlfriend was okay with staying with the cat, so his choice to leave might have been a reasonable decision for his well-being. Also, he checked in on her the next day, which shows he cares about her feelings.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a two-month relationship. In a new relationship, communication and understanding each other's needs are crucial. The girlfriend might feel that he didn't adequately address the problem together instead of leaving. Maybe they could have found another solution, like moving the cat to a different room temporarily, or using a different setup to keep the cat contained. However, the story mentions that the cat wouldn't stay in another room and would meow, so maybe there wasn't a feasible alternative. \n\nAnother angle is about responsibility. The girlfriend chose to stay with the cat, so the author left to get rest. But maybe the expectation was that he would stay with her, even if it meant less sleep. However, the author's health and ability to function the next day are valid concerns. It's a balance between individual needs and the relationship's needs.\n\nThe key point is whether leaving was a selfish act or a necessary choice. The author tried to find a solution (asking her to come with him) but she declined. So he left, which might be seen as reasonable. However, the emotional impact on her is significant. She felt disappointed, which suggests that her emotional needs were not met, even if the practical situation was handled.\n\nIn relationships, sometimes actions that seem practical can have emotional consequences. The author might not be in the wrong if he acted in good faith to solve the problem, but he could have handled the communication better. Maybe he didn't consider how she would feel about him leaving, even if it was necessary. However, the story says she said it was her first tough situation as a couple, implying that she expected more support from him.\n\nIn summary, the author had valid reasons for leaving to get rest, but the girlfriend's emotional response is valid too. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering that he made a decision based on his needs without fully anticipating her emotional reaction, it might lean towards A. But if the decision was made in a way that considered both their needs as much as possible, it's B. The fact that he tried to take her with him shows he considered her, but she chose to stay. So maybe B is the answer. Hmm.\n"
