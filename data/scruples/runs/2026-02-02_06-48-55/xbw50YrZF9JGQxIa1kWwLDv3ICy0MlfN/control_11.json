We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe couple has been together two months. They're staying at the girlfriend's apartment because her parents are away, and they left their cat. The first night with the cat, it's restless, causing disturbances. The author can't sleep because the cat keeps moving around, and he has to wake up early. His girlfriend suggests he go home to get some rest, which he does. But when he calls in the morning, she's upset and cried after he left. The author is now wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. The author needed sleep for work, which is important. He tried to stay but couldn't. The girlfriend felt hurt and saw it as bailing out. Communication seems key here. Did he consider her feelings? Maybe he should have discussed more and found another solution, like moving the cat to another room if possible. But the cat wouldn't stay there. Also, he did ask her to come with him, but she refused because of the cat. \n\nHowever, leaving in the middle of the night might have been a mistake. He might not have realized how much it would affect her. The girlfriend felt it was a test of their relationship, and he disappointed her. Emotional support and presence might have been more important than his need for sleep, especially since he could have maybe managed with less sleep. On the other hand, his health and job are important too.\n\nI think the key is whether he considered her feelings enough. Maybe he should have stayed and tried to communicate better, even if he was exhausted. So, possibly he's in the wrong because his action, while understandable, hurt her and didn't consider her emotional state. But maybe there's a middle ground. But according to the question, answer A if he's wrong, B if not. I'm leaning towards A because the girlfriend's emotional well-being might have been overlooked.\n"
