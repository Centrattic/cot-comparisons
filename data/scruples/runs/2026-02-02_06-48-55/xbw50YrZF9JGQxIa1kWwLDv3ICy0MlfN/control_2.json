We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about leaving their girlfriend to get some sleep because the cat was causing disturbances. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. They've been together two months, staying at each other's places. Now, the girlfriend's parents are away, so the cat is there. The first night, the cat is restless, and they can't leave it in another room because it meows and headbutts the door. The guy is exhausted from work, needs to get up early, and the girlfriend suggests he go home for sleep. He hesitates but leaves, and later finds out she cried because she felt he bailed on her.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the guy had a legitimate reason\u2014he was tired and needed to rest. Leaving might have been to fulfill his own needs, which is understandable. But on the other hand, his girlfriend felt hurt and that he didn't support her during a tough time. The question is whether his actions were wrong.\n\nI should consider both sides. The cat issue was a known problem, and the girlfriend was handling it, but he left her alone. Maybe he could have tried other solutions first, like taking the cat with him or finding a temporary place for it. But the problem was that the cat couldn't be left alone. Also, he did ask her to come with him, but she refused. So he had to make a choice between his health and staying. \n\nBut the emotional impact on her is significant. She cried and felt disappointed. Relationships often require compromise. Maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. However, he did check in with her after. \n\nReddit users often look at communication and intentions. Did he communicate his needs clearly? He did. Did she understand? Maybe, but she still felt hurt. The problem is that in a new relationship, expectations are still being set. He left without fully considering how it might affect her. \n\nSo, while he had a valid reason, the way he handled it might have been inconsiderate. He could have tried to find another solution. Alternatively, maybe it's not his fault because he prioritized his health. But the crying suggests emotional harm. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because even though he had a reason, his action hurt her feelings and he didn't fully consider her perspective. The cat issue was a temporary problem, but the emotional impact is longer. So maybe he should have stayed to support her even if he couldn't sleep. But I'm not sure. Wait, he did try to get her to come with him, but she refused. So he had no choice but to leave. Hmm. It's a tough call. \n\nSome people might say B because he needed to rest, others A because he left her alone. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the cat's presence was a known issue, maybe he should have addressed it differently. Maybe he could have stayed and tried to help her manage the cat. But the problem is the cat can't be left alone. So he left to get sleep, which is necessary for his job. \n\nI think the answer is A because he left her alone during a difficult time, which hurt her feelings. The fact that she cried indicates that his action had a negative impact on their relationship. Even if he had his reasons, the emotional aspect is important. So the answer is A.\n"
