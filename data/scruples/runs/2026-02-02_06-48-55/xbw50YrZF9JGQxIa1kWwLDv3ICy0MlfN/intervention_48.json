We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left his girlfriend at 4:30 AM because they couldn't sleep due to the cat. He needed to get up early for work. She felt hurt and cried after he left, thinking he bailed on her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author had a valid reason: he was exhausted, worked late, and needed sleep. The cat was causing disruption, and his girlfriend offered the solution to go home. But leaving might have been seen as abandoning her during a tough time, even if she said she couldn't come with him. \n\nThe girlfriend's feelings are important here. She might have felt that he didn't support her, even though she understood the need for sleep. The key points are communication and understanding. Did the author explain his needs clearly? He did ask her to come, and she declined. So maybe he had no choice. But maybe he could have tried other solutions first, like moving the cat to another room temporarily or using a different sleeping arrangement. \n\nAlso, the emotional impact is significant. She was upset the next morning. The author might not have considered how his leaving would affect her emotionally. Even if he had to leave, maybe he could have stayed a bit longer or left a message to reassure her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's health and responsibilities are valid. He needed rest for work. The situation was a first-time problem with the cat. The girlfriend's responsibility to care for the cat is mutual, but maybe they could have shared the burden. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He did what he thought was necessary for his well-being, but didn't anticipate her emotional reaction. Maybe he should have discussed it more or ensured she felt supported. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be a bit hypersensitive. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were considerate of her feelings. Since he left without considering her emotional state, even if he had a reason, he might be at fault. But the situation is complex. I'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong, because he should have considered her feelings more and maybe found another way to handle the situation.\n"
