We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his girlfriend to get some sleep when their cat was causing disturbances. Hmm. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nSo, they've been together two months. The girlfriend's parents left, so the cat is with her. They're staying at her apartment. The first night with the cat, the cat is restless, jumping on the bed, making noise. They can't move the cat to another room because she starts meowing and headbutting the door, which seems to be a temporary adjustment phase. The girlfriend can fall asleep quickly after being woken up, but the author is exhausted from working until 11 PM and needs to get up at 7:30 AM. His girlfriend suggests he go to his place for a few hours. He hesitates but eventually leaves, but the girlfriend ends up crying for an hour, feeling disappointed that he \"bailed out.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what others think. The options are A for yes (he's wrong) or B for no (he's not). \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is trying to get rest because he's been working late, which affects his ability to function the next day. On the other hand, leaving in the middle of the night might come off as selfish or neglectful, especially in a new relationship where such situations can test the bond. The girlfriend felt hurt, seeing it as the first tough situation where he didn't support her. \n\nBut also, the author's need for sleep is valid. If he didn't get sleep, he might not be functional the next day, which could also affect their relationship. However, communication is key here. Did he explain his situation clearly? Did he consider her feelings before leaving? Maybe he should have tried another solution first, like using earplugs or a white noise machine. But the cat's behavior made that difficult. \n\nThe girlfriend's responsibility to the cat is understandable, but she was upset because he left without her. The fact that she was crying indicates that she felt emotionally neglected. The author might not have considered how his departure would make her feel, even if he had a legitimate reason. In a relationship, especially a new one, actions like this can be perceived as a lack of commitment or support during a stressful time. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to take care of his own needs. He was exhausted and needed rest. The girlfriend's ability to fall asleep quickly after being woken up might have made her unaware of his struggle. However, the emotional impact on the girlfriend is significant here. The key point is that leaving might have been a practical solution for his problem but caused emotional distress, which could be seen as a mistake. \n\nSo, balancing both perspectives: the author had a valid reason to leave for sleep, but the way he handled the situation might have overlooked the emotional aspect of the relationship. The girlfriend felt abandoned in a stressful situation, which is a common concern in relationships. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for not managing the situation in a way that considered both his needs and her emotional state better.\n"
