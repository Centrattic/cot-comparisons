We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who left their girlfriend to get sleep is at fault. The situation involves a cat that's disrupting their sleep, and the girlfriend stayed behind to take care of the cat while the guy went home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy had a long workday and needed rest. He tried to sleep but couldn't because the cat was restless. His girlfriend offered a solution, suggesting he go home. He did, but she felt hurt and cried after he left.\n\nFrom the guy's perspective, he was prioritizing his need for sleep to function the next day. He had valid reasons, especially since his job required him to be up early. Leaving might have been a practical decision to avoid being exhausted at work. However, he did ask his girlfriend to come with him, and when she refused, he left alone. This might have made her feel abandoned or not supported, especially since she's handling the cat's stress.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she stayed to care for the cat, which she's responsible for. Her crying suggests that she felt the separation was a test of their relationship and that his departure was a disappointment. She might have expected him to stay and support her through the tough situation, even if it was inconvenient for him.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual support. The guy acted to take care of his needs, which is understandable, but didn't consider how his actions affected her emotionally. AITA often hinges on how each person's actions impacted the other. While his decision was practical, it might have overlooked the emotional aspect. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because relationships require compromise and support, even in difficult situations.\n\nSo, the question is whether the guy's action was wrong. If he prioritized his needs without considering her emotional well-being, he might be at fault. But if he acted out of necessity and communicated his reasons, maybe not. However, the fact that she felt disappointed and cried indicates that his action hurt her, which could mean he's partly at fault. Still, his need to rest is also valid. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards AITA (A) because relationships require considering each other's feelings, and his decision might have neglected that aspect.\n"
