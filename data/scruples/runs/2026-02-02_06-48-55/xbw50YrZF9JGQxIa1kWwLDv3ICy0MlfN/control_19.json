We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who left their girlfriend to get sleep is in the wrong. The situation is that they're staying at her apartment because her parents left their cat there. The cat is causing them to lose sleep by being restless and making noise. The girlfriend manages to fall asleep quickly when disturbed, but the guy can't. At 4:30 AM, he leaves to get some rest, and she ends up crying because she felt he bailed on her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy worked late and needs to be up early, so his lack of sleep could affect his job or health. On the other hand, the girlfriend felt hurt that he left, even though she stayed to care for the cat. \n\nFactors to consider: communication before leaving, whether he tried all possible solutions to stay, if there were alternatives. Did he ask her to come with him, but she refused? Maybe he could have tried other ways to sleep, like earplugs or a different room. But the cat was in the same room, so moving to another room might not help. Also, the cat's behavior might have been a temporary issue, so maybe he could have just stayed and dealt with it. \n\nBut the key point is that he left in the middle of the night. Even if he had a valid reason, not discussing it more or leaving without a clear plan might have caused her distress. Emotional support in tough situations is important for relationships. She might have felt abandoned, even if he had good reasons. \n\nHowever, his need for sleep is also valid. If he's exhausted, his health and ability to function the next day matter. The problem is the balance between personal needs and the emotional impact on the partner. The fact that she was upset suggests that leaving was a hurtful action from her perspective. \n\nMaybe the right approach would have been to talk more, find a compromise, or ensure she felt supported. Leaving without considering her emotional response might be seen as selfish, even if his intention was to get rest. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings adequately, but there's a case for B since his need for sleep is understandable. The Reddit community often looks at intentions and communication. Since he left without resolving the issue and caused emotional distress, the answer leans towards A.\n"
