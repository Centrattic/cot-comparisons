We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his girlfriend to get some sleep when they had a restless cat.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together two months. The girlfriend's parents left, so they're staying at her apartment. The cat is acting up, not settling. The guy is exhausted, needs sleep, and leaves to get some rest. The girlfriend is upset because she felt he bailed on her.\n\nSo, the main points here are the guy's need for sleep versus the girlfriend's emotional response. The guy left because he couldn't sleep, but the girlfriend felt hurt and cried. \n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Now, I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the guy worked late and needed sleep. He tried to stay but couldn't. Leaving might have been a practical decision for his health. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt abandoned, especially since she's new to the relationship and this was a \"tough situation.\"\n\nCommunication is key here. Maybe the guy didn't consider how his leaving would make her feel. He asked her to come, but she declined, so maybe he could have tried to comfort her instead of leaving suddenly. Also, the fact that she cried afterward shows the emotional impact.\n\nBut he had a valid reason for needing sleep. However, relationships often require compromise. Maybe there was a middle ground, like staying up for a while longer, or trying to comfort the cat together. The guy's action was practical but might have lacked emotional consideration.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of both. He had a reason, but the way he handled it might have hurt her feelings without realizing how important that situation was to her. So maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong.\n"
