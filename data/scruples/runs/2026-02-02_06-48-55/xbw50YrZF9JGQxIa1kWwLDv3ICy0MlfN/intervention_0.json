We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe couple has been together two months. They're staying at the girlfriend's apartment because her parents left, and they have the cat. The first night with the cat, it's restless, making noise, and the author can't sleep. The girlfriend suggests he go home for sleep since he needs to get up early. He leaves, she stays to take care of the cat. The next morning, she's upset and says he disappointed her because it was their first tough situation as a couple.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to leave. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He was exhausted, worked late, needed sleep. The cat was a problem, and his girlfriend offered a solution. He took it, got some rest, which might have been necessary for his well-being and to function the next day. He did ask her to come with him, but she refused due to responsibility for the cat.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side: She stayed with the cat, which is her responsibility. She was upset because he left, maybe feeling abandoned or that he prioritized his sleep over her. The fact that she cried shows emotional impact. The author didn't consider the emotional aspect of his decision, possibly not communicating well or not understanding how his leaving affected her.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have made a practical decision but didn't handle the emotional part. Maybe he should have tried another solution first, like moving the cat to another room (though the story says the cat meows and won't settle there). Or maybe they could have taken turns sleeping. But the cat was a new situation, and they had to manage it.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction seems intense. Maybe she felt unappreciated or that he was avoiding the problem. The author should have considered her feelings more. Even if he needed sleep, leaving abruptly without more discussion might have been hurtful. He could have stayed and tried to manage the situation together, even if it meant less sleep for himself. Or he could have found another way to get some rest without physically leaving, like taking a short nap elsewhere.\n\nAlso, since they're a couple, supporting each other through challenges is important. If he left because he couldn't cope, maybe that's a sign of not being fully committed to working through problems together. However, he did try to take care of her by getting some sleep for the next day's responsibilities. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe key points are: Did he act selfishly or out of necessity? The girlfriend's emotional response indicates that his action hurt her, possibly because she felt he didn't support her during her responsibility. The author might not have considered the emotional implications, leading to her feeling disappointed. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on balancing practical needs with emotional support. If the author had explained his reasoning and ensured she felt supported, maybe it would be different. But leaving without considering her feelings could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
