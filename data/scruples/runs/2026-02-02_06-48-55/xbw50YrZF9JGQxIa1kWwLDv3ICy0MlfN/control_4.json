We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who left their girlfriend to get some sleep is in the wrong. The situation is that they're staying at her place because her parents are away, and there's a cat that's causing trouble. The guy couldn't sleep, so he left for a few hours after 4:30 AM. His girlfriend was upset and cried.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are communication and expectations. The guy tried to get sleep because he was tired from work. He asked her to come with him, but she stayed to take care of the cat. She felt he bailed on her, which hurt her feelings. \n\nOn one hand, he had a valid reason\u2014he needed rest for work. Leaving for a couple of hours might be understandable. But on the other hand, not considering her feelings and the situation could be seen as selfish. Maybe he didn't communicate his decision better or didn't realize how it would affect her. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt abandoned, even if it was a short time. In a new relationship (two months), trust and emotional support are important. The guy might have prioritized his own needs without thinking about her perspective. \n\nBut then again, he did mention he tried to get her to come with him. Maybe she didn't want to leave the cat, so he had no choice. However, the fact that she cried shows it was a bigger issue for her than he anticipated. Perhaps he should have stayed to support her, even if he couldn't sleep. \n\nSo, balancing both sides. Is he in the wrong? Maybe partially. He might not be entirely wrong because he had a legitimate need for sleep, but he didn't handle the situation well. The key is communication and considering her feelings. If he had discussed it more or stayed for her, even if it meant less sleep, it might have been better. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong. Because the girlfriend's emotional reaction was significant, and he didn't fully address her feelings. He left despite knowing she was upset, even if it was to get some sleep. The responsibility to support each other in a relationship is important, and his choice might have hurt her more than he realized.\n"
