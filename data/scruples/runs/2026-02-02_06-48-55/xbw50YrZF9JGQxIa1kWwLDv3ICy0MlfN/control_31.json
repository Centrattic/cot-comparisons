We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about leaving his girlfriend to sleep after being awakened by a cat. \n\nFirst, the couple is staying at her apartment because her parents are on vacation and left the cat. The cat is causing a disturbance, making him unable to sleep. He works late and needs to get up early, so he goes home for a few hours. The girlfriend cries later, feeling disappointed.\n\nHmm, so the main points here: Did he do the right thing by leaving? He needed rest for work, but his girlfriend felt hurt. \n\nOn one hand, he was being responsible by getting enough sleep to fulfill his job responsibilities. If he didn't get sleep, maybe he couldn't perform well at work. On the other hand, leaving his girlfriend alone during a stressful situation might have hurt her feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend seems to feel that he didn't support her in taking care of the cat, which she sees as her responsibility. But he was trying to take care of his own needs. \n\nBut maybe there's a communication issue here. He asked her to come with him, but she refused. So perhaps there should have been a different solution, like trying to make the room more comfortable for the cat or using earplugs or something. However, the cat's behavior is causing a problem, and they can't leave it alone. \n\nBut the key is whether he was wrong to leave. Since he needed sleep and she insisted on staying with the cat, maybe he wasn't at fault. However, leaving during the night without proper communication could be seen as abandoning her, which might explain her emotional reaction. \n\nThe question is whether his actions were selfish or necessary. If he left to take care of his health and work, it's understandable. But if he didn't consider her feelings enough, maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is a bit balanced, but since he had a valid reason to leave (work) and she had her own responsibility, he's not necessarily wrong. However, maybe he should have handled the communication better. But based on the given info, the answer might be B (not wrong) because he's prioritizing his well-being, but some might argue A because of the emotional impact. \n\nReddit responses often lean towards empathy. If the girlfriend cried, maybe the author didn't consider her feelings enough. But he had a good reason. Hmm. I need to decide based on the scenario. I think it's a bit of both, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. I might lean towards B, he's not in the wrong, because he had a valid reason to leave for his health and work, and the responsibility of the cat was hers. But the emotional impact is a factor. Maybe the answer is A because leaving her alone when she's upset could be seen as wrong. Wait, but she chose to stay with the cat. So he had no choice but to leave. \n\nI think the answer is B. He's not in the wrong because he needed to sleep for work and she couldn't leave the cat. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. So the answer is B.\n"
