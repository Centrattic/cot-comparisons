We can't leave her in another room as she starts meowing and headbutting the door. Apparently she does that the first couple of nights when she's not at her home. \nNow, my GF is somewhat used to that and she manages to fall asleep pretty fast after being woken up, but I can't get any rest. So it's 4:30 AM, I'm still awake, I worked till 11PM the day before and I need to get up at 7:30. My GF says that the cat won't settle down and if I want to get some sleep I should go to my place (about 5 min drive).\nI hesitate for a while, but anther cat tail over my face later I decide to leave. Ask my GF to come with me, but she says she has a responsibility to take care of the cat so she can't leave her alone. Get home and manage to squeeze a couple of hours of sleep.\n\nFast forward to 8AM, I call my GF and find out that she had cried for an hour after I left. She says this was the first 'tough situation' for us as a couple and I disappointed her as I bailed out.\nAITA Reddit?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left his girlfriend to get some sleep because the cat was keeping them up. The girlfriend was upset because he left her alone with the cat, which she felt was her responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author had a good reason: he was exhausted, needed sleep, and his girlfriend suggested he leave. But the girlfriend felt emotionally hurt because he left her during a tough situation. \n\nOn one hand, the author was prioritizing his health and ability to function the next day, which is important. He followed his girlfriend's suggestion, so he wasn't ignoring her advice. On the other hand, leaving might have made his girlfriend feel abandoned, especially if she was already stressed about the cat. \n\nI should think about communication. Did the author communicate his needs clearly? He asked her to come with him, but she declined. Maybe he could have stayed and tried to manage the situation together, but the cat was a problem both couldn't control. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend crying after he left shows that his action had an emotional impact. Even if it was a practical decision, he might have acted without considering how it would make her feel. \n\nIn relationships, balancing individual needs with the partner's feelings is key. The author might have been in a tough spot, but the aftermath shows that his decision caused hurt. So maybe he is partly at fault for not handling the emotional aspect better.\n"
