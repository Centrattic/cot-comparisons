I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend got suicidal over AirPods. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the friend is dealing with depression and the author has been trying to support them, which is taking a mental toll. The friend asked for AirPods as a birthday gift, but the author can't afford it. The friend got angry, made passive-aggressive comments about past gifts, and then sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The author responded by calling the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, considering the context, the friend's mental health is a significant factor. When someone is struggling with depression or suicidal ideation, their actions and reactions can be impulsive and not entirely rational. The friend's threats and self-harm might be a cry for help rather than a calculated attempt to manipulate. \n\nThe author did apologize for not being able to afford the gift, which shows they tried to be considerate. However, when the friend escalated the situation with self-harm and suicide talk, the author's response was to label them as selfish. That might not be the most supportive reaction. In such situations, it's crucial to prioritize the friend's safety and offer help rather than assigning blame, even if the friend's behavior seems manipulative.\n\nBut wait, the author was also being manipulated. The friend was using their depression and self-harm to guilt-trip the author into buying an expensive gift. The author's frustration is understandable, but responding with \"selfish\" in the moment might have been a knee-jerk reaction. The key here is whether the author's words could be seen as invalidating the friend's mental health crisis. Even if the friend's actions were manipulative, the suicide threat is serious, and the author might have needed to address that first instead of the perceived selfishness.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be justified in feeling used if the friend is leveraging their mental health for gifts. But in the heat of the moment, calling someone selfish when they're in crisis could exacerbate their feelings of worthlessness. It's a delicate balance between setting boundaries and showing empathy.\n\nIn mental health crises, people often act out of desperation, not malice. The author's response could have made the friend feel more alone, which is dangerous. The appropriate action would be to de-escalate, express concern for their safety, and perhaps suggest professional help. So, while the friend's behavior was problematic, the author's response might not have been the most helpful, making them at least partially at fault for not handling the situation with more care.\n"
