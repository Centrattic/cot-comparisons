I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has been depressed and the writer's response to a request for an expensive gift. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The friend is dealing with depression, which is serious. He asked for Airpods but the writer couldn't afford them. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, and even showed self-harm. The writer told him he was being selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nThe writer is asking if they were wrong to call the friend selfish. The key points here are the context of depression, the financial constraints of the writer, and the friend's reaction. \n\nDepression can cause people to act out in unhealthy ways. The friend's threats of suicide and self-harm are red flags that suggest he might be in crisis. However, the writer is also at their limit emotionally and financially. They tried to be apologetic but were met with anger. The writer's response of calling the friend selfish might have been a result of their own stress.\n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, calling someone selfish when they're struggling with depression could be hurtful. Even if the friend acted manipulatively, the writer might not have considered the underlying mental health issues. However, the writer is also under a lot of stress and might not have handled it well. \n\nBut in these situations, it's important to approach with empathy. The friend's threats are serious, and the writer's immediate reaction might not have considered that. The friend's actions could be a cry for help rather than manipulation. The writer's comment might have worsened the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer clearly stated their financial limits and apologized. They did try to support the friend. The friend's reaction was extreme. It's a tough call. But maybe the writer's comment was a mistake because it didn't address the friend's emotional state. Even if the friend was manipulative, the writer could have responded more compassionately. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the writer being in the wrong (A) because their response could have been insensitive given the friend's mental health. However, some might argue that the friend's behavior was the issue. But in terms of the immediate action, calling someone selfish in such a context is likely unhelpful and could be seen as dismissive of their genuine pain. Hence, A might be the answer.\n"
