I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a friend who's been depressed and another friend who's been supporting them. The key event is when the friend asks for Airpods for their birthday. The writer can't afford that, says no, and the friend gets upset, even threatening suicide. Then the writer calls the friend selfish and manipulative, and they ignore each other.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression. That's a big factor. When someone is depressed or has depression, they might react more intensely to stressors. So the friend's outburst and threats might be part of their mental health struggles. The writer mentions that the friend has been depressed for a while and that supporting them is taxing. So the writer is under a lot of pressure too.\n\nWhen the friend asks for Airpods, the writer is honest about not being able to afford it. They're apologetic, which shows they tried to handle it gently. But the friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, and makes suicide threats. The friend's response seems extreme, possibly manipulative, given the context of their previous interactions where the friend usually got what the writer asked for at lower cost.\n\nThe writer then calls the friend selfish and manipulative. That's the point of contention. The question is whether this reaction is justified. On one hand, the friend is using emotional manipulation (suicide threats) to guilt-trip the writer into buying something expensive. On the other hand, the writer might feel cornered, especially since they're already stressed from supporting the friend.\n\nBut when someone is struggling with depression, their actions can be a reflection of their mental state rather than intentional manipulation. The friend's threats might be a cry for help or a sign of their deep emotional pain. The writer's response of calling them selfish might be a reaction to feeling manipulated, but it could also be seen as not taking the friend's mental health seriously enough. The writer should probably have been more empathetic, even if they felt the friend was being manipulative. \n\nHowever, the friend's behavior does cross a line by using suicide as a threat to get what they want. That's a serious issue. The writer was in a tough spot, trying to be supportive but also having their own financial limits. The key here is whether the writer should have known the friend's mental state would lead to such a reaction. Since the friend has a history of depression, the writer might have an obligation to handle the situation more carefully, avoiding any language that could trigger a negative reaction.\n\nBut the friend's actions were inappropriate regardless of their mental health. They used extreme emotional manipulation. The writer's frustration is understandable, but calling someone selfish in the context of a mental health crisis might not be the best approach. The writer could have tried to de-escalate the situation or suggest alternative ways to celebrate the birthday without spending money. \n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's behavior was problematic, the writer's response might have been too harsh. They should have considered the friend's mental health more carefully and perhaps found another way to address the situation without dismissing the friend's feelings as selfish. So the writer might be in the wrong for not being more empathetic, but the friend also acted inappropriately. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because of the dismissive response to a friend in crisis.\n"
