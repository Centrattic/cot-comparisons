I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend selfish is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend was depressed and wanted Airpods for their birthday, but the author couldn't afford it. The friend got upset, made passive-aggressive comments, showed self-harm, and mentioned suicide. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to an ignored conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mental health aspect. The friend has been depressed and has a history of self-harm. When someone is struggling with mental health issues, their actions might be influenced by their condition. The friend's reaction could be an emotional outburst due to their depression, possibly not fully thinking through their words or actions.\n\nThe author was in a difficult position, financially strained and trying to support their friend. They were apologetic but got pushed further by the friend's comments about past gifts. The friend's comparison of past gift prices (adding an extra zero) suggests a possible exaggeration or misrepresentation, but the author's response was to label them as selfish and manipulative.\n\nCalling someone selfish during a mental health crisis might not be constructive. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author's response could have been more empathetic. Instead of labeling, maybe the author could have tried to understand the underlying distress. The friend's mention of suicide is a serious red flag that requires immediate concern, not a judgmental response.\n\nHowever, the friend's actions\u2014bringing up expensive gifts, making passive-aggressive comments, and threatening self-harm\u2014could be seen as manipulative. But given their depression, it's possible their actions are a result of their illness rather than intentional manipulation. The author's stress from supporting a depressed friend might have led to a breakdown in communication.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have some role. The friend's behavior was harmful, but the author's response was harsh. The key point is the author's use of the term \"selfish\" when the friend was in crisis. This could damage the relationship and not address the friend's real issues. The author should have prioritized the friend's well-being over the financial discussion, perhaps by offering alternatives or seeking help rather than assigning blame.\n\nSo, considering the mental health crisis, the appropriate response would involve expressing concern and seeking support rather than calling someone selfish. The author's reaction, while understandable given the stress, might have been unhelpful and contributed to the friend ignoring them. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault for not handling the situation with more empathy and support.\n"
