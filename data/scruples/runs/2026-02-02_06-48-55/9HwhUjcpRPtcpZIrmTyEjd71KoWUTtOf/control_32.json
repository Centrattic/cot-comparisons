I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and when the author can't afford to buy Airpods for his friend's birthday, the friend becomes upset and even threatens suicide. The author calls him selfish and manipulative, then the friend ignores him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of depression, which is a serious mental health issue. The author has been supporting him, which is commendable, but now feels pressured to buy an expensive gift he can't afford. The friend's reaction seems extreme, using passive-aggressive comments and even self-harm threats. \n\nThe author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative. Is that justified? Well, the friend is using emotional manipulation by bringing up past gifts (which were cheap) and then threatening self-harm to guilt-trip the author into buying something expensive. The author was honest about not being able to afford it and apologized, which is reasonable. However, responding with \"selfish and manipulative\" might be harsh, even if true. It's possible the friend was in a vulnerable state and the author's words could have exacerbated the situation. \n\nBut then again, the friend's behavior is also problematic. Using suicide threats as a tactic to get what they want is manipulative. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially financially. However, the way the author communicated this might have been harsh given the friend's mental state. Maybe a more empathetic approach could have been better, even if the friend's actions were manipulative.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might have been right to set a boundary but could have handled it more sensitively. However, the friend's actions were clearly manipulative. In the AITA context, the community often looks at who acted unreasonably. The friend's threats and passive-aggressive behavior are definitely in the wrong. The author's response, while maybe a bit direct, was in response to manipulation. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The key points are the friend's history of depression and the use of self-harm threats as leverage. The author was honest and apologetic but used strong language. However, the friend's actions were more harmful. So probably the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
