I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is between the author and their friend. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been trying to support them, even though it's taxing them mentally. On the friend's birthday, the author can't afford an expensive gift like Airpods. The friend gets upset, passive-aggressive, mentions past gifts (which were cheaper), and starts sending pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author then calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, the friend's mental health is a big factor. They've been depressed and have a history of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The author is in a difficult position because they want to support the friend but also can't afford expensive gifts. However, when the friend brings up self-harm and suicide, that's a serious red flag. The author's response was to call them selfish and manipulative, which seems harsh, especially when the friend is in emotional distress. \n\nBut wait, the friend is using emotional manipulation by bringing up self-harm to guilt-trip the author into getting the Airpods. That's a problem. The author might feel they're being taken advantage of. However, when someone is in crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts, the appropriate response is to take it seriously and offer support, not confront them with labels like selfishness. \n\nThe author did apologize for not being able to afford the Airpods, but the friend's reaction escalated. The author's response of calling them selfish might have been a reaction to feeling manipulated. But in a situation where a friend is threatening self-harm, the priority should be their safety. The author should have de-escalated the situation, maybe tried to get them to talk to someone professional, or reached out to others for help. \n\nHowever, the author was already stressed from supporting the friend and might have snapped. The question is whether calling the friend selfish was the wrong move. It could have made the friend feel more isolated and hurt, potentially worsening their mental state. So, even if the friend was being manipulative, the author's response might not have been appropriate given the context of the friend's mental health issues. \n\nBut there's also the aspect that the friend is manipulating and using self-harm as a tactic. The author might feel justified in setting boundaries. However, in such sensitive situations, the line between standing up for yourself and being harsh is thin. The author should probably have addressed the manipulation without dismissing the friend's emotional state. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the friend has a history of depression and self-harm, the author is in a tough spot financially, but the author's response of calling the friend selfish might have been unhelpful and potentially harmful during a crisis. The author should have handled it more carefully, maybe by reaffirming their support while setting financial boundaries without attacking the friend's character. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their response, even if the friend's actions were manipulative.\n"
