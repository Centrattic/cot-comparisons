I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's been depressed, and the author called him selfish after he got suicidal over not getting Airpods. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend has been struggling with depression for a while, and the author has been supporting him, which is taking a toll mentally. On the friend's birthday, he wants Airpods, but the author can't afford them. The friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, brings up past gifts (which were cheaper), and then starts sending pictures of self-harm and mentions suicide.\n\nThe author responds by calling him selfish and manipulative. Then the friend ignores them. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the friend's mental health history, the author's financial situation, and the way they handled the situation. The friend's reaction seems extreme, but the author's response might have been harsh, especially given the friend's mental state.\n\nDepression and suicidal thoughts are serious. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative or selfish in asking for expensive gifts when the author can't afford it, the mention of self-harm and suicide is a red flag. The author acknowledged that the friend was being passive-aggressive and manipulative but then called him out directly. However, in a situation where someone is in crisis, the immediate reaction should prioritize their well-being. Maybe the author should have been more understanding or sought to de-escalate the situation instead of labeling the friend as selfish. \n\nBut the author also mentions that the friend was being manipulative, which adds complexity. The friend's actions might be a cry for help rather than genuine manipulation. However, the author is in a difficult position financially and mentally exhausted from supporting the friend. \n\nI think the main issue here is whether calling the friend selfish was an appropriate response given his mental state. Even if the friend's actions were self-centered, the author might have handled it differently. Instead of labeling, maybe they should have expressed their inability to afford it more compassionately and offered support in another way. \n\nBut the friend's response of self-harm and suicide talk is a serious issue. The author's reaction might have been a result of stress and burnout from supporting the friend for a long time. Still, in such situations, the priority should be the friend's safety. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because they were trying to set boundaries, but their approach could have been better.\n\nWait, but did the author address the friend's suicidal comments? They just called him selfish. That's probably a problem. When someone is in crisis, even if they're acting out, the response should be to de-escalate and offer help, not criticize. The author's reaction might have pushed the friend away instead of helping. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy, despite the friend's manipulative behavior.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't respond appropriately to the friend's crisis, even if the friend was being difficult. Prioritizing mental health and responding with compassion is crucial in such cases.\n"
