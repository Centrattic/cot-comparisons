I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend got suicidal over asking for Airpods.\n\nFirst, the friend is dealing with depression and has been supported by the author. The friend asks for an expensive gift, Airpods, which the author can't afford. The author apologizes but refuses, and the friend reacts by becoming passive-aggressive, mentions self-harm, and makes suicidal comments. The author then calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nThe key points here are the mental health aspect and the way both parties handled the situation. The friend's history of depression is important. When someone is in a vulnerable state, their actions might be influenced by their mental health, not just being manipulative. The author might feel pressured because they've been supporting the friend, but the friend's reaction\u2014using self-harm and suicide threats\u2014as leverage is concerning. However, calling someone selfish in the context of their depression might not be the best approach. The author's frustration is understandable, but the friend's behavior is a red flag. The author might not be in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. The friend's use of suicidal threats to get what they want is manipulative regardless of their mental state. The author's response, while harsh, is a reaction to that manipulation. So, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong), but with a caveat that both need to consider better communication and the friend's mental health.\n"
