I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend selfish is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend with depression who reacted strongly to not getting Airpods for their birthday. The key points here are the friend's mental health history, the context of the request, and the response from the author.\n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting them. The friend asked for Airpods, which the author can't afford. The author apologized but the friend became angry and passive-aggressive. Then the friend sent pictures of self-harm and threatened suicide. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, considering mental health, especially depression, it's a serious condition. Self-harm and suicidal comments are red flags. The friend might be acting out of emotional pain rather than just being manipulative. The author is in a tough spot financially and tried to be honest, but the way they responded\u2014labeling the friend as selfish\u2014might come off as dismissive of the friend's emotional state.\n\nHowever, the friend's behavior does include elements of manipulation, like mentioning previous gifts (even if the cost was different) and using self-harm as a reaction. But when someone is in crisis, especially with a history of depression, the priority should be addressing the crisis, not the manipulation. The author's reaction might not be the best, but it's also possible they were stressed and overwhelmed.\n\nThe question is whether calling the friend selfish makes the author the asshole. On one hand, the friend's actions were hurtful and manipulative. On the other hand, the friend is struggling with mental health. The author might not be in the wrong because they were honest about their financial situation, but they could have handled the situation more compassionately, especially when the friend was in distress. Still, the friend's response (self-harm and threats) is extreme and problematic. \n\nThe line between being selfish and being in crisis is thin here. The author called out the friend's manipulative behavior, which is valid, but they might have not provided enough support in that moment. However, given the friend's mental health, the author's response might be seen as harsh. But since the friend was already in a bad place, the author's words could have been hurtful. \n\nI think the author is partially in the wrong because they dismissed the friend's emotional crisis with a label of selfishness instead of offering support. But the friend's behavior was definitely inappropriate. However, in the context of mental health, the author's response might not be the best, so they could be partly at fault. But considering the friend's history, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. It's a tough call. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the friend's actions were manipulative, but the way they responded might not be the best. However, the question is whether they are the asshole. Since the friend was in crisis, the author's response could be seen as harsh, but they weren't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, maybe they are in the wrong for not supporting their friend adequately in a crisis. Hmm.\n"
