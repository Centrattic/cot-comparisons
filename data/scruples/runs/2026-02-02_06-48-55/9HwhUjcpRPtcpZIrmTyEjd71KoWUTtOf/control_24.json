I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend had a suicidal episode. \n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been trying to support them. The friend asked for Airpods as a birthday present, but the author couldn't afford it. The friend got angry, passive-aggressive, and even sent pictures of self-harm. They also mentioned wanting to hang themselves. The author then called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nSo, the main points here are the friend's mental health, the author's financial situation, and the friend's reaction. The author is under stress from supporting a friend with depression, which is taking a toll. The friend's behavior escalated to self-harm and suicidal comments, which is a red flag. The author's response was to call them out as selfish, which might not be the best approach in a crisis.\n\nBut wait, is the author wrong? The friend's actions are alarming. In a real crisis, the priority should be addressing the immediate mental health issue, not focusing on the request for a gift. The author's frustration is understandable given their financial constraints and the stress of supporting someone, but reacting with an accusation of selfishness could be seen as dismissive of the friend's emotional state.\n\nHowever, the author did try to be apologetic when declining the gift, which shows they considered the friend's feelings. The friend's response was extreme and possibly manipulative, given the history of them getting more reasonable gifts. The author might feel taken advantage of, but in a situation involving self-harm and suicide threats, the appropriate response is to seek help rather than confront the friend. \n\nSo, while the author's financial situation is valid, the way they handled the friend's crisis could be problematic. They might not be in the wrong entirely, but they could have handled it better by not calling the friend selfish and instead focusing on the urgent mental health issue. The answer might lean towards the author not being the asshole, but there's room for improvement in their response.\n"
