I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is depressed and the author's response when the friend asked for Airpods for his birthday.\n\nFirst, the friend is dealing with depression and has a history of being supported by the author. The author is in a tight financial situation and can't afford expensive gifts. The friend wanted Airpods, which are expensive, and when the author said they couldn't afford it, the friend reacted angrily and even showed self-harm. The author then called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to a day-long silence.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's mental health, the author's financial constraints, and the friend's reaction. The author is under stress financially and is trying to be honest about what they can give. The friend, however, is using their mental health as leverage to pressure the author into buying something expensive. The author's response was to call them out on the guilt-tripping, which might have been harsh given the friend's emotional state.\n\nBut wait, is it wrong for the author to set boundaries? If the friend is using emotional manipulation, even if they are depressed, the author has the right to say no. However, the way the author expressed their refusal by saying \"selfish and manipulative\" might have been insensitive, especially when the friend is already in a vulnerable state. The author could have handled it more compassionately, perhaps by explaining the financial situation more carefully and offering an alternative gift.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior of threatening suicide and self-harm in a passive-aggressive way is concerning. But the friend's depression is a real issue. The author might feel drained from consistently supporting them, which is valid, but responding with such direct accusations could have been hurtful. The friend's reaction is also problematic, but the author's response might have been too harsh given the context.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the way they communicated it could be seen as lacking empathy. The friend's actions are manipulative, but the author's reaction might have exacerbated the situation. So, maybe the answer is A, but I'm a bit torn because setting boundaries is important too. However, the immediate judgment is that the author was wrong to call them selfish, especially in such a sensitive moment.\n"
