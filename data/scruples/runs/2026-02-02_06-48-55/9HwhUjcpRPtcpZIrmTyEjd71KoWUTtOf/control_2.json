I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend has been depressed, and the author has been supporting him. But when the friend asked for Airpods for his birthday, the author couldn't afford them and said no. The friend then got angry, sent pictures of self-harm, and made suicidal comments. The author called him selfish and manipulative, and the friend ignored them after.\n\nFirst, the author is in a tough spot because they're low on money. They probably didn't want to hurt their friend but had to be honest. But when the friend reacted with self-harm and suicide talk, the author's response was to call him selfish. That part is concerning. Even if the friend was being manipulative, responding with that kind of accusation during a crisis might have made things worse. The friend was already struggling with depression, and the author's words could have added to his feelings of worthlessness. \n\nAlso, when someone is threatening self-harm or suicide, the appropriate response is usually to take it seriously, offer support, maybe even contact someone to help. Telling someone they're selfish in that moment might be seen as invalidating their feelings. The author might have been stressed and frustrated, but in a crisis situation, that's not the time for blame. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was definitely manipulative. Using self-harm and suicidal threats to guilt someone into buying an expensive gift is not okay. But the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The author had a right to say they couldn't afford it, but the way they responded to the friend's crisis might have been harmful. \n\nSo, the author might not be the \"asshole\" in the sense that they're being honest about their financial situation, but their reaction to the friend's crisis could have been inappropriate. The friend's actions are definitely problematic, but the author's response might have been unhelpful at best and harmful at worst. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault for how they handled the emotional crisis instead of providing support. \n\nHmm, but maybe the author was just frustrated and snapped. It's tricky because both parties have issues here. The author's words were harsh, but the friend's behavior was manipulative. However, in such situations, the person in crisis usually needs empathy, not criticism. So the author's response was probably not the right approach, making them at least partly in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they responded with blame during a crisis, which is not helpful and could exacerbate the friend's issues.\n"
