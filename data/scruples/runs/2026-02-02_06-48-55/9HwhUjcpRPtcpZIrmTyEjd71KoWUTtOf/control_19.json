I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. So, the user is asking about their friend who has been depressed for a while. They've been supporting their friend a lot, which is taking a mental toll. When the friend asks for AirPods for their birthday, the user can't afford it and says no. The friend then gets angry, passive-aggressive, and even threatens suicide. The user calls them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the friend's depression. People with depression might act out in different ways, sometimes using suicidal threats as a cry for help or to manipulate. But that doesn't mean the user is wrong for setting a boundary. The user is clearly in a tough spot financially and tried to be apologetic. However, the friend's reaction seems extreme and possibly self-harm related. \n\nThe user's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative. While it's understandable to feel frustrated, calling someone manipulative when they're threatening suicide could come off as dismissive of their genuine emotional pain. Even if the friend's actions were manipulative, the user's friend might be in a vulnerable state, and the user's response might not have been the best way to handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, the user was honest about their financial situation and apologized. They tried to support their friend emotionally but had limits. The friend's behavior\u2014using self-harm and suicidal threats to pressure for a gift\u2014is concerning and not healthy. The user might not be wrong in setting a boundary, but their approach in calling the friend selfish could have been hurtful, especially when the friend is already struggling.\n\nI think the key points are: the user's friend has a history of depression, the user was honest but faced a manipulative response, and the user's reaction might have been a bit harsh given the friend's mental state. So, the user might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been more empathetic. However, the friend's use of suicidal threats is definitely problematic. The answer might lean towards the user not being the asshole, but maybe there's a nuance where both parties have some responsibility.\n"
