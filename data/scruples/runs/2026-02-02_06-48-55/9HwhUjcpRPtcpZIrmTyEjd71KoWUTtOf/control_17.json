I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong after calling their friend selfish when the friend got suicidal over airpods. \n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while and the writer has been trying to support them, which is mentally taxing. The friend asked for Airpods as a birthday gift, but the writer can't afford it. The friend becomes angry and passive-aggressive, mentions past gifts (which were cheaper), and then starts sending pictures of self-harm and mentions suicide. The writer responds by calling them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, considering the context: the friend's mental health is a significant factor. Depression can lead to impulsive or extreme reactions. The friend might be using emotional manipulation, but the writer is in a vulnerable position due to financial constraints. However, when someone is suicidal, the immediate priority is their safety. The writer's response of labeling the friend as selfish and manipulative might not be constructive, especially during a crisis. Even if the friend's actions were manipulative, the writer's reaction could exacerbate the situation. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the writer being honest about their financial situation. They tried to be apologetic, but the friend's reaction was extreme. The writer might feel overwhelmed and their response was a defense mechanism. However, calling someone selfish when they're in a mental health crisis might not be the best approach. It's possible the friend was testing boundaries or acting out due to their depression. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some role. The friend shouldn't use self-harm or suicide threats to manipulate, but the writer shouldn't dismiss their friend's mental health struggles by labeling them as selfish. The writer might need to find a balance between honesty and empathy. However, given the situation, the writer's reaction could be seen as harsh, especially in the context of the friend's mental state. \n\nBut wait, the writer did mention being extremely apologetic first. The friend's response was escalating, including self-harm and suicide mentions. The writer's response of calling them selfish might be a justified reaction to manipulation, but it's possible they should have handled it with more care. However, the friend's use of self-harm and suicide as leverage is definitely problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's response could be seen as harsh, the friend's behavior is also clearly manipulative and concerning. The writer isn't entirely in the wrong because they were honest about their limits, but they might need to approach the situation with more empathy. However, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. Considering the friend's mental state and the writer's reaction, it's a nuanced situation. But given that the friend's actions involved self-harm and suicide threats, the writer's response, while perhaps blunt, might be a result of being overwhelmed. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the friend's manipulation is a bigger issue, but the writer could have handled it better. But I'm leaning towards B because the friend's actions are more extreme and manipulative, and the writer was honest about their financial situation.\n"
