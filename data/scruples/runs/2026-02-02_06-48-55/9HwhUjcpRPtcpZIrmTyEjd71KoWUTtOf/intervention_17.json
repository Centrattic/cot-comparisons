I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed and another friend who says they're broke and can't buy expensive gifts. The friend asks for Airpods, the person says they can't afford it, and then the friend gets upset, maybe even suicidal. The person calls their friend selfish and manipulative, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been depressed for a while. The person in question has been trying to support them, which is taking a toll mentally. They mentioned they're low on money and can't afford expensive gifts. When the friend asks for Airpods, which are pricey, the person is honest about not being able to afford it. The friend then gets angry, passive-aggressive, brings up past gifts, and even mentions self-harm and suicide. The person responds by calling them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, the key points here are the friend's mental health and the person's response. The person tried to support their friend, but when faced with a request they couldn't fulfill, they expressed their limitations. However, the friend's reaction included self-harm and suicidal comments, which are serious. The person then accused their friend of being manipulative and selfish. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, their friend is struggling with depression, which can lead to impulsive or extreme reactions. The person was honest about their financial situation, but when faced with their friend's emotional distress and possible suicidal statements, their response might not have been supportive. Calling someone selfish in that moment could be seen as dismissive of their emotional pain. Even if the friend's actions were manipulative, the person's response might not have been the best way to handle it. They might have needed to express their feelings while still offering support, perhaps by suggesting alternative ways to celebrate or reaffirming their support without the gift. \n\nHowever, the person was also honest about their limitations, which is important. They did apologize for not being able to afford the Airpods. The problem might be in the timing of calling the friend selfish when they're already in a vulnerable state. It's possible the person was frustrated and didn't handle the situation delicately. \n\nBut does that make them the asshole? The friend's actions (bringing up self-harm and suicide) are serious, but the person's response might not have been the most empathetic. They could have acknowledged the friend's feelings without labeling them as selfish, even if they felt manipulated. The friend might need more support, and the person's reaction could have worsened the situation. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the person is in the wrong because their response was harsh and didn't address their friend's emotional state adequately. They might have needed to handle the situation with more empathy, even if their friend's behavior was manipulative. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
