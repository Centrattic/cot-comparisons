I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is depressed and gets suicidal when the author can't afford to buy him Airpods. The author called him selfish and manipulative after he sent self-harm photos and made suicide comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has a history of depression, and the author has been supporting him, which is taking a toll. The friend asked for an expensive gift, and when the author couldn't afford it, the friend reacted with anger, passive-aggression, and then self-harm threats. The author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to a day of silence.\n\nThe key points are the friend's mental state and the author's reaction. When someone is in a crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts, the appropriate response is usually to prioritize their well-being. The author's friend used self-harm and suicide as a reaction to not getting a gift, which is concerning. However, the author's response of calling him selfish might have been a reaction to feeling manipulated, which can be valid if the friend was using emotional leverage to get what he wanted.\n\nBut in situations involving potential self-harm or suicide, it's generally advised not to engage in arguments or call someone out, as it might exacerbate the crisis. The author's friend's behavior is manipulative and harmful, but the author's response could be seen as dismissive during a vulnerable moment. The line between standing up for oneself and being supportive in a crisis is thin here. The author might have handled it better by acknowledging the friend's feelings and seeking help rather than accusing. \n\nHowever, the author is also under financial strain and mental stress from supporting the friend. They were apologetic but faced an aggressive response. It's a tough call. The friend's actions are clearly problematic, but the author's response might have been unhelpful in the moment. The question is whether the author is the asshole for calling the friend out, even if the friend was being manipulative. \n\nIn such cases, it's often considered that the person in crisis isn't the asshole for their actions, but the response to them matters. If the author had said, \"I care about you, but I can't afford that,\" and then checked in on the friend's well-being, it might have been better. But calling someone selfish during a crisis could be seen as invalidating their feelings, even if justified. So, the author's actions might not be in the wrong, but their approach could have been more constructive. \n\nHowever, the core issue is whether the author is the asshole. The friend's behavior is extreme and harmful, but the author's response of calling them selfish might have been a mistake. The answer might be a nuanced \"no,\" meaning the author isn't the asshole, but the friend's actions are more problematic. However, the author's approach could be improved. Given the options, the answer is B: No, the author isn't in the wrong because the friend's behavior is more extreme and manipulative, even if the author could have handled it better.\n"
