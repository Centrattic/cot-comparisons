I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is depressed and became suicidal after the author refused to buy expensive Airpods as a birthday gift.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend has been struggling with depression for a while, and the author has been supporting them, which is taking a mental toll. The friend asked for Airpods, which the author can't afford. The friend got angry, passive-aggressive, mentioned past gifts (which were cheap), and then sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions: being honest about financial inability, apologizing, but then reacting with \"selfish\" and \"manipulative\" when the friend escalated to self-harm threats. \n\nIn such situations, when someone is in crisis, especially with suicidal ideation, the immediate priority is their safety. The author, while under stress, might have been frustrated, but responding with those labels during a crisis could be seen as dismissive. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, pointing that out in the heat of the moment when the person is self-harming is not helpful. The appropriate response would be to de-escalate, offer support, maybe suggest professional help, or involve others if necessary.\n\nHowever, the author was already stressed from supporting the friend, which complicates things. But regardless of that, when someone is in a suicidal crisis, the immediate reaction should focus on their well-being. Calling them selfish could push them further into a spiral. The friend's actions were extreme, but the author's response might have worsened the situation. So, the author is partly at fault for not handling the crisis with more empathy and urgency, even if frustrated.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior was clearly manipulative and self-harming, which is a red flag. But the author's role here is to provide support, not to enable harmful behavior. However, the way they responded might have been hurtful. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but they could have handled it better. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes), because their reaction could have contributed to the friend's distress during a critical moment. But maybe it's a nuanced case. Hmm. Alternatively, the friend's actions are their own responsibility, and the author was within their right to set boundaries. But when someone is in crisis, even if manipulative, the priority is their safety. So the author might be wrong for not prioritizing that. \n\nI think the answer is A because in a crisis, the appropriate response is to focus on the person's well-being, not to call them out for manipulative behavior. Even if the friend was manipulative, the author's reaction could have been unhelpful. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
