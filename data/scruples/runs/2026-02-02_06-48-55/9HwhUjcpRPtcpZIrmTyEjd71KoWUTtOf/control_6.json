I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The key points here are about a friend who's been depressed, the author trying to support them, and the friend getting upset over not getting Airpods for their birthday.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression, which is a serious mental health issue. The author mentions they've been supporting their friend a lot, which is commendable but also taxing. When the friend asked for Airpods, the author couldn't afford it and said no. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, and made self-harm comments. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, the author is in a tough spot financially and had to say no. They were polite and apologetic. The friend's reaction, including self-harm threats and passive-aggression, is concerning. The author's response was to call them out on being selfish, which might be harsh given the friend's mental state. However, the author was defending their own limits and not giving in to guilt-tripping.\n\nBut here's the catch: when someone is dealing with depression or suicidal thoughts, their capacity to handle stress or rejection might be lower. The friend's reaction of threatening self-harm in response to not getting a gift is alarming. However, the author's response was to label them as selfish and manipulative, which could be dismissive of their genuine emotional pain. Even if the friend was trying to manipulate, the author could have addressed it without using such terms, maybe by expressing their own feelings and setting boundaries more compassionately.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. They can't be expected to give a gift they can't afford, especially if they've been in a supportive role for a long time. However, the way they responded might have been hurtful. Calling someone selfish in such a sensitive context could make the friend feel even more isolated, which isn't helpful. The author might have needed to acknowledge the friend's distress while standing their ground, perhaps suggesting a less expensive alternative or offering support in another way.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They were in a difficult situation, trying to manage their own finances while supporting a friend with mental health issues. Their response was direct but maybe not the most empathetic approach. While they have a right to not give gifts they can't afford, the way they communicated their decision could be seen as lacking sensitivity. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the harsh words used, even if their intention was to set a boundary. However, some might argue that the friend's manipulative behavior justifies the author's reaction. But given the context of the friend's depression and self-harm, the author's approach could have been more compassionate, making them partially at fault.\n"
