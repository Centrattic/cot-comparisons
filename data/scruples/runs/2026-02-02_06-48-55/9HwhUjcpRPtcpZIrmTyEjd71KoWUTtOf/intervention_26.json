I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's depressed and asked for expensive AirPods as a birthday gift. The author couldn't afford it and told him so, but the friend reacted angrily, mentioned previous gifts (which were cheaper), and then threatened self-harm. The author called him selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's mental health. The friend has been depressed for a while and is clearly struggling. When he was told he couldn't get the expensive gift, he reacted with passive-aggressiveness and then mentioned self-harm. That's a red flag, indicating he might be in crisis. The author's response was to call him selfish and manipulative, which might have been a knee-jerk reaction to the friend's threatening behavior. \n\nBut wait, when someone is threatening self-harm, the appropriate response is usually to take it seriously and offer support. Calling them selfish could be seen as dismissive of their genuine emotional pain. Even if the friend was being manipulative, the immediate priority should be ensuring his safety. The author might have been under stress from trying to support the friend, but their response could have worsened the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was honest about their financial limitations and apologized. They might have felt manipulated by the friend's tactics, especially after the friend brought up past gifts. However, the line between being honest and being dismissive can be thin here. The key point is that when someone is in crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts, the response should prioritize their well-being over arguments about gifts. The author's choice of words (\"selfish\" and \"manipulative\") might have been unhelpful and could have hurt the friend further.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction escalated after the author's comment. Even if it's possible the friend was trying to guilt-trip the author, the appropriate action would be to de-escalate the situation and perhaps seek help or talk to someone else if they feel overwhelmed. The author's response might have been a valid expression of frustration, but in a crisis situation, that could be counterproductive.\n\nSo, considering the mental health aspect and the immediate need for support, the author's response might be seen as inconsiderate or unhelpful. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
