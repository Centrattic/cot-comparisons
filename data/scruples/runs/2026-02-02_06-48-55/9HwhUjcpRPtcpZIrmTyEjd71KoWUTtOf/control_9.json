I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and the author is struggling financially. The friend wanted Airpods for a birthday, which the author couldn't afford. The friend got upset, mentioned self-harm, and made passive-aggressive comments. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a tough financial spot and has been supporting their friend emotionally, which is taking a toll. They were honest about not being able to afford the Airpods. The friend has depression and a history of self-harm, which is a serious mental health issue. When the friend started mentioning suicide, the author responded with accusation instead of empathy, which could have made the situation worse. \n\nBut wait, the author was clearly stressed and trying to set boundaries. The friend's demands might have crossed a line, especially with the passive-aggressive remarks about past gifts. The author's frustration is understandable, but reacting with \"selfish and manipulative\" when the friend is in crisis might be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn situations involving mental health crises, the priority is usually the well-being of the person at risk. The friend's behavior, while possibly manipulative, is rooted in their depression. The author's response might have been a knee-jerk reaction to stress and exhaustion. However, calling someone selfish in such a context could be seen as not taking their mental health seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did apologize for not being able to afford the gift and was upfront. The friend escalated the situation by bringing up self-harm and suicide, which the author might not have handled well. But the author's responsibility here is to support their friend, even if they feel manipulated. \n\nSo, the key points are: the friend's mental health is a critical factor. The author's reaction could be seen as lacking compassion in a crisis. While the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author's response might have been inconsiderate of their mental state. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not responding with more empathy during the friend's crisis, even if the friend was being difficult. The right approach would be to address the emotional distress first, then discuss the gift. But since the author didn't do that, they might be the asshole here.\n"
