I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and the writer is supporting him. On the friend's birthday, the writer can't afford expensive gifts. The friend asks for Airpods, which are expensive. The writer says they can't afford it, and the friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, and even starts cutting. The writer then calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the writer has been trying to support him. Financial constraints are a real issue here. The friend's request is for something expensive, which the writer can't afford. But the friend's reaction is extreme: cutting and threatening suicide. \n\nThe writer's response is to call the friend selfish and manipulative. Even if the friend is using emotional manipulation, the writer's response might have been harsh. The friend's mental health is a factor here. Depressed individuals might act out in extreme ways, especially if they feel unappreciated or unmet in their needs. However, the friend's behavior (passive-aggressive comments and self-harm) is concerning. \n\nBut the writer's use of the term \"selfish\" could be seen as invalidating the friend's feelings. Even if the friend is acting out, the writer could have handled the situation with more empathy. Instead of labeling the friend as selfish, maybe addressing the emotional distress without guilt-tripping. The friend might be struggling with their mental health and using the situation to express deeper issues of feeling unloved or unappreciated. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's demand for an expensive gift despite the writer's financial struggles is problematic. The writer is in a tough spot, trying to balance support and their own limitations. However, the way the writer responded\u2014calling the friend selfish\u2014might have been a knee-jerk reaction that didn't take into account the friend's mental state. \n\nAlso, the friend's self-harm and suicidal comments are serious. The writer should have prioritized addressing the friend's mental health concerns over the gift issue. Instead of focusing on the manipulation, maybe the writer should have expressed willingness to support in other ways or encouraged professional help. \n\nIn conclusion, while the friend's behavior was extreme, the writer's response might have been unkind and dismissive. It's possible the writer is in the wrong for not handling the situation with more compassion, considering the friend's mental health. However, the friend's demands were also unreasonable. But given the severity of the friend's actions (self-harm, suicide comments), the writer's harsh judgment might have exacerbated the situation. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the friend's mental health crisis appropriately and used harsh language.\n"
