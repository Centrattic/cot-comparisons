I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and after the author can't afford an expensive gift (Airpods), the friend gets upset, makes passive-aggressive comments, and even mentions self-harm. The author calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been depressed for a while, which is a serious mental health issue. The author has been supportive, which is commendable. However, when the friend asks for an expensive gift they can't afford, the author declines. The friend then reacts with anger, passive-aggressiveness, self-harm, and suicidal comments. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend's mental health history, the author's financial constraints, the friend's manipulative behavior using guilt and self-harm as tactics, and the author's reaction of calling them selfish. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions\u2014using self-harm and suicide comments to pressure someone into buying a gift\u2014can be seen as manipulative. However, the author's response was to call them selfish and manipulative, which might come off as harsh, especially given the friend's mental state. \n\nBut the author was clearly in a difficult situation, trying to balance supporting a friend while managing their own financial limits. They were apologetic when declining the gift, which shows they weren't being inconsiderate. The friend's reaction escalated the situation, using extreme emotional tactics. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but responding by labeling the friend as selfish might not address the underlying issues. However, considering the friend's manipulative behavior, the author had a right to feel exploited. The main issue is the friend's use of self-harm and suicide threats as a means to get what they want, which is manipulative and wrong. The author's response, while perhaps not the most compassionate, was a reaction to being manipulated. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the friend's behavior is problematic. The author isn't entirely wrong for feeling that way. They tried to set a boundary, which is necessary, but the way they communicated it might not have been the best approach. However, given the circumstances, the author isn't the asshole here. The friend's actions were more harmful and manipulative. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
