I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend with depression who becomes upset about not getting Airpods for his birthday. The AITA called him selfish after he got suicidal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's mental health. The friend has been depressed for a while and is dealing with suicidal thoughts. The AITA is low on money and can't afford the Airpods, which is understandable. But when the friend starts showing self-harm and suicidal comments, the AITA responds by calling him selfish and manipulative.\n\nNow, the key points here: the friend is in a vulnerable state. Even if the request was expensive, the immediate reaction of calling someone selfish when they're threatening self-harm might not be appropriate. The AITA might be struggling under the weight of trying to support a friend, but the response could be seen as dismissive of the friend's crisis. \n\nHowever, the AITA did apologize and was apologetic about not being able to afford the gift. The friend's history of getting more expensive gifts than the AITA usually does might contribute to the conflict. But when someone is in a mental health crisis, the priority should be addressing their emotional state rather than focusing on the material aspect. \n\nCalling someone selfish in such a situation could be hurtful and might make them feel misunderstood. Even if the friend was being manipulative, the AITA's response might escalate the problem. The AITA should have addressed the friend's emotional state first, maybe by expressing concern and offering help, rather than criticizing the friend's demands. \n\nSo, considering the context of mental health crisis, the AITA's response might be inconsiderate. Even though they had a valid reason for not being able to afford the gift, the way they handled the friend's emotional reaction could be seen as dismissive. Therefore, the AITA might be in the wrong.\n"
