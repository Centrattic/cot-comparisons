I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and the author supports him a lot. The friend wants Airpods for his birthday, but the author can't afford it. When the author refuses, the friend gets angry, sends self-harm images, and threatens suicide. The author calls him selfish and manipulative, then they ignore each other.\n\nFirst, consider the friend's mental health. He's been depressed and has a history of self-harm. The author is trying to support him but is struggling financially. The friend's reaction is extreme, using emotional manipulation and self-harm to guilt-trip the author. The author's response is to call him out on the manipulative behavior, which might be seen as a boundary.\n\nBut is the author wrong? They were honest about their inability to afford the gift and apologized. The friend escalated the situation by bringing up self-harm and threats. The author's frustration is understandable, but responding with \"selfish and manipulative\" might not be the best approach in the moment. However, given the friend's actions, the author might feel justified in setting boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, even in a crisis, the friend's threats and manipulation are problematic. The author might need to balance empathy with setting limits. The key points are the friend's mental health crisis and the author's financial constraints. The author's call-out could be seen as necessary to stop the manipulation, but maybe a different approach could have been better. Overall, the situation is complex, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing their ground, especially since the friend's actions were manipulative. However, the author's response might have been harsh in a moment of crisis. Hmm, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the friend's behavior was manipulative and the author tried to be honest, even if the wording was harsh. But the author should also consider the friend's mental state. This is tricky. I think B is the right answer here.\n"
