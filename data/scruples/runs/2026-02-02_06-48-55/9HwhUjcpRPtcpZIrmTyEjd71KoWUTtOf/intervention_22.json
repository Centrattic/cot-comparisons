I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's friend is depressed and has been getting support from the author. The author is currently broke and asked the friend what they wanted for their birthday. The friend asked for Airpods, which the author can't afford. The author apologized but said they can't buy them. The friend got angry, made passive-aggressive comments about past gifts (which were cheaper), and started sending pictures of self-harm, saying they want to hang themselves. The author then called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to a day of no contact.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the friend's depression and history of self-harm, the author's financial situation, and the friend's reaction. The author is being asked if they're the asshole for calling the friend out on what they perceived as manipulation and guilt-tripping.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression and suicidal thoughts, which is a serious mental health issue. The author has been trying to support them, which is commendable. But when the friend asks for an expensive gift they can't afford, the author is in a tight spot. They have to balance their own financial limitations with their friend's emotional state.\n\nThe friend's reaction seems extreme. They got angry and passive-aggressive, bringing up past gifts that were much cheaper. Then they sent self-harm photos and suicidal comments. This is a red flag. The author tried to set a boundary by saying they can't afford it, but the friend's response was manipulative and potentially dangerous.\n\nNow, when the author called the friend selfish and manipulative, was that wrong? Well, in the moment, the friend was using their depression and self-harm as a way to guilt-trip the author into buying something they can't afford. The author is in a vulnerable position, trying to support a friend but also needing to manage their own resources. \n\nBut the friend's actions\u2014threatening suicide and showing self-harm\u2014deserve immediate concern. The author's response might have been harsh in that context. Even if the friend was manipulative, the author should prioritize their friend's safety. However, the friend's mental health is a long-standing issue, and the author might be feeling overwhelmed.\n\nI think the author is in the right for setting a boundary and being honest about their financial limitations. However, calling the friend selfish might not have been the best approach, especially when the friend was already in a vulnerable state. The author might have handled it differently, like expressing empathy for the friend's feelings while still being clear about their own constraints. But considering the friend's manipulative behavior and the author's own stress, maybe it's not entirely their fault. \n\nWait, but the friend's actions are part of a pattern. If the friend consistently uses self-harm and suicidal comments to manipulate others, that's a serious issue. The author isn't responsible for solving the friend's mental health problems, but they also need to protect their own boundaries. However, the way the author responded might not have been the most constructive. Instead of calling the friend selfish, maybe the author should have suggested seeking professional help or expressed concern for their well-being while maintaining their own limits.\n\nIn summary, while the author has a right to be honest about their financial situation, the way they communicated their boundary could have been more compassionate. But given the friend's manipulative tactics, the author might be justified in calling them out. However, the situation's complexity means the answer isn't straightforward. The author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for a more supportive approach.\n"
