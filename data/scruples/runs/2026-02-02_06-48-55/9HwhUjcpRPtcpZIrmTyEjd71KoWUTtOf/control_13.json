I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend became suicidal over wanting Airpods.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression. The author has been supporting them, which is commendable. The friend asked for Airpods, but the author can't afford them. The friend then reacts angrily, mentions cutting and suicidal thoughts, and the author calls them selfish.\n\nNow, the key points here are the friend's mental health history and the author's response. The friend's actions\u2014bringing up self-harm and suicide\u2014are serious and alarming. The author's response was to label the friend as selfish and manipulative. While the author might be under stress from trying to support a friend, responding with such strong language in a crisis might not be helpful. However, the friend's manipulation through self-harm threats complicates things.\n\nBut wait, calling someone selfish when they're struggling with depression and mental health issues could be seen as dismissive. The author might be frustrated, but using that term could worsen the friend's feelings. The friend's actions are manipulative, but the author's response might not have been appropriate given the context. The author could have handled it differently, maybe by expressing their financial constraints more empathetically and offering alternative support. However, the friend's manipulation through self-harm is a red flag. The author's frustration is understandable, but the response might not have been the best approach. So, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for their reaction, even if the friend's behavior was manipulative. The answer is A.\n"
