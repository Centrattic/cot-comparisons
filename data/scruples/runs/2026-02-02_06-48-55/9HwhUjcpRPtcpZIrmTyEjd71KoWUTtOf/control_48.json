I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend asking for expensive Airpods as a birthday gift when the author can't afford it, leading to the friend threatening suicide and the author calling them selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend is already depressed, and the author has been supporting them, which is taking a toll. The friend asked for Airpods, the author couldn't afford it and said so. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, brought up past gifts (which were cheaper), showed self-harm and suicidal thoughts, and the author responded by calling them selfish. Now they're ignoring each other.\n\nSo the main issues here are: the friend's mental health, the author's financial situation, and the author's response to the friend's threats.\n\nThe author was honest about not being able to afford the gift. That's understandable. But the friend reacted with passive-aggression and escalated to self-harm and suicidal comments. The author then called them selfish and manipulative. The question is whether that response was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is in a tough spot. They can't afford the gift, and they're already stressed from supporting their friend. On the other hand, when a friend is in crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts, it's important to approach with empathy and not dismiss their feelings, even if they're using manipulation tactics.\n\nCalling someone selfish when they're in a vulnerable state might not be the best approach. Even if the friend was trying to guilt-trip, the author's response could have been more supportive. Instead of labeling the friend as selfish, they might have needed to acknowledge the friend's feelings while still explaining their own limits.\n\nAlso, the friend's action of showing self-harm and talking about suicide is a serious red flag. The author should prioritize addressing that, perhaps by encouraging the friend to seek help or offering to support them in another way. Reacting with blame could push the friend further away, especially when they're struggling.\n\nBut the author is also under stress and might be overwhelmed. It's possible they snapped because they were already stretched thin. However, the friend's behavior, while manipulative, is a result of their mental health issues. The author's response might have come from a place of frustration, but it's important to handle such situations with care.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were honest about their financial limits. However, their reaction could have been more empathetic, especially given the friend's mental state. The friend's actions were extreme, but the author's response of calling them selfish might have been inappropriate given the context. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not handling it with more compassion. But it's a complex situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were honest and the friend's actions were extreme, but some might argue the author's response was harsh. However, given the friend's self-harm and suicide threats, the author's comment could be seen as insensitive. So maybe A (in the wrong). Hmm.\n"
