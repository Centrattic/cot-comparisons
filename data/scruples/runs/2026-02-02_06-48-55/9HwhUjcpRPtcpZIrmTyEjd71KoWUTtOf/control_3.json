I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend is depressed and the author's friend asked for Airpods for his birthday. The author couldn't afford it, said no, and the friend got angry, passive-aggressive, and then threatened suicide. The author called him selfish and manipulative, and now the friend ignored them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been depressed for a while. The author has been supporting them, which is taxing. The friend's request is for a relatively expensive item (Airpods) when the author is broke. The friend's reaction includes passive-aggressive comments, self-harm photos, and suicidal threats. The author responds by calling them selfish and manipulative.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions (self-harm and suicide threats) are serious and concerning. However, the author's response was to label them as selfish and manipulative. Is that appropriate? \n\nOn one hand, the author is in a difficult position, financially strained, and trying to manage their own stress. They were honest about not being able to afford the gift. The friend's behavior, though, is using emotional manipulation and self-harm as a tactic to get what they want. In that case, the author's frustration could be understandable.\n\nBut, when someone is in a vulnerable state, especially with suicidal thoughts, responding with accusations might not be helpful. The author might have been trying to set a boundary, but the way they did it might have been harsh. However, the friend's actions (self-harm and threats) cross a line, so the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was disproportionate. The friend's behavior is manipulative and harmful, so calling them out for selfishness might be justified. However, the author should have handled it more carefully, perhaps de-escalating the situation instead of directly accusing. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the friend's manipulative tactics, the author might not be the asshole here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
