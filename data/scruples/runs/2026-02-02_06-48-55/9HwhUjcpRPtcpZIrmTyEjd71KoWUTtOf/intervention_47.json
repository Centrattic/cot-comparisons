I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. So the situation is: the author's friend, who has been depressed for a while, asked for Airpods as a birthday gift. The author, who's low on money, refused to buy them. The friend got angry, passive-aggressive, mentioned their past purchases (which were cheaper), and then started sending pictures of self-harm, even talking about suicide. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative, and the friend ignored them after.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author is in a tough spot financially and has been trying to support a friend who's been depressed. They said they were apologetic but the friend reacted poorly. The friend's reaction includes self-harm and suicide comments, which are serious. The author called them out for being manipulative and selfish, which might have been a knee-jerk reaction.\n\nOn one hand, the author is honest about their financial situation and tried to be apologetic. But when someone is already in a vulnerable mental state, even if they're manipulating, the author's response of calling them selfish might not be the best approach. Also, when someone mentions suicide, especially with self-harm, the priority should be their safety. The author might have been frustrated and stressed, but dismissing the friend's emotional state with labels like \"selfish\" could exacerbate the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior\u2014using emotional manipulation, guilt-tripping, and threatening self-harm\u2014is definitely problematic. However, the author's friend has a history of depression, which complicates things. The author might not have handled it well, but their financial constraints are a real issue too.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's important to consider the mental health aspect. Even if the friend is manipulating, the author's response might have ignored the underlying depression and instead of providing support, they criticized the friend. But the friend's actions (self-harm, suicidal comments) are serious and require immediate attention, not just a rebuke.\n\nSo, maybe the author is partly at fault for not addressing the friend's mental health crisis properly. However, the friend is also in the wrong for manipulating and threatening self-harm. But in AITA scenarios, the focus is usually on the person asking. Since the author called the friend selfish and that led to ignoring each other, and given the friend's mental state, the author's reaction might not have been the best. However, the friend's behavior is also inexcusable. \n\nBut in terms of the question, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. The answer choices are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering the friend's history and the author's stress, maybe the author's reaction is understandable but still inappropriate. However, the friend's actions are more severe. But in AITA, the key is whether the person is an asshole. If the author called the friend selfish when they were in a vulnerable state, even if the friend was manipulative, the author's words might have been harsh and not supportive. So the author might be partially at fault. But since the friend's behavior is also bad, it's a tough call. However, the AITA format often looks for who is more in the wrong. The author might not be the asshole, but their actions contributed to the problem. However, given the friend's self-harm and suicide mention, maybe the author is not the main problem. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong. Let me check again. The author is in a financial bind, tried to be apologetic, but when the friend escalated, the author called them selfish. Even if the friend is manipulating, the author's response might not be helpful. So maybe the author is not wrong because they were honest about their situation and the friend overreacted. But the friend's self-harm is a red flag, and the author might have failed to address that. The author's words could have hurt more. So maybe the answer is A. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the friend's actions are really concerning, but the author's response was unhelpful. However, the author was under stress and had a valid reason for not buying the gift. In AITA, sometimes the person who is honest about their limits isn't the asshole. But when they dismiss someone's mental health issues, that's a problem. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't respond appropriately to the friend's crisis. Therefore, answer A.\n"
