I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who is depressed and becomes upset when the author can't afford to buy Airpods for his birthday. The friend then mentions cutting and suicidal thoughts, leading the author to call him selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the story. The friend has a history of depression. The author is struggling financially and can't afford expensive gifts. The friend asked for Airpods, which the author couldn't provide. The friend reacted angrily, made passive-aggressive comments about past gifts (which the author points out were much cheaper), sent pictures of self-harm, and mentioned wanting to die. The author responded by calling the friend selfish and manipulative, after which the friend ignored them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is in a difficult financial situation and is already stressed from supporting the friend. When the friend couldn't get the gift, he escalated the situation by threatening self-harm. The author's response was to call him out on being manipulative. \n\nBut wait, when someone is in a crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts or self-harm, the appropriate response is usually to prioritize their safety. The author's reaction here was to label the friend as selfish, which might not be the best approach in the moment. Even if the friend is manipulating, the immediate priority is ensuring they don't harm themselves. \n\nHowever, the friend's behavior is clearly manipulative and potentially dangerous. The author is under financial stress and might feel taken advantage of. But responding with an accusation of selfishness when someone is in a suicide crisis could be seen as not taking the situation seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did try to set a boundary, which is understandable. But the way they handled it might have been inappropriate given the friend's mental state. The author should have perhaps expressed their financial limits more clearly and offered alternative ways to support the friend instead of calling them out in that moment. \n\nAlso, the friend's actions of bringing up self-harm as a reaction to not getting a gift is a red flag. The author might be right in feeling that the friend is using their depression as a tool to get what they want. However, in such situations, the focus should be on de-escalation and ensuring safety, not confrontation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they had responded with concern and sought to de-escalate, that's better. But calling someone selfish during a mental health crisis might come off as dismissive. The author's responsibility is to support the friend, even if the friend is being manipulative. The immediate reaction might not have been the best, but the underlying issue is the friend's manipulative behavior. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is that the friend's actions are a serious mental health issue. The author's response, while possibly justified in frustration, might not have been appropriate given the context. However, the author is also in a tough spot financially and is trying to set boundaries. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether calling the friend selfish was the right move. In a crisis, even if someone is being manipulative, the immediate priority is their safety. The author might have been right to set boundaries, but the method could have been better. However, since the friend was threatening self-harm, the author's response might be seen as not taking the situation seriously. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for reacting that way instead of addressing the friend's safety first.\n"
