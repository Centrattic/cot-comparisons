I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend got suicidal over not getting Airpods. The friend has been depressed and the author has been supporting him. The friend asked for an expensive gift, the author couldn't afford it, got defensive, passive-aggressive, sent self-harm images, and made suicidal comments. The author then called him selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the friend's mental health. Depression can lead to impulsive or self-harming behaviors. The friend might be in a vulnerable state, and using guilt or threats to get what they want could be part of their illness. The author is in a tough spot financially and has been supportive, which shows they care. However, when the friend escalated with self-harm and suicide talk, the author's reaction was to call them selfish. \n\nCalling someone selfish in a moment of crisis might not be the most constructive response. Even if the friend's actions were manipulative, the immediate priority should be addressing the potential suicide risk. The author might have been stressed and overwhelmed, but the friend's life could be at risk. \n\nHowever, the friend's behavior was manipulative and harmful. Using self-harm as leverage is a serious issue. The author might have felt justified in setting a boundary, but the way they did it could have been unhelpful. The key is whether calling the friend selfish was an appropriate response given the circumstances. \n\nConsidering the mental health aspect, the author might not be in the wrong because they were being honest about their feelings. But the friend's life is more important than the argument about gifts. The author should have prioritized addressing the suicide comments over being confrontational. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not handling it more carefully.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions were clearly problematic. The author was in a difficult situation, trying to balance their own financial limits with supporting a friend in crisis. The author's frustration is understandable, but the timing and method of expressing that might be the issue. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they were honest about their feelings and had a right to set boundaries. But it's a nuanced situation where both sides have issues. However, the friend's manipulative behavior and self-harm are more concerning. The author's reaction was a moment of frustration, but they shouldn't be blamed for standing their ground. So I lean towards B.\n"
