I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who's been depressed and the author's response when the friend gets upset over not receiving Airpods for his birthday. \n\nFirst, the friend is already dealing with depression, which is a serious mental health issue. The author has been supporting him, which is understandable, but now the friend is asking for an expensive gift. The author is in a financial situation where they can't afford it, so they politely decline. But then the friend reacts strongly, gets passive-aggressive, and even threatens suicide. The author then calls the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nSo, the key points here: The friend's mental health is a big factor. Even though the author is stressed about supporting their friend, the friend's reaction includes self-harm and suicidal comments. When someone is depressed, their actions and reactions can be influenced by their mental state. The author's friend might have felt rejected or unimportant when the gift was denied, which could exacerbate their depression. \n\nThe author called the friend selfish and manipulative. While the author might feel pressured and frustrated, responding with such strong language when the friend is in crisis could be hurtful. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author's response might not be the healthiest way to handle it. The friend's threats of self-harm are serious and require immediate concern, not a confrontation about being selfish.\n\nHowever, the author is also under stress and might be feeling exploited. But in a situation where someone's mental health is at risk, the approach should be more about addressing the underlying issues rather than labeling the person. The author could have tried to explain their financial situation again, offered to help in another way, or suggested seeking professional help. \n\nThe main issue is whether calling the friend selfish was the right move. While the author has a right to set boundaries, the timing and method in response to suicidal threats might be inappropriate. The friend's actions are a cry for help, and the author's reaction might not be constructive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for how they responded, especially given the friend's mental state. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The friend's manipulation is there, but the author's response could have been handled better. The priority should be the friend's safety, so maybe the author should have de-escalated instead of confronting with such strong words. Yeah, I think the answer is A.\n"
