I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's depressed and suicidal, and the author called him selfish after he reacted strongly to not getting Airpods for his birthday.\n\nFirst, the author mentions their friend has been depressed for a while. They've been supporting him, which is taking a toll. When the friend asks for Airpods, the author can't afford it. The friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, brings up past gifts, and then sends self-harm photos and suicidal comments. The author responds by calling him selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nI need to consider the context. The friend's mental health is a critical factor here. Even if the friend acted out of line, the fact that he's suicidal complicates things. The author's response might be seen as dismissive during a crisis. Guilt-tripping or using self-harm as leverage is definitely wrong, but the author's reaction of labeling the friend as selfish and manipulative could have escalated the situation. \n\nHowever, the author was in a tough spot financially and was already stressed from supporting the friend. They expressed their inability to afford the gift and were apologetic. But when the friend used self-harm and suicide threats, the author's response was to call them out, which might be necessary to set boundaries but could also seem harsh given the context.\n\nThe key points are the friend's mental health crisis and the author's response. While the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author's callout might not have been the best approach. A more supportive yet firm boundary might have been better. But the author did acknowledge the situation and tried to be apologetic initially. Still, reacting with \"selfish\" and \"manipulative\" when the friend was in a crisis could be seen as not taking the situation seriously enough. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often looks at whether someone's actions were harmful despite the circumstances. The author's words might have hurt the friend further, especially during a vulnerable moment. Even if the friend was at fault for manipulative behavior, the author's response could be seen as not supportive, given the friend's mental state. So, the author might be in the wrong here for not responding with more empathy during a crisis, even if the friend's actions were problematic.\n"
