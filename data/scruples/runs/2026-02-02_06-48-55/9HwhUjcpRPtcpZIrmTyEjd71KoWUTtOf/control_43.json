I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed and getting suicidal over not receiving Airpods for a birthday. The author told their friend they couldn't afford it, but the friend got angry, passive-aggressive, and even mentioned self-harm. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to a day of ignoring each other.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend has a history of depression, which is a significant factor. The author has been supporting them, which is commendable, but it's also taking a mental toll. The friend's reaction seems extreme, but depression can make someone act out in unhealthy ways. The author's response was to label the friend as selfish, which might not be the best approach, especially given the friend's mental state.\n\nThe friend bringing up self-harm is a red flag. The author's immediate reaction was to accuse them of being manipulative, which could invalidate the friend's real emotional pain. Even if the friend's demands were unreasonable, the mention of self-harm requires a more empathetic response. The author's stress and financial situation are valid, but their friend's mental health is critical here.\n\nIn such situations, the priority should be addressing the friend's well-being. Arguing or labeling them as selfish might push them further into a crisis. The author might have been trying to set boundaries, but the way they communicated it was harmful. They could have expressed their financial constraints while still showing concern for their friend's mental state, perhaps suggesting alternative ways to celebrate the birthday without the Airpods.\n\nThe friend's behavior, while problematic, might stem from their depression rather than intentional manipulation. It's possible they didn't realize how their actions were affecting others or were using the birthday to seek attention due to feeling neglected. However, the author's response could have been more supportive. Calling someone selfish in the context of serious mental health issues can be hurtful and counterproductive.\n\nAlso, the friend's use of self-harm as leverage is concerning and indicates a need for professional help. The author might not be in the best position to handle this on their own. The situation highlights the complexity of balancing personal boundaries with concern for a friend's mental health. While the author has their own limits, the way they handled the conflict might have worsened the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent to set boundaries is understandable, but their method was flawed. They should have prioritized addressing the friend's mental health crisis over defending their stance on the gift. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not responding appropriately to their friend's emergency.\n"
