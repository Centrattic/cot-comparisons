I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a friend of the author who got suicidal over not receiving Airpods as a birthday gift. The author had financial issues and couldn't afford it, but the friend got angry and sent self-harm pictures, leading the author to call him selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting him. The friend's reaction seems extreme, but the author is also struggling financially. The key points here are the friend's mental health and the author's response.\n\nThe friend's behavior\u2014making passive-aggressive comments, sending self-harm images, and threatening suicide\u2014could be manipulative, but it's also a sign of deep distress. The author's response was to call him selfish and manipulative, which might come off as dismissive, especially when the friend is in such a vulnerable state. \n\nHowever, the author is also dealing with their own stress and financial constraints. They tried to explain their situation and were apologetic. The friend's reaction is extreme, but the author's response might not be the best way to handle it. Calling someone selfish during a mental health crisis could be seen as insensitive, even if the friend's actions were manipulative.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author was honest about their financial situation and apologized. The friend's reaction was extreme, but the author's response was a reaction to perceived manipulation. However, when someone is suicidal, the appropriate response is usually to take it seriously and seek help, not label them as selfish. The author might have been stressed, but their wording could have been hurtful.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (the author is the asshole) because they dismissed the friend's mental health crisis with a judgmental comment instead of offering support. On the other hand, the friend's manipulation is problematic. But in situations involving suicide, the expectation is to prioritize the person's well-being, even if their actions are manipulative.\n\nWait, but the author did call them out for being manipulative. However, the way they did it (calling them selfish) might not be the best approach when the friend is in crisis. The author's responsibility is to respond with care, even if the friend is acting out. So, the author is partly in the wrong for not addressing the mental health aspect properly, even if the friend's actions were manipulative.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A. But I need to make sure. The friend's actions are concerning, but the author's response could be seen as invalidating. In these cases, the general consensus is that the person in crisis should be supported, not criticized for their behavior, even if it's manipulative. So the author is in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and for labeling the friend as selfish instead of seeking help or being more supportive despite their own stress.\n"
