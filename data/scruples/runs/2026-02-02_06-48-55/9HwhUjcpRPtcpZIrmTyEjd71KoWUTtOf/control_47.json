I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend, who has been depressed, asked for Airpods as a birthday gift. The author couldn't afford it and said no, but the friend got angry, passive-aggressive, and even mentioned self-harm. The author then called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to an ignored conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is struggling financially and tried to be apologetic. They were already supporting their friend emotionally, which is taxing. The friend has a history of depression and may be acting out due to emotional distress. When the author refused the expensive gift, the friend escalated by bringing up self-harm and guilt-tripping.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's mental health and the author's response. The friend's behavior\u2014passive-aggressive comments, mentioning self-harm\u2014could be a cry for help rather than malicious intent. The author's reaction of calling them selfish might have been a momentary frustration, but they were in a vulnerable situation. However, even if the friend acted out, the author's response might have been harsh, considering the friend's mental state.\n\nBut wait, the author was already stressed from supporting the friend. They had a right to set boundaries, especially financially. However, using \"selfish\" and \"manipulative\" might have been hurtful, especially when the friend was in crisis. The author might not have handled it the best way, but they were under pressure.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions of threatening self-harm in a text conversation is serious. The author did try to support them, but the friend's escalation is concerning. The author's frustration could be justified, but the way they responded might have worsened the situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's mental health is a significant factor. However, the author's words might have been a mistake, but the context is complex. The friend's guilt-tripping and self-harm threats are problematic. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole. The answer depends on whether being honest about financial limits and expressing frustration in that context is wrong. Given the friend's mental state, the author's words could have been more compassionate. But the friend's behavior was manipulative. It's a tough call. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had a right to set boundaries, but the response could have been better. However, the friend's actions are more concerning. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the friend's manipulation is worse, but the author's reaction might still be questioned. Alternatively, the author could be in the wrong for not handling it more carefully. Hmm.\n"
