I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's friend who has depression and a history of being supported by the author. When the friend asked for expensive Airpods for his birthday, the author couldn't afford them and said no. The friend got upset, passive-aggressive, mentioned his mental health, and even sent self-harm images. The author then called him selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, the friend's mental state is a key factor. He has a history of depression and has been struggling. When he asked for an expensive gift, the author was honest about not being able to afford it. The friend's reaction, including threats of self-harm, is alarming and indicates possible crisis behavior. The author's response was to call him selfish, which might come off as dismissive given the context.\n\nEven though the author is also stressed and supporting the friend, the friend's actions (self-harm threats) could be a sign of needing help rather than a manipulation tactic. The author's friend might be acting out due to his depression, not necessarily to manipulate. However, the author's direct accusation of manipulation and selfishness could escalate the situation instead of addressing the underlying mental health issues.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is tricky. They have boundaries and financial limitations, which are valid. But when someone is in a mental health crisis, the immediate response should focus on support, not labeling. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the way they communicated it could be problematic because it might invalidate the friend's feelings and crisis.\n\nSo, considering the friend's mental state and the author's reaction, the author might be in the wrong for the way they responded, even if they were trying to set a boundary. The key is how the response affects the friend during a vulnerable time. The answer could lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because calling someone selfish when they're in crisis can be harmful, but there's nuance here. However, given the friend's actions and the author's direct accusation, the author's response might not be appropriate.\n"
