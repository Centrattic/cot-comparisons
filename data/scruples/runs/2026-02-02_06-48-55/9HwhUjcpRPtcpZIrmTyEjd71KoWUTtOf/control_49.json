I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who's been depressed, and the author is supporting them even though it's taking a toll on the author's mental health. The friend asks for expensive Airpods for his birthday, and the author can't afford them. The author says no, but the friend reacts poorly, even threatening suicide. The author then calls the friend selfish and manipulative, and the friend ignores them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a tough spot financially and has been giving a lot of support. They tried to be apologetic when saying they can't afford the Airpods. The friend has a history of depression and maybe feels entitled to expensive gifts based on past exchanges. But when the author can't comply, the friend threatens self-harm and guilt-trips. \n\nThe author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative. That's pretty harsh, especially when the friend is in emotional distress. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author's response might have been too direct and hurtful, especially considering the friend's mental state. The friend's suicide threats are serious and should be taken with high concern. Instead of calling them out, the author might have needed to express their own boundaries more compassionately and maybe encourage the friend to seek professional help.\n\nHowever, the author is also dealing with their own mental health from supporting a friend for a long time. They might feel overwhelmed and justified in setting boundaries. But reacting with labels like \"selfish\" during a crisis could escalate things. It's possible that the author's approach wasn't the best, but they might not be entirely wrong. The key is balancing support with self-care. But in this situation, the friend's life is at risk, so the author's response might be seen as lacking empathy. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is the asshole because they didn't handle the situation with enough care, given the friend's mental health crisis. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the friend's manipulative behavior justifies the author's response. But in such cases, even if someone is manipulative, you shouldn't belittle them when they're in crisis. So, the author's approach was poor, and they should have handled it differently. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
