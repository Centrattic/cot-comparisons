I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has depression and a history of self-harm. The author, who is struggling financially, couldn't afford the requested Airpods and politely declined. The friend then became angry, passive-aggressive, brought up self-harm, and mentioned suicidal thoughts. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to a day-long silence.\n\nFirst, consider the friend's mental health. He has a history of depression and self-harm, which are serious issues. His reaction to not getting the Airpods included self-harm and suicide threats. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author's response of calling him selfish might not have been the best approach, especially given the friend's mental state.\n\nThe author did express financial difficulties and apologized for not being able to afford the gift. The friend's response escalated the situation by bringing up self-harm. However, the author's reaction of labeling the friend as selfish and manipulative might have been harsh, especially in the context of the friend's mental health crisis. Instead of calling out the behavior, maybe the author should have focused on de-escalating the situation, expressing concern, or offering alternative forms of support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was clear about their financial constraints and tried to be polite. The friend's demands for an expensive gift, despite the author's clear inability to afford it, could be seen as selfish. But the key here is the friend's mental state. The author's response might have been a reaction to the stress of being guilt-tripped with suicide threats.\n\nIn such cases, it's important to prioritize the friend's mental health. The author might have been right to set boundaries but perhaps the way they communicated it was not ideal. The friend's behavior is concerning, but the author's response could have been more empathetic. The answer might hinge on balancing personal boundaries with the friend's needs. However, given the seriousness of the friend's actions (self-harm and suicide threats), the author's frustration is understandable, but their approach might have exacerbated the situation. So, the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if their intentions were to set boundaries.\n"
