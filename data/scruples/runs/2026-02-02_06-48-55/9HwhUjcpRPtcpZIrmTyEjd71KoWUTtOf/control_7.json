I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after the friend got suicidal over not receiving AirPods for their birthday. \n\nFirst, the friend has been dealing with depression for a while. The author has been trying to support them, which is taxing. The friend asked for AirPods, but the author couldn't afford them. The friend reacted angrily, made passive-aggressive comments, showed self-harm images, and threatened suicide. The author then called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to being ignored.\n\nNow, considering the context, the friend's actions are concerning. Self-harm and suicidal threats are serious and can't be taken lightly. The author did express their inability to afford the gift and apologized, but the friend's response seems extreme. However, the author's response of calling them selfish might have been hurtful. \n\nDepression can lead people to act out in ways they don't mean, but the author's friend's behavior was manipulative. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The friend's threats of suicide should have prompted a more empathetic and supportive response rather than a direct accusation. Even if the friend was being manipulative, the author's callout might have invalidated the friend's emotional state, which is dangerous given the history of depression.\n\nSo, the author might have been in a tough spot, but responding with \"selfish\" could have worsened the situation. The correct approach would be to address the friend's mental health concerns first, seek support, or involve professionals. The author might be in the wrong for not handling it more sensitively. Answer A.\n"
