I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for calling their friend selfish after the friend got suicidal over Airpods. The friend has been depressed, and the author has been supporting him, but now they're struggling financially. The friend wanted Airpods for his birthday, which the author couldn't afford. The friend got angry, made passive-aggressive comments about past gifts, and then sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The author responded by calling him selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is concerning. Self-harm and suicide threats are serious and should never be taken lightly. The author tried to be honest about their financial situation, which is reasonable. However, when the friend escalated to self-harm and suicidal comments, the author's response was to call them selfish. That might not be the best approach in a crisis. Even if the friend was being manipulative, the immediate priority should be addressing the friend's mental health emergency. The author could have acknowledged the friend's feelings, expressed concern, and maybe suggested getting help instead of confronting them about being selfish. The friend might be in a vulnerable state, and the author's reaction could have worsened the situation. So, the author might be in the wrong for not responding with more empathy and support during a crisis, even if they felt pressured. But the friend's actions are also problematic. However, in such cases, the person showing signs of self-harm and suicidal thoughts isn't the one in the wrong for that; the wrong lies in how the other person responded. So the answer is A.\n"
