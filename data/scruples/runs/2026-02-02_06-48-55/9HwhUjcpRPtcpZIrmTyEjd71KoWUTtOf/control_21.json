I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who has been depressed for a while. The author has been trying to support their friend, which is taking a toll on them mentally. Now, the friend wants Airpods for their birthday, but the author can't afford them. When the author says they can't, the friend gets angry and passive-aggressive, brings up past gifts, and even mentions self-harm and suicide. The author then calls the friend selfish and manipulative, and the friend ignores them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mental health aspect. The friend is dealing with depression, which can affect how they handle situations. The fact that they mentioned self-harm and suicide is serious. The author's response might have been a reaction to feeling manipulated or overwhelmed. But was it the right response?\n\nThe author is in a tough spot because they're already stretched thin supporting their friend. They might feel guilty for not being able to afford the gift, but they also have their own financial constraints. However, when the friend starts threatening self-harm, the appropriate response would usually be to address the self-harm first, not to accuse the friend of being selfish. \n\nCalling someone selfish when they're in crisis, even if they might be manipulating, could exacerbate their feelings. The author might have been frustrated, but the friend's life is at risk. The author should prioritize the friend's immediate well-being over financial concerns. Even if the friend is acting out, the author's response of labeling them selfish might not be helpful. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior is definitely manipulative and harmful. They're using their mental health to guilt-trip the author. But the author could have handled it differently, maybe by expressing their financial situation and offering alternative support without dismissing the friend's crisis. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author might not be the asshole because they're in a difficult position, but their response could be seen as not taking the friend's crisis seriously enough. However, considering the friend's self-harm and suicidal comments, the author's response might have been inconsiderate at that moment. But maybe the author wasn't in the wrong because they set a boundary. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the key is that when someone is threatening self-harm, the appropriate action is to take it seriously, not to call them selfish. So the author's response might be inappropriate even if they're justified in their frustration. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
