I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend with depression who got upset about not receiving Airpods for his birthday, leading to the author calling him selfish after he made suicidal comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting him. The friend asked for Airpods, which the author can't afford. The friend then got angry, made passive-aggressive comments about past gifts, and sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The author responded by calling him selfish and manipulative.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend is struggling with depression and has a history of self-harm. His reaction might be an emotional one, possibly exacerbated by his mental health. The author was honest about not being able to afford the gift, which is understandable. However, the friend's subsequent behavior\u2014bringing up self-harm and suicide\u2014is a serious red flag. \n\nThe author's response was to label the friend as selfish and manipulative. While the author might have felt pressured or guilty-tripped, calling someone selfish in the context of self-harm and suicidal ideation could be hurtful and dismissive of their mental health struggles. Even if the friend's approach was manipulative, the author's response might not have been the most helpful or empathetic. \n\nHowever, the author was also under financial stress and had been supporting the friend. It's a tough balance between setting boundaries and being supportive. But when someone is in crisis, especially with self-harm and suicide mentions, the priority should be addressing their well-being, not focusing on the gift. The author might have been stressed, but the response could have been more compassionate. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions of using emotional manipulation and self-harm to get what he wants is concerning. But the author's direct call-out might not have been the right approach in that moment. The author could have expressed their inability to buy the gift and then asked if the friend was okay, seeking help instead of assigning blame. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about intent and impact. The author's intent was to set a boundary, but the impact could have been harmful. However, it's also possible the author was overwhelmed and didn't know how to respond. Still, in such situations, it's generally advised to prioritize the person's safety and mental health. So, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the crisis properly and reacting with criticism instead of support.\n"
