I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend has been depressed, and the author has been supporting him, which is taking a toll. The friend wanted Airpods for his birthday, but the author can't afford them. The friend then got angry, passive-aggressive, and even sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The author called him selfish and manipulative, and the friend ignored them after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is dealing with depression, which can affect how they react to situations. However, the author is also in a tough spot financially. When the friend asked for something expensive, the author couldn't say yes. The friend then escalated the situation by bringing up past gifts, which the author points out were much cheaper. Then the friend started self-harming and threatening suicide. \n\nThe key here is how the author responded. The author was apologetic initially but then called the friend selfish and manipulative after the threats. Even though the friend's actions were concerning, the author's response was to accuse them of being selfish. That might have been a harsh reaction, especially given the friend's mental state. \n\nBut wait, the friend was using their mental health to guilt-trip the author into buying the Airpods. That's manipulation. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially when they can't afford to give that gift. However, when someone is in crisis and threatening self-harm or suicide, the standard response should be to take it seriously and offer support, not to call them names. \n\nSo, even if the friend was trying to guilt-trip the author, the appropriate response would be to express concern about the friend's well-being first. The author's reaction of calling the friend selfish might have been an overreaction, especially after the friend brought up the self-harm. The author should have focused on de-escalating the situation and checking on the friend's mental health rather than accusing them. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also dealing with their own stress from supporting the friend. They might be at their breaking point. But even so, when someone is suicidal, the priority is their safety. The author's response might have been a result of frustration, but the way they handled it could have made things worse. \n\nIn summary, while the friend's behavior was manipulative, the author's response of labeling them as selfish and manipulative, especially after the friend expressed suicidal thoughts, might not have been the best approach. The author should have addressed the friend's mental health concerns first. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for their response in that moment."
