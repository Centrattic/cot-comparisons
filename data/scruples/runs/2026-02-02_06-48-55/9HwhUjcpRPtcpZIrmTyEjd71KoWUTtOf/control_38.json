I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and the author had to tell them they can't afford Airpods for their birthday. The friend got angry, passive-aggressive, and then sent pictures of self-harm and suicidal comments. The author responded by calling them selfish and manipulative, then the friend ignored them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's response was appropriate. The friend's reaction escalated quickly from being upset about a gift to self-harm and suicidal threats. The author was already under financial stress and had been supportive, but this situation is tricky because the friend's mental health is a factor. \n\nCalling someone selfish when they're struggling with depression and self-harm might not be the best approach. Even if the friend was using guilt-tripping tactics, the author's response could have been more empathetic. The friend's actions, including the self-harm and suicidal comments, are serious and might indicate a crisis. In such cases, the appropriate response is usually to express concern and encourage seeking help, not to label them as selfish. \n\nThe author might be right to feel pressured, but reacting with that accusation could have made the friend feel misunderstood or dismissed, possibly worsening their mental state. The friend's behavior is harmful and concerning, but the author's approach in handling the situation may not have been supportive enough. \n\nHowever, the author was clearly in a difficult position financially and had been trying to support their friend. The line between standing one's ground and being compassionate is thin here. The key is whether the author's words were hurtful in a way that contributed to the friend's distress. \n\nConsidering the context, the friend's mental health issues are significant. The author should have prioritized addressing the emotional state of their friend rather than focusing on the perceived manipulation. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong for their response, even if the friend's actions were problematic. The correct approach would involve empathy and concern for the friend's well-being, not accusations of selfishness.\n"
