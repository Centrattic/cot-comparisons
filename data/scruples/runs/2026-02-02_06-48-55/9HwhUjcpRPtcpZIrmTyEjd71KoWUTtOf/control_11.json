I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is depressed, and the author is struggling with supporting their friend while dealing with financial issues. \n\nThe friend asked for Airpods as a birthday gift, but the author can't afford them. The friend then became upset, passive-aggressive, and even threatened suicide. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of both parties. The friend has a history of depression, which is a serious mental health issue. When someone threatened suicide, especially someone in a vulnerable state, the response should be handled with care. The author's friend might be using emotional manipulation to get what they want, but their mental health is a factor here.\n\nThe author mentioned they've been supporting their friend, which is taxing. It's important to note that while the author is in a difficult financial position, the friend's threat of suicide is a red flag. The author's response of calling the friend selfish and manipulative might be seen as dismissive, especially when the friend is already in a fragile state. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did express their inability to afford the gift and was apologetic. The friend's behavior escalated, including threatening self-harm. The author's frustration might be understandable, but reacting with accusations of selfishness could be hurtful in that context. \n\nI need to weigh the friend's mental health against the author's financial and emotional limits. The friend's actions could be a cry for help or attention, but the author might feel pressured. The key here is that when someone is suicidal, it's generally not appropriate to confront them with accusations, even if you feel manipulated. \n\nSo, considering that the friend's mental health is a critical aspect, the author's response might not be the best approach. However, the author is also in a tough spot. But in terms of right or wrong, calling someone selfish when they're threatening suicide could be seen as insensitive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
