I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend who has been depressed and another friend who tried to support him. The conflict arises when the depressed friend wants Airpods for his birthday, and the other can't afford it. The author called him selfish and manipulative after the friend made suicidal comments. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the mental health aspect. The friend has been depressed for a while, and this situation might be contributing to his emotional state. When someone is struggling with depression, their reactions can be more intense, and they might not handle stress or rejection well. \n\nThe author mentions they were already taxed mentally from supporting their friend. It's understandable to be in a tough spot financially, especially if they can't afford an expensive gift like Airpods. But when the friend starts making passive-aggressive comments and then brings up self-harm, the situation escalates. \n\nThe key point here is the author's response. They said the friend was being selfish and manipulative. Even if the friend was using emotional manipulation or guilt-tripping, responding with such direct accusations might not be the best approach, especially when the friend is already in a fragile state. \n\nHowever, the friend's behavior included self-harm and suicidal comments, which are serious. The author tried to set a boundary by explaining they couldn't afford the gift, but the friend didn't stop there and escalated the situation. In that case, the author might have felt cornered and reacted in frustration.\n\nDepression can cloud judgment for both the person experiencing it and those around them. The author might not have handled it perfectly, but they were trying to communicate their limits. On the other hand, the friend's actions (self-harm, suicidal comments) are concerning and might have been a cry for help rather than just manipulation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one causing the depression, but their response might not have been the most supportive. However, it's also important to recognize that the friend's actions were extreme and potentially harmful. The author's frustration might be valid given the ongoing stress of supporting a friend with depression.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did call the friend selfish, which could be seen as dismissive of the friend's emotional pain. But the friend's behavior was also a significant factor. The author was trying to set a boundary, which is okay, but the way they communicated it might have been harsh. \n\nI think the answer is a bit of both, but since the options are only A or B, I need to decide. The friend's self-harm and suicidal comments are serious, and the author might have been reacting to that stress. However, calling someone selfish in that moment might not be the best response. But given that the friend was making manipulative comments, the author was trying to assert their own limits. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were trying to communicate their limits and the friend escalated the situation with self-harm and suicidal threats. However, the response could have been more compassionate. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the circumstances, the answer is B.\n"
