I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA poster) is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who got suicidal over airpods after being told the author can't afford them.\n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while. The author has been supporting them, which is taking a toll mentally. The friend asked for Airpods for their birthday, but the author can't afford it. The friend reacts angrily, brings up past gifts (which were cheaper), and then starts sending images of self-harm. The author calls them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, considering mental health is super important. The friend's behavior, including threats of suicide and self-harm, is serious. The author might feel overwhelmed, but responding with \"selfish\" could be hurtful, especially when someone is in crisis. The author's frustration is valid because they can't afford it, but the way they handled the situation might not be the best. However, the friend's actions are also concerning. The author tried to set a boundary, which is okay, but maybe they could have handled the conversation more compassionately. The key points are the friend's mental state and the author's response. While the friend's behavior is extreme, the author's reaction might have exacerbated the situation. So, is the author in the wrong? They might have been right to set a boundary but could have approached it with more empathy. The friend's actions are more harmful, but the author's words were harsh. I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. Wait, but calling someone \"selfish\" when they're in a crisis might not be helpful. Maybe A is right? Hmm. This is tricky. I need to balance both perspectives. The author's stress is real, but the friend's mental health is critical. The author might not be the asshole, but their response was maybe too direct. I'm leaning towards B, but maybe A. Wait, in the community, often if someone is suicidal and manipulative, they might be the asshole. But the author could have de-escalated better. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
