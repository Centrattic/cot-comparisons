I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after calling their friend selfish when the friend got suicidal over not getting Airpods. \n\nFirst, the friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been trying to support them. The friend then asks for Airpods for their birthday. The author can't afford it and says no. The friend reacts with anger, passive-aggressiveness, and mentions self-harm. The author calls them out as selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's mental health and the author's response. The friend's history of depression is important. When someone is in a vulnerable state, reacting with guilt or threats of self-harm can be a cry for help. The author, while in a stressful situation, directly told the friend they were being selfish. That might have been harsh, especially considering the friend's mental state.\n\nHowever, the friend's behavior\u2014using self-harm as a bargaining chip\u2014could be seen as manipulative. The author might feel they were being taken advantage of. But calling someone selfish when they're suicidal might not be the best approach. It could come across as dismissive of their feelings, even if the author's intention was to set a boundary.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they were under financial stress and trying to set a limit. On the other, they didn't consider their friend's mental health in their response. The line between setting boundaries and being dismissive can be thin here. The friend's actions were concerning, but the author's response might have exacerbated the situation. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because, despite the friend's manipulative behavior, the author's harsh words might have worsened the friend's emotional state. Supporting someone's mental health requires empathy and understanding, even when their actions are frustrating. The author could have expressed their financial constraints without labeling the friend as selfish, which could have been more constructive.\n"
