I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for calling their friend selfish after a conflict over a birthday gift. The friend has a history of depression and tried to guilt the author into buying expensive Airpods by mentioning self-harm.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author is in a tough spot financially and was trying to be honest about not being able to afford Airpods. They were apologetic and tried to set boundaries. The friend, however, escalated the situation by bringing up self-harm, which is a serious red flag. The author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative, which might come off as harsh, especially given the friend's mental health issues.\n\nBut here's the key point: when someone is struggling with depression or has a history of self-harm, using that as leverage to manipulate others is problematic. The author was trying to stand their ground and not be guilted into spending money they don't have. While the friend's actions are concerning, the author's reaction of labeling them as selfish and manipulative is a way to set a boundary. The question is whether that labeling is justified in the context of the friend's mental health.\n\nHowever, the author's response might not have been the most supportive. Instead of calling the friend selfish, they could have expressed their financial constraints more clearly and offered alternative ways to celebrate the birthday without spending much. But the friend's behavior\u2014using self-harm as a tool to pressure the author\u2014is manipulative, regardless of their mental state. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did confront the manipulative behavior, which is reasonable. But they could have handled it more compassionately. However, since the friend's actions were inappropriate, the author's response might be justified. On Reddit, the community often sides with people who set boundaries, especially when others are being manipulative. The friend is the one using emotional manipulation and self-harm to get what they want, which is a serious issue. The author's frustration is understandable, and calling out the selfish behavior isn't necessarily wrong, even if the tone could be improved. \n\nIn the end, while the author could have handled it better, they weren't in the wrong for standing up for themselves and not being guilted into an expensive gift. The friend's actions were more problematic. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
