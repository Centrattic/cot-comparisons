I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend is depressed and has been getting support from the author. The friend asked for Airpods for his birthday, but the author can't afford them. The friend then gets upset, passive-aggressive, shows self-harm, and even mentions suicide. The author called him selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has a history of depression and self-harm, which is serious. The author has been supporting them, which is commendable, but they have financial constraints. The friend's reaction to not getting the expensive gift seems extreme. However, when someone is already struggling with mental health issues, their reactions might be more intense. \n\nThe author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, using that language in the moment, especially when the friend is in crisis, might not be helpful. It could have made the friend feel more isolated. The friend's threats of suicide are a red flag, and the author's response might have contributed to the friend pulling away. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also under stress from trying to support their friend while dealing with their own financial issues. It's possible they were overwhelmed and snapped. But in such situations, communication is key. Instead of labeling the friend as selfish, maybe the author could have tried to understand the friend's feelings better or suggested alternative ways to celebrate the birthday without spending a lot of money.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the friend's mental health is a critical factor here. The author's response, while maybe understandable under stress, could have been more empathetic. Calling someone selfish during a crisis might exacerbate their feelings of being unsupported, which is the opposite of what's needed. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their reaction, even if the friend's behavior was manipulative. The correct approach would be to address the underlying issues of depression and seek help, not to accuse the person of being selfish.\n"
