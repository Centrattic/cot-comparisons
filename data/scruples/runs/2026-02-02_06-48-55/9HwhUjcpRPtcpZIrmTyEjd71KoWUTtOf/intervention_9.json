I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend with depression who asked for expensive Airpods for his birthday, and the author, who's struggling financially, refused. The friend then got upset, made passive-aggressive comments, sent pictures of self-harm, and the author called him selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they've been supporting their friend for a while, which is taxing on them. They couldn't afford the Airpods and were apologetic. The friend, on the other hand, has depression and a history of self-harm, which is a serious mental health issue. The friend's reaction might be influenced by their depression, leading to emotional outbursts and self-harm as a coping mechanism.\n\nThe key points here are the use of self-harm as manipulation and the author's response. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative, which could be hurtful. Even if the friend's behavior was manipulative, using self-harm as a tactic is a red flag. However, the author's refusal to buy the Airpods might be seen as not being supportive, especially given the friend's mental state. But the author also has financial constraints and can't afford to give expensive gifts. \n\nBut wait, when someone is in a crisis, especially with self-harm and suicidal thoughts, the immediate reaction should be to prioritize their safety. The author might have been right to set a boundary, but calling the friend selfish in that moment could exacerbate the situation. The friend's actions\u2014using self-harm to guilt-trip\u2014definitely cross a line, but the author might not have handled it in the best way. They should have been more empathetic, perhaps, even while setting boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author was already stressed from supporting the friend and was honest about their financial situation. The friend's manipulation is problematic. But when someone threatens suicide, the appropriate response isn't to call them selfish. The author's frustration is understandable, but their response might have been inappropriate given the friend's mental health crisis. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for how they reacted. Even if the friend was manipulative, during a crisis, the focus should be on support and de-escalation. Calling someone selfish in that moment could worsen their mental state. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
