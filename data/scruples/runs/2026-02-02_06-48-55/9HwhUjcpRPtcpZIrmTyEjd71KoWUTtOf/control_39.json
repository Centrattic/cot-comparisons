I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's been depressed, and the author called him selfish after he reacted strongly to not getting Airpods for his birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend has been dealing with depression, and the author has been supporting him, which is taking a mental toll. The friend asked for an expensive gift (Airpods) during a time when the author is low on money. The author refused and apologized, but the friend got angry, passive-aggressive, and even mentioned self-harm and suicide. The author then called him selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to call their friend selfish. On one hand, the friend has a history of depression and made threats of self-harm, which are serious. On the other hand, the author is struggling financially and might feel manipulated by the friend's guilt-tripping.\n\nI should consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author has been supportive, which is commendable. However, when someone is in a vulnerable state (like depression), their reactions might not be rational. The friend's response to not getting the desired gift could be a sign of deeper issues, not just selfishness. The author's comment about the friend being selfish might have been a knee-jerk reaction under stress but could have been hurtful, especially if the friend is already struggling mentally.\n\nAlso, when someone threatens self-harm or suicide, the appropriate response is usually to be supportive and encourage them to seek help, not to accuse them of being selfish. The author's reaction might have worsened the situation instead of addressing the underlying problem. Even if the friend was manipulative, calling them out in that moment might not be the best approach, especially if it leads to the friend ignoring them, which could be harmful if they need support.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a difficult situation, managing their own financial stress and mental health from caring for a friend. It's possible they were overwhelmed and didn't handle it well. But in such cases, it's important to find a balance between self-care and supporting others without enabling harmful behavior.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be to set boundaries, the way they responded during a crisis might have been unhelpful and could be seen as dismissive of the friend's mental health struggles. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for calling their friend selfish in that context.\n"
