I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend with depression getting upset over not receiving Airpods as a birthday gift, leading to the author calling the friend selfish and manipulative.\n\nFirst, the friend has been dealing with depression for a while. The author has been trying to support them, which is commendable. However, the author is in a tough financial situation and couldn't afford the expensive gift. The friend, after being told they can't get Airpods, becomes angry and passive-aggressive, mentions past gifts (which were cheaper), and then threatens suicide. The author responds by calling the friend selfish and manipulative, and they ignore each other afterward.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's mental health and the author's reaction. When someone is struggling with depression, their actions can be influenced by their mental state. The friend's reaction might stem from deeper issues, not just the gift. The author, while in a financial bind, might have felt overwhelmed by the friend's behavior, especially given their history of support.\n\nHowever, calling someone selfish in a moment of crisis, especially when they're threatening self-harm, could be seen as insensitive. The author might have been trying to set boundaries, but the timing and context are crucial. The friend's mention of self-harm is a red flag that requires immediate concern, not a confrontation about being manipulative.\n\nThe author's apology and initial willingness to buy a gift show they cared. But the response to the friend's threats might have been harsh, potentially worsening the friend's distress. Even if the friend was manipulative, the right approach would be to address the emotional state first, seek help, or express concerns without attacking their character.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the friend's behavior was inappropriate and potentially harmful, the author's response might have been a breakdown under stress. The question is whether the author's words were justified. Using such strong language (\"selfish and manipulative\") when someone is threatening self-harm could be seen as dismissive of their real issues.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for the way they responded to the friend's crisis, even if the friend's demands were unreasonable. The priority in such situations should be the well-being of the person in distress, and the author's reaction could have been a failure to handle the situation with the necessary sensitivity.\n"
