I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who has been depressed and got suicidal after being told the author can't afford Airpods for his birthday.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression, which is important. The author has been supporting him, but now is in a financial bind. The friend asked for Airpods, the author refused, and the friend reacted angrily, sent self-harm images, and mentioned suicide. The author called the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to ignoring each other.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the friend's mental health, the author's refusal based on financial constraints, and the friend's extreme reaction. The author did apologize and tried to be understanding but was met with hostility and manipulation. The friend's threats of suicide and self-harm are serious issues. However, the author's response of calling the friend selfish might be seen as dismissive of the friend's emotional state. \n\nBut wait, the friend's behavior was manipulative and passive-aggressive, using past gifts to guilt-trip the author. The author was in a tough spot, financially limited, and trying to be honest. The friend's reaction escalating to self-harm and suicidal comments is concerning. The author called out the manipulation, which might be justified, but the way it was done could have been handled better. However, considering the friend's mental state, the author's harsh words might have contributed to the situation. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, is the author responsible for the friend's reaction? The friend's behavior was problematic, and the author tried to be honest. However, calling someone selfish during a mental health crisis could be seen as insensitive. The author might not be entirely at fault, but maybe there's a better way to handle it. However, the friend's manipulation is more to blame. The question is whether the author was wrong in calling the friend selfish. Given the context, the author was under pressure and tried to set a boundary, which is reasonable. The friend's actions are more concerning. So, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Another angle: the author could have approached it more empathetically without using the word \"selfish,\" but technically, the friend's manipulation is the main issue. So maybe the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
