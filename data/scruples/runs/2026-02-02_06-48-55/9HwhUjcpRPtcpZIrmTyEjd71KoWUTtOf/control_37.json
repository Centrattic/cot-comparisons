I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's been depressed, and the author is being asked for an expensive gift (Airpods) on their birthday. The friend got upset, mentioned self-harm, and the author called them selfish and manipulative. Now the friend ignored them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they're extremely low on money and can't afford expensive gifts. The friend has a history of depression and has been relying on the author's support. When the friend asked for Airpods, which are costly, the author said no. The friend then reacted with anger, passive-aggressive comments, and mentioned self-harm. The author's response was to accuse the friend of being selfish and manipulative.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend has a mental health issue (depression), which is a serious factor. The author is in a financially tight spot, which is also a valid concern. However, when the friend brought up self-harm, the author's immediate reaction was to label them as selfish and manipulative instead of addressing the emotional crisis. \n\nIn situations involving mental health, especially when someone is threatening self-harm, the appropriate response is usually to express concern, offer support, and possibly seek professional help. Accusing the person of being manipulative can come across as dismissive of their genuine emotional pain. Even if the author feels that the friend is using their depression to guilt-trip them, the priority in the moment should be the friend's well-being. \n\nHowever, the author is also under financial strain and has been supporting their friend for a long time, which is understandable. The problem arises in how they handled the situation when the friend escalated to self-harm threats. The author's reaction might have been a stress response, but it's possible that they could have handled it more compassionately. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior\u2014using self-harm as a tactic to guilt the author into compliance\u2014is problematic. But the author's response of calling them selfish might not have been the best approach. It's a delicate balance between respecting their own limits and ensuring the friend's safety.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's comment might have been hurtful and dismissive, especially during a crisis. While the author has valid reasons for not being able to afford the gift, their reaction to the friend's self-harm could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. However, some might argue that the friend's actions were manipulative, so the author had some justification. But in terms of the immediate situation, the author's response to self-harm with accusations is likely the issue here. Hence, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
