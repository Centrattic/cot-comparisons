I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend is depressed and has been suicidal. The author has been supporting him a lot, which is taking a toll mentally. When the friend asks for Airpods as a birthday present, the author can't afford it and says no. The friend gets angry, passive-aggressive, sends pictures of self-harm, and mentions suicide. The author then calls him selfish and manipulative, leading to being ignored.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mental health aspect. The friend has a history of depression and suicidal thoughts. When someone is in that state, their reactions might be more intense or triggered by things others might not expect. The author is in a tough spot because they're trying to support a friend but are also under financial stress.\n\nThe friend's reaction to the refusal for Airpods escalated into self-harm and suicidal comments. That's really serious. Even if the friend's request was about something like Airpods, using self-harm or suicide as leverage is a major issue. However, the friend's mental health is a critical factor here. Maybe they felt rejected or abandoned when the author couldn't meet the request, which could exacerbate their depression.\n\nThe author's response was to call the friend selfish and manipulative. While it's true that the friend might be using emotional manipulation (like guilt-tripping or threatening self-harm), the author's approach might not have been the best. Instead of calling them out directly, maybe a better approach would be to express empathy, reaffirm support, and perhaps set boundaries without attacking their character.\n\nHowever, the author is also stressed and low on money. They tried to be apologetic but the friend's reaction was extreme. The author's mental health is also affected by the friend's demands, so there's a balance here between supporting a friend and maintaining one's own well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend's use of suicidal threats is definitely manipulative and harmful. But the author's response of labeling them as selfish might have been harsh, especially given the friend's mental state. However, the author isn't obligated to spend money they don't have, especially when it's causing them stress. \n\nBut calling someone selfish in the context of their mental health struggles could be seen as insensitive. The author might have wanted to set a boundary, but the method might not have been the best. Maybe a more constructive approach would be to explain their financial situation without feeling they have to apologize, or to suggest alternative ways of celebrating without the Airpods. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend has a history of depression means that the author might not be fully aware of the underlying issues. The friend's reaction could be a symptom of their depression rather than intentional manipulation. In that case, the author's labeling them as selfish might be a misjudgment of the actual problem.\n\nSo considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they dismissed the friend's mental health crisis by calling them selfish, which could have worsened the situation. Instead of addressing the emotional manipulation, the author's response was confrontational, which might not be effective and could damage the friendship further.\n"
