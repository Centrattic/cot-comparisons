I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The situation is about a friend who gets suicidal after the author says they can't afford to buy him Airpods. The author supported the friend through depression but now feels taxed and called the friend selfish and manipulative after the friend tried to guilt-trip them into buying expensive gifts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been struggling with depression, and the author has been supportive. The friend wanted Airpods, which the author can't afford. The friend then becomes passive-aggressive, mentions past gifts, and even sends self-harm images and suicidal comments. The author responds by calling the friend selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's mental health history, the author's financial constraints, the friend's manipulation tactics (using past generosity and self-harm threats), and the author's reaction. \n\nOn one hand, the friend's behavior is concerning. Using threats of self-harm to guilt someone into spending money is manipulative and potentially harmful. The author might be justified in calling that out, especially if they're already strained from supporting the friend mentally. However, the author's response of labeling the friend as selfish might not be the best approach, especially considering the friend's mental state.\n\nBut the friend's actions\u2014bringing up self-harm and suicide\u2014raise red flags. The author should have perhaps prioritized addressing the friend's mental health crisis over the argument about gifts. However, the friend used those threats as leverage, which complicates things. The author might have felt cornered and reacted in frustration, but calling someone selfish in that moment could exacerbate the situation.\n\nStill, the author's main point is that they can't afford the gift and were trying to be honest. The friend's manipulation through self-harm is a serious issue. The author's response, while direct, might be seen as a momentary reaction to being manipulated, not a reflection of their support over time. However, in a crisis situation, the appropriate response would be to check on the friend's well-being first, perhaps de-escalate the situation, rather than confront them with accusations.\n\nBut given that the friend was already struggling and the author has been supportive, maybe the friend's manipulation is the main issue here. The author's frustration is understandable given their financial situation and the stress of supporting a friend. The friend's use of self-harm as a tactic is problematic, and the author might have felt justified in calling it out, even if the phrasing was harsh.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the friend's manipulation and the author's financial constraints, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, handling the situation with more empathy and addressing the mental health aspect first could have been better. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), as the friend's actions were manipulative.\n"
