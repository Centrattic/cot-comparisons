I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who's been depressed and the author is struggling financially. The friend wanted Airpods for his birthday, but the author couldn't afford them. The friend got upset, passive-aggressive, showed self-harm, and threatened suicide. The author called him selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression, which is a significant mental health issue. When someone is in a vulnerable state like that, their actions might be more impulsive or emotionally driven. The author's friend used self-harm and suicide threats as a reaction to not getting what he wanted for his birthday. That's pretty extreme. But does that make it right?\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a difficult financial situation and was honest about not being able to afford the Airpods. They were apologetic and tried to communicate their constraints. The friend, however, escalated the situation by bringing up past gifts and then threatening suicide. The author responded by calling the friend selfish and manipulative, which might have been a reaction to feeling manipulated or guilt-tripped by the friend's threats.\n\nIs it right to call someone selfish in this context? The friend's mental health is a factor here. Using self-harm and suicide as a bargaining chip to get what they want is a form of manipulation, even if the person is struggling. The author might have felt cornered, but the way they responded could have been hurtful. However, the friend's actions are also problematic. Threatening suicide as a reaction to not getting a gift is not healthy, regardless of their mental state.\n\nThe key points are: the author communicated their inability to buy the gift, the friend escalated with passive-aggressive behavior and suicide threats, and the author responded by labeling the friend as selfish. The author's financial situation is valid, but the friend's use of emotional manipulation is also an issue. However, when dealing with someone who has depression and a history of self-harm, the response should be more empathetic and cautious. Calling someone selfish in the midst of their mental health crisis might not be the best approach. The author might have been frustrated, but their friend's actions are inexcusable as well. \n\nSo, the author's response might not be entirely justified, but the friend's behavior is also wrong. However, since the question is about the author being in the wrong, considering the friend's mental health and the author's possible frustration, but the way they responded (calling the friend selfish) might have been dismissive of the friend's real issues. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility here. But I'm a bit torn because the friend's actions are clearly manipulative. But the author's response was to call them selfish, which could be seen as not taking their mental health seriously. So, maybe the author is in the wrong? Or is the friend more at fault? The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the friend's actions were extreme, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling manipulated, but their response might not have been the best. But in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the asshole because they communicated clearly and were honest. The friend's manipulation is more to blame. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
