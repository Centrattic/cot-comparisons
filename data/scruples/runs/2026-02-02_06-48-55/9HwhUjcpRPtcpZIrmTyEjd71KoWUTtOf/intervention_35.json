I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is the asshole. Let me break down what's happening here.\n\nThe friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been trying to support them. But the author is currently struggling financially. When the friend mentions wanting AirPods for their birthday, the author apologizes but says they can't afford it. The friend then gets angry, uses passive-aggressive comments about past gifts, which were about $10 each, but the friend is implying higher amounts. Then the friend starts sending pictures of self-harm and mentions suicidal thoughts. The author responds by calling them selfish and manipulative for trying to guilt them into buying an expensive gift, and the friend ignores them for the rest of the day.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the friend's actions. Self-harm and suicidal comments are serious and should not be taken lightly. Even if the friend is being passive-aggressive, the author's response of calling them selfish and manipulative might be seen as dismissive or invalidating. When someone is in a vulnerable state, especially with self-harm and suicidal ideation, it's crucial to approach the situation with empathy and concern rather than accusations.\n\nThe author did apologize for not being able to afford the gift, which is a valid response given their financial situation. However, the friend's reaction escalated quickly. The passive-aggressive remarks about past gifts might be a way to express underlying frustration, but the author's response of labeling them as selfish and manipulative could have worsened the situation. It's possible the friend was feeling overwhelmed by their depression and didn't handle the situation well, but that doesn't justify the behavior. On the other hand, the author's words might have been hurtful and could have made the friend feel misunderstood or judged, which is important in a supportive friendship.\n\nI should consider the dynamics of the friendship. If the friend has a history of depression, the author's role is to support them, not to argue about money. The author was already under stress from trying to support their friend, which might have led to a breaking point. However, when a friend is in crisis, the immediate reaction should be to address their well-being, not financial constraints. The line between standing your ground and being insensitive is thin here. \n\nThe author's statement that the friend is being manipulative by using their depression to guilt them into buying AirPods is a key point. While manipulation is possible, the friend's actions (self-harm, suicidal comments) are severe and require a different approach. The author should have prioritized their friend's mental health, perhaps by expressing their financial limits and redirecting the conversation to how they can support them in other ways, rather than accusing them of selfishness.\n\nIn crisis situations, people sometimes act out of character. The friend's usual way of handling things might be to push boundaries due to their depression. The author's response, while honest, might not have been the most compassionate in that moment. It's possible the author is also stressed and needs to take care of themselves, but the way they communicated their limits could have been more supportive.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they responded to their friend's crisis with a label that could be seen as dismissive. The friend's actions are concerning, but the author's reaction could have been hurtful and counterproductive. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
