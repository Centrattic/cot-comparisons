I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who's been depressed and the author who's been supporting them. The friend asked for expensive AirPods as a birthday gift, but the author couldn't afford it. The friend then got upset, made passive-aggressive comments, showed self-harm, and mentioned suicide. The author called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, the friend has a history of depression, which is a serious mental health issue. They might be in a vulnerable state. The author has been trying to support them, which is commendable, but now the situation escalated when the friend couldn't handle the refusal of an expensive gift. The author's friend is using emotional manipulation, including self-harm and suicidal comments, which are serious red flags. \n\nThe key here is how the author responded. They called the friend selfish and manipulative. While the friend's actions are manipulative, the author might not have handled it the best way. When someone is in crisis, especially with suicidal thoughts, the immediate response should focus on their well-being, not on calling them names. The author could have de-escalated the situation by offering alternative options, expressing concern for their friend's mental state, and perhaps seeking help. \n\nHowever, the author is also under stress from supporting their friend for a long time and being in a financial bind. They had a right to be honest about their inability to afford the gift. The problem is in the communication and the lack of addressing the friend's mental health crisis appropriately. Instead of labeling the friend as selfish, the author should have prioritized the friend's emotional state, maybe by suggesting other ways to celebrate the birthday without spending, or encouraging the friend to reach out to a professional.\n\nSo, while the friend's behavior is manipulative, the author's response could be seen as dismissive of their friend's mental health crisis. Calling someone selfish when they're in a vulnerable state, especially when they're self-harming and threatening suicide, isn't the right approach. The author should have focused on the friend's well-being first. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the immediate crisis and for the harsh words.\n"
