I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who was depressed and got suicidal when the author said they couldn't afford Airpods for his birthday. The author called him selfish and manipulative. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend has been depressed and the author has been trying to support him. The friend wanted Airpods, but the author couldn't afford them. The friend then got angry and passive-aggressive, mentioned their past gifts (which were cheaper), and then showed self-harm images and made suicidal comments. The author told them they were being selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nNow, considering if the author is wrong. The key point is how the author responded when the friend became manipulative. The friend used emotional manipulation by bringing up self-harm and suicidal thoughts. The author's reaction was to call them out on being selfish and manipulative. \n\nBut wait, even if the friend is manipulative, responding with an accusation like \"selfish\" might be harsh, especially when someone is in crisis. The author might have been right to set a boundary, but the way they did it could be seen as dismissive. However, the friend's actions (self-harm, suicide talk) are serious and the author was in a vulnerable position. \n\nAlso, the friend's behavior of using guilt and emotional leverage is problematic. The author was being honest about their financial situation, which is reasonable. But the friend escalating to self-harm is a red flag. The author's response might be a way to stop the manipulation, but calling someone selfish when they're in emotional distress could be unhelpful. \n\nHowever, the author might not be in the wrong because they were protecting their own limits and not giving in to manipulation. Still, in such situations, it's important to acknowledge the friend's pain without enabling manipulative behavior. The author's approach might have been too direct, leading to the friend ignoring them. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior is definitely problematic. Using self-harm as a tactic is manipulative, and the author was right to call them out. But the friend's mental health is a serious issue that might need professional help, not just a confrontation. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because setting boundaries is important. But they could have handled it more compassionately. However, the main question is whether they're \"in the wrong.\" Since the friend's actions were manipulative, the author's response, while harsh, was a reaction to that manipulation. So maybe the answer is B (not wrong), but it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nWait, but calling someone selfish when they're in crisis might be seen as insensitive. The author might have been right to set boundaries, but the method was poor. Still, the friend's manipulation is a bigger issue. The author's response was direct, but they were being honest about their situation. I think the answer is B.\n"
