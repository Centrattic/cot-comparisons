I've been trying my best to support him and make him feel better, so much so that it's taxing me mentally. \n\nToday he brought up the subject of his upcoming birthday and I asked him what he wanted. I'm extremely, extremely low on money right now so I wasn't wanting to buy him anything crazy.\n\nHe told me he wanted Airpods, and I told him I was sorry but I couldn't possibly afford those. I was extremely apologetic but he got pissed off anyways. \n\nHe got really passive-aggressive and started making comments about how he always got me what I wanted on my birthday. This is true, but I usually asked for things that totaled to around 10 bucks. He was adding an extra 0. \n\nThis had been a text conversation, and he soon started sending me pictures of fresh cuts on his arm. He complained that he would have a shitty birthday, just like always. He even commented on how he should just hang himself. I told him he was being selfish and manipulative of me by trying to guilt me into buying him such an expensive present, and he ignored me for the rest of the day. \n\nAmI the asshole here, or is he?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for calling their friend selfish after the friend got suicidal over not getting AirPods for their birthday. The friend has been depressed for a while, and the author has been supporting them, which is taking a toll mentally. The friend asked for AirPods, which the author can't afford. The friend got angry, passive-aggressive, sent pictures of self-harm, and mentioned suicide. The author then called them selfish and manipulative, leading to the friend ignoring them.\n\nFirst, the friend's mental health is a big factor here. Depression can lead to impulsive or harmful behaviors, like self-harm or suicidal thoughts. The friend's reaction might be an overreaction due to their mental state. The author is in a tough spot because they're trying to support a friend but can't afford expensive gifts, which is understandable given their financial situation. \n\nHowever, when the friend started sending self-harm images and mentioned suicide, the author's response was to call them selfish. Even if the author felt manipulated, the appropriate response in such a situation would be to express concern and offer support, not to accuse them of being selfish. The friend's mental health crisis takes precedence over the conflict about a gift. The author might be right to feel frustrated, but reacting with accusations during a time when the friend is in crisis could be seen as insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior does seem manipulative by using their mental health to guilt-trip the author into buying something expensive. But the line here is very thin. The author's responsibility is to ensure their friend's safety first. If the friend is in immediate danger, the author should prioritize that over the argument about the gift. The author might not have handled the situation well by not addressing the friend's mental health concerns first, especially when the friend escalated to self-harm and suicide talk. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author's immediate reaction to call the friend selfish without addressing the urgent mental health concerns might be the wrong approach. The friend's mental health is a critical issue here, and the author's response could come across as dismissive or uncaring, even if their financial situation is legitimate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not prioritizing their friend's safety and mental health over the conflict about the gift.\n"
