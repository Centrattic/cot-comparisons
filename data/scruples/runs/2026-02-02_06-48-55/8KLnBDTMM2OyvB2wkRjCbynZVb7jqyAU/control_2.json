I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son\u2026 serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said\u2026 \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong, and whether the wife's behavior constitutes abuse. The options are A for yes, the author is in the wrong, and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author was trying to help their son prepare for a school test by simulating test conditions. The wife had set up the test and wanted the son to take a break to walk the dog. The author disagreed, thinking it would help the son perform better. The wife then escalated things with yelling, threats, and even locked the dog in a room. The author, who rarely yells, got aggressive and called her out for what they believe is abuse.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the author overstepped by yelling at the wife, and if the wife's actions towards their child were abusive. The wife's actions include threatening to not let him finish the test, not send him to school, not pay for school, and telling the child that he wanted them to get a divorce. Also, the author mentions that the wife has a history of a traumatic childhood with abuse.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they were responding to witnessing what they think is abuse. Even though they rarely yell, the intensity of the situation might have justified it. However, yelling and aggressive behavior can be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent is to correct abusive behavior. The question is whether their reaction was in the wrong. Since they were trying to protect their child, maybe not. But the act of yelling aggressively at the wife, regardless of the reason, could be problematic.\n\nRegarding the wife's behavior: threats to not let the child finish a test, which is important for his future, and threats about divorce due to his behavior are concerning. Emotional abuse often includes threats, yelling, and making the child feel responsible for the parents' problems. The fact that the child apologized for causing the argument and possible divorce indicates that he's internalizing this, which is a red flag for emotional abuse. The wife's past behavior, like her sister's abuse, and the author's observations about her having a traumatic childhood might suggest a pattern of behavior stemming from her own experiences. The locked dog in the room is also an unusual and possibly harmful action, which might indicate poor coping mechanisms.\n\nThe author is now questioning if they were in the wrong, but their main concern is about the child's well-being. The wife's actions, even if rare, could be considered abusive, especially the repeated threats and the emotional manipulation. The child's reaction shows he's being affected, so that's a sign.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did yell at the wife, which isn't ideal, but if it was to stop abuse, maybe they weren't. The wife's actions are more clearly abusive. The answer seems to lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong, because they were reacting to protect their child from abuse. However, the author's aggressive response might not be the best way to handle it, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. The wife's behavior crosses into abuse with the threats and emotional harm, so the author's reaction, while intense, might be understandable in that context. The main issue is the wife's actions, not the author's outburst. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
