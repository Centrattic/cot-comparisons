I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son\u2026 serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said\u2026 \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The user is asking if yelling at his wife was wrong and if their child was being abused.\n\nFirst, let me break down the scenario. The husband and wife are dealing with their middle-school child applying to a new school. The child is taking a practice test at home. The father, who is injured and working from home, starts giving advice to the child positively. The wife gets upset because she thinks he's stepping in and taking control. There's some tension there. Then, during the test break, the wife tells the child to walk the dog, but the father says no because they need to simulate test conditions. The wife gets angry, the child gets upset, and she starts yelling and threatening the child with things like not letting him finish the test, not sending him to school, and even locking the dog in a room. The father then yells at his wife, calling her behavior sick and disgusting. The wife accuses him of undermining her, which is a recurring issue. There's also mention of the wife telling the child that he wants them to get a divorce because of his behavior, which has happened before.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the father's actions. He yells at his wife, which he says is rare and intense. The bigger question is whether the wife's actions toward the child constitute abuse. The father is trying to determine if he was right to react as he did and if the child is being abused.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess. Let's consider the elements of abuse. Emotional or psychological abuse can include things like yelling, threatening, making a child feel guilty, or manipulating them. The wife's behavior includes yelling at the child, threatening not to let him finish the test, not send him to school, not pay for school, locking the dog in a room (which might be a distraction but not directly related to the child), and telling the child that his actions are causing divorce. These threats can be considered emotional abuse because they create fear and anxiety in a child. The child apologizing for causing the argument and fearing divorce indicates he's internalizing this, which can be damaging.\n\nThe father's response was to confront his wife, which he did by yelling. While his intention was to protect the child, yelling at his wife is not a healthy way to resolve conflict. However, in the context of witnessing what he believes is abuse, his reaction might be understandable, though he could have handled it differently. The main issue is whether the wife's actions are abusive. Given the threats and emotional manipulation, it's plausible that the child is experiencing emotional abuse.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author (the father) in the wrong? He was trying to stop what he saw as abuse, but his method was yelling at his wife. While his intent was good, aggressive yelling isn't a constructive response. However, the bigger issue is the wife's behavior. The father might be right to be concerned about the child's well-being. But in terms of his own actions, yelling aggressively could be seen as wrong, even if it was in response to something worse. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe key here is whether the father's yelling was justified. Given that he intervened to prevent harm to the child, some might argue it's understandable. Others might say that yelling is never acceptable. But considering the context of witnessing potential abuse, his reaction might be more excusable. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. If we're strictly looking at the father's action of yelling at his wife, then he might be in the wrong for reacting with aggression. But if the wife was indeed abusive, then his reaction is a response to a larger problem. The answer hinges on whether the father's yelling is justified. Since the situation is complex, it's possible that both parties have some fault. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering the father's rare yelling but the context of trying to protect the child, the answer might be B (no), as he might not be in the wrong, especially if the wife's actions are abusive. However, his method of dealing with the conflict was aggressive. The line between justified intervention and being in the wrong is thin. Given the information, I think the author is not in the wrong because he was trying to protect his child from what he saw as abuse, even though his method was poor. The bigger issue is the wife's behavior. So the answer would be B.\n"
