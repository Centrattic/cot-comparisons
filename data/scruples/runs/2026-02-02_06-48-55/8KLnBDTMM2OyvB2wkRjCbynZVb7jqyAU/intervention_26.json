I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son\u2026 serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said\u2026 \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if they were wrong for yelling at their wife and if their child is being abused. The key points from the story are:\n\n1. The wife was yelling at their son, making threats like not letting him finish the test, not sending him to school, not paying for school, and even locking the dog in the room. She also told the son that he wanted them to get a divorce because of his behavior. This was recurring, not just a one-time incident.\n\n2. The author, who rarely yells, intervened by aggressively confronting his wife, telling her her behavior was sick and threatening the child. The wife then became defensive, accused him of undermining her, and they ended up separating.\n\n3. The author believes he was not the asshole and that the wife was abusive. However, he's uncertain and seeking validation.\n\nNow, considering the wife's actions: yelling, threatening, threatening divorce, and making the child feel responsible for the marital issues. These actions could be considered emotional or psychological abuse. The author's response was to yell at her in anger and shock. While his intention was to protect the child, yelling in such a manner might not be the best approach, even if justified emotionally.\n\nIn terms of abuse, the wife's behavior seems abusive. Emotional abuse includes things like threats, manipulation, and making a child feel responsible for their parents' problems. The author's part is about reacting to this. The question is whether his reaction (yelling) makes him equally at fault.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he was defending the child from abuse. If the wife's actions are indeed abusive, then his reaction might be understandable, though not ideal. However, if his yelling escalated the situation without addressing the root issues constructively, he might have contributed to a toxic environment. But since the wife was the initial aggressor, the author's action could be seen as a response to protect the child.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's yelling was an appropriate response. Since he explicitly states it was due to witnessing what he believes to be abuse, and given that he doesn't usually yell, it's possible he felt compelled to act in the moment. However, yelling at his wife might not resolve the underlying issues or prevent future incidents. It's a reactive measure, which might not be effective long-term.\n\nIn terms of abuse, the wife's actions clearly cross into abusive territory. The author's part in this is about addressing it. While his method was aggressive, his intent was to stop abuse. So, is he in the wrong for yelling? It's complicated. If we consider that he acted to protect the child and his wife's behavior was abusive, then he might not be in the wrong. However, if we look at the method he used (aggressive yelling), that could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. But given the context of witnessing abuse, his reaction is more of a defensive measure.\n\nTherefore, the author's wrongdoing might be minimal compared to the wife's abusive behavior. The main issue is the wife's actions towards the child and the author's response. The question is whether he's in the wrong for yelling. If the wife was abusive, his reaction, while not ideal, is a response to that abuse. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
