I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son\u2026 serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said\u2026 \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent who was injured and working from home. Their child is applying to a new school and was taking a practice test. The author wanted to help prep the child, but the wife got upset. Then during the test break, the wife told the child to walk the dog, but the author said no to maintain test conditions. The wife then had a big tantrum, yelled at the child, made threats like not letting him finish the test or pay for school, locked the dog in the room, and even told the child he wanted them to divorce because of his behavior. The author then yelled at the wife, calling her actions \"sick\" and counterproductive. Now the author is wondering if they did wrong and if the wife's actions are abuse.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if they are the asshole for yelling at their wife and if the wife was abusive to their child. The key points here are the wife's behavior towards their child. Let's break down the wife's actions: yelling, threatening to not let the child finish the test or attend school, threatening not to pay for school, locking the dog in the room (though that's more about the dog than the child), and telling the child he wants the parents to divorce because of his behavior. Also, the child apologized for causing the argument and potential divorce, which the author finds upsetting.\n\nThe author argues that they were trying to help the child and that the wife's behavior was abusive. The wife's actions seem to fit emotional abuse or at least emotional mistreatment of the child. Threats and yelling can be considered emotional abuse, especially if done regularly. The part about the child being manipulated into thinking he caused the divorce is gaslighting, which is a form of emotional abuse. The author intervened because they witnessed what they believe is abuse.\n\nNow, the author's response was to yell at the wife. The author mentions they rarely yell, and this was in response to witnessing what they believe is abuse. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of the author's actions, yelling at the wife, even if it's rare, can be seen as aggressive. However, the context is that the author felt compelled to act because of the wife's behavior towards the child. If the author's primary intention was to stop what they perceived as abuse, their actions might be seen as a protective measure. However, yelling is still a form of aggression and might not be the best approach, but the intent matters. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The other part is whether the wife's behavior is abuse. If the wife's actions are indeed abusive, then the author's response could be justified as trying to stop the abuse, even if it was done in a confrontational way. However, in some contexts, even if the wife was abusive, the author's yelling could still be problematic if it's not a proportionate response. But given that the author says they rarely yell, maybe it's a one-time reaction to a specific incident.\n\nThe key factors here are the wife's actions towards the child and the author's response. The wife's behavior seems to meet the criteria for emotional abuse, especially with the threats and manipulation. The author's yelling at the wife, while not ideal, was in response to witnessing what they believe is abuse. The author is also expressing concern for the child's well-being.\n\nIn this context, the author might not be in the wrong, as they were trying to protect their child from what they perceive as abuse. However, the situation is complex. The author's yelling is a form of conflict escalation, which could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. However, if the wife's actions are genuinely abusive, then the author's response is a reaction to that. \n\nSo, considering the wife's behavior and the author's intent, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The author's action (yelling) is a negative one, but the context is a potential child abuse situation. The community might have mixed views, but if the author's primary concern was the child's welfare, then their action is a response to that. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
