I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son\u2026 serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said\u2026 \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out step by step. The question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for yelling at his wife and if their child is being abused.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's wife and he are both involved in helping their middle-school son apply to a new school. The son was taking an at-home test to simulate real conditions. The wife had set it up, but the author was trying to help as well. The wife got angry and argued with the author. When their son took a break, the wife told him to walk the dog, but the author said no to keep the test simulation realistic. The wife then had a big tantrum, screamed at the son, made threats about not letting him finish the test, not sending him to school, not paying for school, locked the dog in its room, and told the son that he wanted to cause a divorce because of his behavior. The author, who rarely yells, got angry and confronted his wife, calling her behavior \"sick\" and \"disgusting.\" Now the wife is sleeping in another room and the author is seeking validation that this was abuse.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n1. The wife's behavior towards the child: yelling, threats, emotional manipulation (saying he caused the divorce). These actions are concerning. Emotional abuse can include verbal attacks, threats, and using divorce as a weapon against a child. The threats to not let him finish the test, not send him to school, and not pay for it could be considered counterproductive and harmful. Locking the dog in the room is odd, but maybe a sign of frustration. The mention of divorce being blamed on the child is a red flag for emotional abuse.\n\n2. The author's reaction: He yelled at his wife because he felt she was abusive towards the child. He usually doesn't yell, but this time he did. His intention was to stop the abuse. However, yelling at someone, even if in response to their behavior, can be seen as aggressive and potentially unhelpful, especially if it leads to further conflict.\n\n3. The wife's history: She has a traumatic childhood with verbal and emotional abuse. The author has noticed her sister acting abusively towards her child. The wife's history may contribute to her current behavior, but that doesn't excuse it. The author feels she is gaslighting him, which might involve manipulation and denial of the problem.\n\n4. The child's response: The son apologized for causing the argument and mentioned divorce. This shows the child is internalizing the conflict and the wife's words, which is harmful.\n\nNow, considering psychological abuse in children: Emotional abuse includes actions that harm a child's self-esteem, provoke fear, or make them feel responsible for adult problems. The wife's threats and blaming the son for marital issues fit into this. The son is in middle school, so he's old enough to understand such statements, making the emotional impact significant.\n\nThe author's yelling at his wife: While it's a bad approach, if he was trying to stop her from abusing their child, maybe his intent was protective. However, yelling might not be the best way to address the issue. He might have contributed to the conflict escalation, but the focus is on whether he was wrong in doing so to prevent abuse.\n\nIs the wife abusing the child? The threats and emotional manipulation likely meet the criteria for emotional abuse. The author is concerned, and the son's reaction supports that. Gaslighting the father and deflecting blame onto the child further indicates manipulative behavior.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for yelling? His yelling was in response to witnessing what he perceives as abuse. If his wife was indeed abusive, his reaction might be understandable, though not ideal. However, the author could have handled it in a calmer, more constructive way. The fact that he rarely yells is a point in his favor, but the act itself is still aggressive. The main issue here is the wife's conduct towards the child.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the wife's behavior is likely abusive towards the child, and the author's response, while aggressive, was to stop potential abuse. The author's intention was protective, even if the method wasn't perfect. The real problem is the wife's actions, not the author's reaction.\n"
