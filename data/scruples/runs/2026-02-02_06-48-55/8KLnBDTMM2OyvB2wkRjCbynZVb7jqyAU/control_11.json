I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son\u2026 serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said\u2026 \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to go through the situation carefully. The author is a parent who was injured and working from home. Their child is applying to a new school and taking a practice test. The wife was handling the setup, but the author tried to help, which the wife was upset about. Then during the test break, the wife told the son to walk the dog, but the author said no to maintain test conditions. The wife then had a meltdown, yelling at the son and making threats. The author intervened by yelling at the wife, which is why they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main questions are whether the author was wrong to yell at the wife and if the wife's actions constitute abuse. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they rarely yell, but this time they did. The context was that the wife was threatening the child and acting out in anger. The author felt it was necessary to confront her. But is yelling an appropriate response, even in such a situation? Yelling can be seen as aggressive, regardless of the intent. However, the author might argue it was to stop potential abuse.\n\nThen, the wife's behavior: she screamed, threw a temper tantrum, threatened the child with not finishing the test, not being sent to school, not paying for it, locked the dog in a room, and told the son that he wanted them to get a divorce. These actions are concerning. Threatening a child, especially with divorce, can be emotional abuse. Yelling and screaming at a child, especially middle-school age, can be emotional abuse as well. The author is right to be worried here.\n\nBut the author's intervention: while their intent was to protect the child, the method was yelling. The question is whether that's acceptable. Some might say that any yelling is wrong, but others might see it as a justified reaction to witnessing possible abuse. The key is whether the author's response was proportional. The wife was already in a heated state, and the author's aggressive yelling might have escalated things further. However, the alternative is that they were trying to stop an abusive situation.\n\nRegarding the child's apology for causing the argument and possible divorce, that indicates the child is internalizing the conflict, which is a sign of emotional distress and possible abuse.\n\nNow, the author is also asking if the wife's actions are abuse. The threats and yelling, combined with past instances, could be considered emotional abuse. However, whether it's \"clear\" abuse might depend on cultural or legal definitions. In many contexts, consistent threats and yelling at a child are considered forms of emotional abuse.\n\nThe author's part in this: they tried to help the child, which the wife resented. The author's yelling was in response to the wife's behavior. The author might be in the right in stopping the abuse, but their method (yelling) is questionable. However, the wife's actions are more clearly problematic. So the author might not be in the wrong for yelling if it was to protect the child, even if yelling isn't ideal.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author possibly undermining the wife's authority, which could lead to conflict. However, the wife's response was extreme, so maybe the author's intervention was necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's yelling might not be the best approach, the more significant issue is the wife's behavior. The author is likely not in the wrong, given the circumstances. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
