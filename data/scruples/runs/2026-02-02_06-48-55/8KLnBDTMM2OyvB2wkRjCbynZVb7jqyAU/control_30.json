I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son\u2026 serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said\u2026 \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for yelling at his wife and if their child is being abused.\n\nFirst, the author says he rarely yells but did so because he saw his wife yelling and threatening their son. He mentions she screamed, shouted, made threats, and even locked the dog in the room. The threats included not letting the son finish the test, not sending him to school, not paying for it, and saying the kid wants them to divorce because of his behavior. The author intervened by aggressively confronting her, which led to her sleeping in another room.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong. He was reacting to what he perceived as abuse. Yelling at someone else in anger is usually a bad move, but if he was trying to stop his wife from harming their child, maybe he had a justifiable reason. However, his response was \"aggressive\" and he used strong words like calling her behavior \"sick\" and \"disgusting.\" That could escalate the conflict instead of resolving it. But given the context, if the wife was actually abusive, his reaction might be understandable, even if not appropriate.\n\nNext, the second part: is the wife abusing their child? The threats she made\u2014denying him the test, not sending him to school, not paying for it, and divorce due to his behavior\u2014seem like emotional abuse or psychological maltreatment. Emotional abuse includes actions that harm a child's self-worth or emotional well-being, such as threats, humiliation, or excessive punishment. Also, saying the child wants a divorce and that it's his fault is manipulative and harmful. Locking the dog in a room might be a red herring but maybe shows a loss of control. The author's son apologizing for causing their argument suggests he's internalizing the conflict, which is a sign of emotional impact.\n\nThe author mentions his wife has a history of a traumatic childhood with abuse and that he's been gaslighted. Gaslighting might mean she's deflecting blame, but he's trying to protect their son. The key here is whether the wife's actions cross into abuse. The threats and yelling could be considered emotional abuse, especially if they're frequent or severe. Since the author's post is on a forum like AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community usually looks for whether the actions were clearly wrong. \n\nThe author's own yelling is a point of contention. While it's not good, if he was trying to stop abuse, maybe it's understandable. But does that make him right? The community often emphasizes addressing issues without aggression and through communication. The wife's behavior is clearly concerning, but the author's method of confrontation might have contributed to the problem. \n\nHowever, the main issue is the wife's actions. Threats and yelling at a child are typically seen as abusive. The author is justified in being upset, but his aggressive response could be seen as the wrong approach. The question is whether he's the asshole for yelling at her, even if her actions might be abusive. \n\nThe answer might be B for the author not being in the wrong for yelling, as he's trying to protect his child from what he perceives as abuse. But the community might say he should have handled it differently. However, the wife's behavior is definitely abusive. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong and if the child was abused. The answer for the author's part is B (not in the wrong) because he's reacting to protect, but the wife's actions are abusive. But the user also wants to know if the child is being abused, which is a yes, so maybe the answer is B, the author is not the asshole, and the wife is abusive.\n"
