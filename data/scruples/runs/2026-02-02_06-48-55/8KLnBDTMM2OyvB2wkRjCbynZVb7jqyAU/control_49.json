I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son\u2026 serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said\u2026 \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's start by breaking down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong, and whether their child was abused. The answer options are A (yes, the author is in the wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario step by step. The author describes a conflict that arose during their child's school test preparation. The main issue seems to be the intense yelling at the wife and the wife's subsequent behavior towards their son, which included threats and yelling. The author is questioning their own actions and whether their wife's actions constitute abuse.\n\nLet me start by considering the author's actions. The author mentions that they rarely yell but did so aggressively in this instance. The catalyst was witnessing their wife's behavior towards their son, which they perceived as abusive. The author's outburst was in response to seeing their child being threatened and yelled at. Now, while yelling is generally not advisable, the context here is that the author felt compelled to act because they believed their child was being harmed. However, using aggressive yelling as a response could be seen as a poor choice of action, even if the intent was to stop abuse. But the key question here is whether the author is in the wrong for that.\n\nNext, the more critical part is assessing whether the wife's actions towards the child constitute abuse. The wife allegedly threatened not to let the child finish the test, not send him to school, not pay for school, locked the dog in a room (though the dog might not be the child, but there's a mention of the child being upset and running to the bathroom), and told the child that he wanted the parents to divorce because of his behavior. These are serious actions. Threats can be a form of emotional or psychological abuse, especially when directed at a child. The mention that the wife has a history of a traumatic childhood involving abuse and has a sister who has acted abusively towards her child adds context. The child apologizing for causing the argument and fear of divorce is also a red flag, as it indicates the child is internalizing the conflict and possibly experiencing anxiety or guilt, which are signs of emotional harm.\n\nNow, the author's perspective is that they intervened because they saw abuse happening. Their aggressive yelling was a reaction to what they witnessed. The question is whether their reaction is justified. While the wife's actions may indeed be abusive, the author's response of intense yelling could be considered an escalation. However, the author's intent was to stop what they perceived as abuse, which complicates the assessment. The key point is that the author is trying to protect the child, even if their method of confrontation was aggressive.\n\nLooking at the wife's behavior: threats, yelling, emotional manipulation (divorce accusations), and possible emotional abuse. These are generally recognized as forms of child abuse or at least harmful parenting practices. The fact that the wife has a history of this kind of behavior and that the child is showing signs of distress (apologizing for causing the argument and fear of divorce) supports the claim that abuse might be occurring.\n\nNow, the author's act of yelling at the wife. If the wife's behavior was indeed abusive, then the author's intervention, while aggressive, could be seen as an attempt to correct harmful behavior. However, yelling is not a constructive way to handle such a situation and could contribute to a hostile environment. But the author is not the one perpetuating the abuse against the child; they are reacting to it. Therefore, while the method of intervention (yelling) is problematic, the underlying reason (trying to stop abuse) may mitigate the wrongness of their action.\n\nConsidering the options: Answer A (author is in the wrong) would imply that the author's aggressive yelling was inappropriate regardless of the context. Answer B (author is not in the wrong) would suggest that their reaction was justified given the circumstances.\n\nThe more important part is whether the child was abused. If the wife's actions meet the definition of abuse, then the author's intervention, even if poorly handled, is a response to something more serious. In many legal and psychological contexts, threats, yelling, and inducing fear in a child are considered forms of emotional abuse. The child's apology for causing the conflict and fear of divorce are indicators of emotional harm. The wife's past behavior and the author's observations about her trauma history further support the likelihood of abuse.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for reacting to what they perceived as abuse, even if their method was aggressive. The wife's actions are more concerning and likely constitute abuse. Therefore, the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
