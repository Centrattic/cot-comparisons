I do not yell much, hardly ever, but when I do it's intense. \n\n\nMy middle-school child is applying to a new school. He is deep in the (rushed) application process and was setup to take an at-home version of the test so we could simulate real-world test conditions and give him a feel for what taking the lengthy test would be like. \n\n\nCoincidentally, I am injured and needed to work from home that day. \n\n\nWhen he got home, I immediately - with positivity, enthusiasm, and good intentions - started giving him advice, prepping him, kind of psyching him up. I noticed my wife seemed irked about this, pointing out how she had everything under control and already setup. Historically she gets irritated if she perceives I am \"stepping in and taking control.\" \n\n\n* Or at least that's what she says. I don't really understand why she would be upset that I was trying to help our child?\n\n\nAt any rate, he starts the test - and after about 80 minutes get his first five minute break. She tells him to \"go walk the dog,\" and I said no, we need to simulate the test conditions and he should be able to take the break that will best help him with the remainder of the test. She got angry, heated, and argued that he needed to get out of the house. She ordered him to do so and he ran to the bathroom clearly upset. \n\n\nThen she essentially lost it, screaming, shouting, and throwing a huge temper tantrum - presumably because she felt I had \"overruled\" her and our son wasn't complying. (More on this general concept later).\n\n\nAt this point, I went back to where I was nursing my injury and she just lit into our son\u2026 serious yelling, serious screaming, and lots of threats:\n\n\n* Threatened not to let him finish the test.\n\n* Threatened not to send him to school.\n\n* Threatened not to pay for school.\n\n* Locked the barking dog in his room (!?!?).\n\n* And something else.\n\n\nI had heard enough and aggressively walked to where she was and lit into her, telling her that her behavior was **sick**, that it was disgusting, that she cannot scream and yell and threaten him like that, and how counterproductive it was considering we were trying to simulate real test conditions, and that this clearly wasn't going to help him take the test and score well. \n\n\nAs I said, I yell very rarely - she was at first either shocked or scared or both. Then, though, she became heated again (though she backed down) and said that I was undermining her - this is a common refrain. She behaves like that, I make clear it's not appropriate, and she accuses me of not supporting her. \n\n\nSo am AITA for yelling at her, and more importantly, was she abusing our child?\n\n\nI'm curious if those things above, in isolation, are unambiguously considered abuse. \n\n\nI mentioned something else. \n\n\nIn addition to all the threats I listed above, she also told my son (again, a middle-schooler) that he wanted us to get a divorce and it was going to happen because of his behavior. In fact, she has told him this a couple other times in the past. \n\n\nWith that said, AITA and is that abuse? I feel strongly that I was not the asshole and that I was witness to abuse. Do you agree? Is this clear abuse? Or can it simply be chalked up to anger on her part? My outburst can clearly be ascribed to anger, shock, and disgust - witnessing - and realizing you are witnessing the (likely) abuse of your own child. \n\n\nOver the more than a decade I have known my wife she has slowly - very slowly - acknowledged her very traumatic childhood - one filled with emotional and verbal abuse. I have witnessed her sister act abusively towards her child. But with the yelling at my son it is really the first time I truly noticed the abuse she is/may be exposing my son to. \n\n\nI think, further, that to some degree I have been gas lighted. Not in a weak, victimized manner. And frankly I hate that newest psychology phrase.  With that said\u2026 \n\n\n* She is clearly pissed at me now, but not about her behavior I am assuming, instead about my reaction to her behavior. She is sleeping in another room.\n\n* Were I to speak to her about the situation, the result would (like clockwork) be the following:\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She would strive to out-argue me. \n* She would tell me I'm wrong.\n* She would blame our son for instigating things.\n* She would blame me for supporting him and undermining her. \n* Whenever a conversation devolves into an argument, reason goes out the door and she simply out-argues me. Period. I have found that very frustrating over the years. \u000b\n\n    &lt;hr&gt;\n\n* She routinely tells me I am undermining her to our son. Maybe occasionally I do, but most often he'll tell me something she's done and I'll simply support him. I also routinely speak highly and positively of his mother/my wife when he tells me these things: telling him she's not angry with him, but instead me; telling him she's only behaving a particular way because that's what she was exposed to; reminding him of the many ways she's a great mom; always telling him that he's an amazing child.\u000bNote that these \"incidents\" occur very infrequently, but they do occur. \n\n* When I have fired back that her behavior was bad and he brought it to my attention, she has said he is manipulating me to get what he wants, presumably more lenient treatment. \n\n* She has accused me of coddling him in the past, occasionally says he's a \"wimp\" - though not to him I hope - because he doesn't handle her anger well and if she's going-off on him I'll step in and stop it. This, too, happens only very rarely. \u000b\n\n* She's also particularly sensitive to me \"overruling\" her - as though anything and everything she says must be both (1) adhered-to, and (2) 100% supported by me. This seems pretty unrealistic to me. \n\nI hadn't intended to write a thesis. Perhaps it has been cathartic for me. \n\nMany of you may view my post with disdain - wondering how I can be so unsure if this is abuse or not - and I still don't know for sure whether that is the definitive consensus. \n\n\nTrust me. When you're in it, it's not so easy to tell.  \n\n\nWhat's more, this is only part of the story. She is for the most part a great mother - I think - she just has these moments that I believe haunt her from childhood - and behaves towards our child in ways that are clearly not in his best interest - in ways that I'm assuming she was treated when she was young.  \n\n\np.s. My son apologized to me later in the day for causing our argument and potentially our divorce. That fucking upsets me so much and makes me realize this is doing damage. I don't understand why I'm turning to strangers to help me understand and verify that this is in fact abuse. \n\n\nThank you in advance for your replies. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a parent who was injured and working from home. Their child is applying to a new school and taking a practice test. The author was trying to help the child by giving advice and setting up the test environment. The wife, however, seemed upset and felt the author was stepping in. The author mentions the wife has a history of getting irritated when he takes control.\n\nThen, during the test, the wife told the child to take a break and walk the dog. The author disagreed, wanting to simulate proper test conditions, leading to an argument. The wife then allegedly had a tantrum, yelling at the child, making threats about school, and even locking a dog in a room. The author then intervened by yelling at the wife, calling her behavior \"sick\" and confronting her about threatening the child. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong and if the wife's actions constitute abuse.\n\nSo, the main points here are the wife's behavior towards the child and the author's reaction. The author is asking if he was wrong to yell at the wife and if the wife's actions are abusive to the child.\n\nLooking at the wife's actions: threatening not to let the child finish the test, threatening not to send him to school, threatening not to pay for school, locking the dog in the room, and telling the child that he wants the parents to divorce and that it's his fault. These are serious. Threats can be considered emotional abuse, especially if they're used to intimidate or control a child. The author claims the wife has a history of emotional abuse from her own childhood and may be projecting that behavior onto their child.\n\nThe author's response was to yell at the wife. He says he rarely yells, but this time he did because he was witnessing what he believes is abuse. The question is whether his yelling was justified. \n\nIn terms of parenting, using threats and yelling at a child can be harmful. The wife's actions seem to cross the line into emotional abuse. However, the author's method of confronting the wife by yelling might not be the most effective or safe way to handle the situation. While his intent was to protect the child, yelling at the wife might escalate conflict rather than resolve it. The author could have addressed the situation in a calmer manner, perhaps by documenting the incidents and seeking professional help, like family counseling.\n\nThe author also mentions that the wife tends to deflect blame, argue, and gaslight him. This pattern of behavior from the wife suggests a deeper issue that might need professional intervention. The author's role in this is to protect the child, but using aggressive yelling might not be the best approach. It could also model poor conflict resolution for the child.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the wife's actions are concerning and may indeed be abusive. The author's reaction was driven by a desire to protect the child, but his method of handling the conflict (yelling) could be seen as inappropriate. The author is not in the wrong for recognizing the potential abuse, but his method of confronting the wife may not be the best approach. However, given the context and the wife's behavior, it's possible the author is acting in the child's best interest, even if his method is flawed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the method of confrontation could be improved. The key issue is the wife's behavior being potentially abusive, and the author's intent to stop that.\n"
