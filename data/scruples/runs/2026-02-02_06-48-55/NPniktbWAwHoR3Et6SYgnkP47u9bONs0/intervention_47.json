We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their girlfriend living together, and the girlfriend is upset when the author wants to play games. The author's argument is that the girlfriend doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. The girlfriend feels neglected because when he's gaming, she has nothing to do, and she wants to make her own plans in advance. The author responds by suggesting she can watch him play or use his laptop, but she ends up going to her sister's house, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author wants to game with friends, which is a common activity, especially for people who enjoy gaming. However, the girlfriend feels that her time is being taken up when he's gaming, leading her to go out, which might be her way of coping with feeling left out. The author's initial approach was to let the girlfriend know he's playing, but she expects pre-planning, which he resists. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author might not be in the wrong if he's expressing his need to have personal time, which is valid. However, the girlfriend's feelings of neglect are also important. The author's response to her feelings by suggesting she use his laptop or watch him play might not address her emotional needs. She might need more quality time or a better balance between his gaming and their time together. \n\nBut the user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because the author dismisses her feelings by saying she \"doesn't need to go out\" and instead suggests passive activities like using the phone. The girlfriend's need for attention and her reaction of going to her sister's house could indicate deeper issues of feeling ignored. The author's refusal to accommodate her request for pre-planning might be seen as not respecting her needs, leading to repeated arguments. \n\nHowever, the author is also within his rights to want personal time. The problem might lie in how the communication is handled. The author could be more proactive in finding a compromise, like setting specific gaming times where she knows she can have her own space, or ensuring that they spend quality time together when he's not gaming. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he has legitimate needs too. But maybe he's not fully addressing her emotional needs. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house repeatedly might show that the current approach isn't working. The author's response to her feelings might be dismissive, which is where he might be at fault. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he's not adequately addressing her feelings of neglect and is dismissive of her need for pre-planning, which could be a way for her to manage her expectations and time. The author's solution of \"just relax\" might not take into account her emotional state. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not finding a more balanced approach that respects both his and her needs.\n"
