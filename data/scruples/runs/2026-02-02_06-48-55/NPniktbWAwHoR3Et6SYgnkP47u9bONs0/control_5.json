We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (who's a guy) and his girlfriend. They live together, have been together three years. He plays games with friends, and she's upset because he doesn't plan his gaming time in advance so she can make her own plans. He says he just wants to game without having to coordinate every time, and she wants him to plan so she can do things when he's busy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend is feeling neglected, maybe? Since they live together, she might expect more quality time or joint activities. The author, on the other hand, wants to maintain some personal time with friends through gaming. He mentions that she's the type who wants constant attention, which he's okay with, but he also wants his own space.\n\nThe key points: The author didn't plan his gaming time, leading to conflicts. He tells her she doesn't need to make plans every time he plays. She wants him to plan in advance so she can go out. He argues that she doesn't have to go out but can just relax. The problem is the communication and expectations. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not entirely. It's normal for couples to have differing needs. However, the fact that the girlfriend felt the need to go to her sister's house because she felt left out might indicate that her emotional needs aren't being met. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to go out every time could be dismissive of her feelings. \n\nBut also, the author is trying to balance his own interests. The real issue might be about communication and finding a middle ground. If they can't agree, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could be more considerate. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might depend on societal expectations of relationships. In many cases, partners are expected to make compromises. The author's refusal to plan and his dismissive attitude might be seen as not considering her feelings, which could make him partly at fault. But it's a nuanced situation. \n\nLooking at AITA posts, often the answer is about balance. If the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author is not acknowledging her need for separate activities, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he's being selfish, then yes. However, he's also expressing his need for personal time. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's a matter of differing expectations, but both need to communicate better. The author isn't wrong for wanting his own time, but he could be more accommodating. The key is mutual respect. Since he's trying to explain his perspective and she's not getting it, maybe he's not at fault. But the fact that she's going out and he's gaming without considering her feelings might tip it to A. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. But given the context, perhaps the answer is B because it's a matter of differing needs and not necessarily one person being wrong. Both need to adjust, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting personal time.\n"
