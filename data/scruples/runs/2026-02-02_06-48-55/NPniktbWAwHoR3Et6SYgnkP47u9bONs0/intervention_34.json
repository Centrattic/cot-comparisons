We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting him to pre-plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans, and he's saying she doesn't need to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author and his girlfriend live together and have been together three years. He used to spend his alone time gaming, but now that they live together, he wants to game, and she's upset because she feels neglected. She wants him to let her know in advance so she can have her own activities. He told her she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax on her phone or use his laptop. She went to her sister's house a few times, leading to arguments.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author mentions that he's been in the relationship for three years and that he's fine with her wanting constant attention. However, he also wants time to game with friends. The problem arises because she's expecting him to plan his gaming so she can plan her activities. He sees it as her overreacting, while she sees it as not considering her needs.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and consideration are important. The author's initial refusal to plan ahead might have caused frustration because it's not just about him gaming, but about her having her own space or activities. Even if he's okay with her being around while he plays, she might need her own time to feel balanced. The fact that she went to her sister's house multiple times suggests she's trying to create space for herself, which the author might not be acknowledging.\n\nWhen he told her she doesn't need to make plans every time, maybe he didn't consider that she might need some independence. The fact that she's \"the kinda girl who wants constant attention\" could mean that without structured time apart, she feels smothered or neglected. His response of \"just relax and chill on your phone\" might dismiss her need for more than just passive presence.\n\nOn the other hand, he's also expressing his need for personal time, which is valid. However, how he communicates this might be an issue. Instead of dismissing her plans, maybe a better approach would be to find middle ground, like setting specific times when they can have individual activities, or discussing expectations upfront.\n\nThe author's main point is that he's not making plans that require her to do something, just suggesting she can be on her phone. But if she's feeling that even his gaming time is affecting her, maybe he needs to be more considerate of her emotional needs. Even if she's in the same room, she might need her own space mentally and physically.\n\nIn relationships, it's about balance. The author might not be in the wrong because he's expressing his need for personal time, but he's not considering her perspective adequately. The girlfriend's reaction is about her need for autonomy, which is also valid. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are respectful of her boundaries. If he's not acknowledging her need for space, that's a problem. But if he's trying to communicate his own needs, it's a two-way issue.\n\nThe author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time might be dismissive of her attempts to manage their cohabitation. Living together requires negotiation of personal space and shared time. If she's feeling that her autonomy is being infringed upon, then the author's approach could be the issue. He should be more proactive in discussing boundaries and finding solutions that work for both of them, rather than insisting she just \"chill.\"\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not fully considering his girlfriend's need for personal space and is dismissing her attempts to manage her own time. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
