We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author and his girlfriend living together. The issue arises when the author wants to play games with friends, and his girlfriend feels left out. She wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans when he's gaming. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time and can just relax or use his laptop.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that when they live separately, she gets time alone when he's gaming. Now that they live together, she feels like she's missing out because he's gaming and she has nothing to do. She wants to have her own activities when he's busy. The author, on the other hand, thinks that she's overreacting and that she can just use her phone or relax. He's trying to balance his gaming time with their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When they moved in together, their living arrangements changed, so their dynamics might need adjustment. The girlfriend is expressing her need for personal time, which is valid. The author, however, is trying to maintain his gaming hobby with friends, which is also reasonable. The problem is that they haven't found a middle ground.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings might be dismissive. By saying she doesn't need to make plans every time, he's not acknowledging her need for independence. Even if she's fine with using her phone, she might prefer to have her own space or activities, which is a common desire in a relationship. The author could be seen as not considering her feelings enough, especially since he's making plans with friends and expecting her to just be okay with being alone in the house.\n\nOn the flip side, the author isn't doing anything wrong per se. Gaming is a legitimate way to spend free time, and it's not inherently wrong to want to play with friends. However, the key is mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend feels neglected, the author should be more considerate. The fact that she went to her sister's house for a few hours shows she's unhappy and looking for space, which the author might not be fully recognizing.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area, but since the girlfriend is expressing a valid need and the author isn't addressing it adequately, he might be partially at fault. However, he's also not malicious; he's trying to balance his interests. The answer could depend on cultural norms and relationship standards. But generally, in relationships, both partners need to communicate and find a compromise. The author's dismissal of her need to make plans could be seen as the issue here. Therefore, he might be in the wrong, but not entirely. Hmm. The options are A for yes and B for no. I think it's B, no, because both sides have valid points. But the author could be seen as not considering her feelings enough. Wait, the girlfriend's reaction is about her needing time, and the author's response is dismissive. So maybe A (yes, he's in the wrong). But I'm not sure. The user wants a clear answer. Let me check similar AITA posts. Often, if one person's hobby affects the other's comfort, they need to adjust. Here, the author isn't making it a plan but expects her to be okay alone. Since he's the one initiating the gaming, he should consider her feelings. So answer A: yes, he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her need for personal time and is dismissing her feelings.\n"
