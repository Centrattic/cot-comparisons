We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is a guy who lives with his girlfriend. They've been together for three years. He used to game a lot but took a break. Now that they live together, he wants to play games again. The issue is that when he starts gaming, his girlfriend wants to make plans to be busy because she's not into gaming and doesn't want to sit around doing nothing. He told her she doesn't need to make plans every time he games. She goes to her sister's house, and this becomes a recurring argument. He defends it by saying she can watch him play or use her phone/laptop, but she wants more interaction. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual respect. The author's argument is that he's just trying to game with friends, and he's not going anywhere, so she can just relax. The girlfriend feels neglected when he's focused on gaming and wants to have her own plans. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to maintain his hobby and personal time. However, the girlfriend is feeling like she's not getting enough attention. When they first started dating, he gave up his time for her, so now she's expecting him to consider her time when they live together. \n\nThe problem arises when the author dismisses her feelings by telling her she doesn't need to make plans. Even though he offers alternatives like watching or using her phone, she's not satisfied. The author's response might not be validating her feelings. Instead of finding a middle ground, he's setting boundaries that don't consider her emotional needs. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to balance their individual needs. The author is asserting his right to game, but the girlfriend is expressing her need for companionship. The author's solution of \"just relax and chill\" might not address her deeper need for connection. Maybe he could have suggested specific times for gaming where they can have separate activities but still be together, or find a compromise that allows both his gaming and her to have things to do. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might be a sign of feeling excluded, which is a valid emotion. The author's initial joke about her watching him play might have been dismissive of her feelings. The fact that this becomes a recurring argument suggests that his approach isn't working. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both sides have valid points. The author is trying to maintain his hobby, but the girlfriend's feelings of neglect are also important. However, the author's response of telling her she doesn't need to plan might come off as not taking her feelings seriously. He should consider her perspective and find a solution that makes both of them comfortable. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't adequately address his girlfriend's feelings and needs, leading to repeated conflict. The answer is A.\n"
