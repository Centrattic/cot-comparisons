We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting plans made whenever he wants to game, and the author is pushing back.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together three years and has been living together for four months. The author used to game alone when they were apart, but now that they live together, the girlfriend is upset when he wants to play without her making plans. She feels neglected and wants to be busy when he's gaming. The author thinks she's overreacting and that she can just relax or use his laptop.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a right to his free time, especially with friends. Gaming is a common hobby. However, the girlfriend might feel that their living together means they should spend more time together, and when he's gaming, she's left with nothing. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans every time, but maybe he's not considering her feelings. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author might be seen as dismissive if he's not acknowledging her need for attention. Even if the author wants alone time, it's important to validate her feelings. The problem is that when they were apart, he had his own time, but now that they live together, boundaries might need adjustment. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might be a cry for help or a way to get space. The author's insistence that she just relax might not address her desire for social plans. Maybe he's not wrong in wanting to game, but the way he's handling the conflict might be part of the issue. \n\nIn relationships, balance is key. The author is not entirely in the wrong for wanting to game, but he might need to find a better way to communicate and compromise. However, according to the scenario, he's standing his ground and not making room for her needs. The answer might hinge on whether the author is being unreasonable by not considering her perspective.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because he's asserting his hobbies, but if he's not listening to her feelings, maybe he is. But the question is if he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions (leaving for sister's) might indicate she's not getting her needs met. The author's response of telling her to relax might not be sufficient. However, the act of gaming itself isn't the issue. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is defending his right to game, but there's a nuance. However, in the context of AITA, usually, if someone is being dismissive of their partner's feelings, they might be considered in the wrong. Wait, but the author is trying to balance his own needs and hers. The problem is the girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic. The author isn't wrong to say she doesn't have to make plans every time, but maybe he needs to find a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is the one making demands that the author finds unreasonable, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries around his gaming time.\n"
