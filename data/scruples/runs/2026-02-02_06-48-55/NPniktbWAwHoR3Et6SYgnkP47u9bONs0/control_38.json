We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo the author and his girlfriend live together. They've been together three years. The issue is about gaming time. When they started living together, the author wanted to play Apex Legends with a friend. He told his girlfriend he was going to play, and she was upset because she felt she needed to have plans when he was gaming. She didn't want to be alone, so she went to her sister's house. This led to arguments a few times. The author tried to tell her she could watch him play, talk, or just relax on her phone. He even gave her advanced notice sometimes, but if she didn't have plans, she blamed him. The author says she wants constant attention but he also wants to game with friends.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is that he's not going anywhere and that she doesn't need to leave. He wants to spend time with his friends and play games, which is a common hobby. On the other hand, his girlfriend feels neglected when he's gaming. She wants to have plans when he's busy, so she doesn't feel alone. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author did mention his plans, but maybe not in a way that considered her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she's not comfortable being alone when he's occupied. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to leave, but she might need more active inclusion or reassurance. \n\nHowever, the author is also within his rights to want personal time. The problem seems to be about balancing individual needs. The girlfriend might need to express her feelings more clearly, while the author might need to be more considerate of her emotional needs. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's asserting his right to personal time, which is valid, but if his actions are causing his partner distress without considering her perspective, that could be an issue. However, the girlfriend's approach of blaming him when she doesn't make plans might not be fair. \n\nIn relationships, mutual understanding is important. The author might not be in the wrong because he's trying to communicate that she doesn't need to leave, but maybe he could find a middle ground. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering both sides, I think the answer is B (No), because he's not inherently wrong for wanting his own time, but both could work on communication. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. But the AITA format often leans towards one side. The author might not be in the wrong because he's not forcing her to leave, just explaining that she doesn't have to. So B.\n"
