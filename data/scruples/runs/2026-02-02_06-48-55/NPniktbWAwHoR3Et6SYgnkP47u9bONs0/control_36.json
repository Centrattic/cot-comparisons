We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author playing video games and their girlfriend wanting to have plans when he's gaming. The author says he's telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author and his girlfriend live together and have been together for three years. They were spending time apart before moving in, and now with more time together, the girlfriend is feeling neglected when he plays games. She wants to make plans to be busy while he's gaming. The author thinks she doesn't need to go out, just relax or use her phone. He's also mentioned she's the type who wants constant attention, but he also wants his own time to play with friends.\n\nThe key points here are communication, mutual respect of boundaries, and understanding each other's needs. The girlfriend is expressing that she feels ignored or left out when he's gaming. The author is trying to assert his own need for personal time. The problem seems to be a lack of compromise. The author's response to her feelings might not be validating enough. He dismissed her request by saying she can just relax or use her phone, which might not address her need for social interaction or personal time that she's used to. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house multiple times could be seen as a way to avoid conflict but might not be the healthiest approach. She's trying to set boundaries by leaving, but the author isn't acknowledging her feelings. The author's argument is that gaming isn't a \"plan,\" so she doesn't need to make plans in response. But maybe he's not considering that she might feel like she needs her own space or activities when he's occupied, especially since they live together now.\n\nIn relationships, it's important both partners feel heard and respected. The author could be in the wrong if he's dismissing her valid feelings. However, he's also entitled to his own time. The issue here might be that neither is fully compromising. The girlfriend wants her own time, and the author wants his own time, but their methods of handling it are conflicting. \n\nThe author's response to her concerns is dismissive. Instead of acknowledging her feelings and working together to find a solution, he tells her she doesn't need to go out and that she can just relax. This might not validate her need for social plans. The girlfriend might need to express her feelings more clearly, but the author's approach could be contributing to the problem by not addressing her emotional needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is partially in the wrong because he's not adequately addressing his girlfriend's needs and is dismissing her valid request for personal space. However, it's a mutual issue. But based on the question, the focus is on whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's refusing to acknowledge her need for plans and is making her leave, maybe he's not considering her perspective enough. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, he's in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. The question is whether he's wrong for telling her she doesn't need to make plans. If she's feeling that she needs that to not feel neglected, then he's not respecting her needs. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
