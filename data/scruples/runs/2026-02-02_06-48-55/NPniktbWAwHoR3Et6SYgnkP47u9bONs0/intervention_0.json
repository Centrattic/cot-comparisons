We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The situation is about the girlfriend expecting them to plan their gaming time so she can make plans, and the author telling her she doesn't need to go out every time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions they live together and have been together for three years. Initially, they gave up a lot of free time for dates, but now with living together, they want to game. The girlfriend is upset because when he plays, she feels she has nothing to do and wants to make plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out each time and can just relax.\n\nThe author's main point is that they want to game with friends without having to plan around her making separate plans. The girlfriend feels left out and wants attention. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both perspectives.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The girlfriend feels she's not getting enough attention when he's gaming. The author is trying to balance his own need for downtime with her emotional needs. The problem arises when the expectations aren't met. The author might not have considered that even if they're together, she might need her own space or activities. However, the author is also asserting their right to personal time, which is valid.\n\nBut maybe the way the author dismissed her feelings by saying she can just use her phone or the laptop isn't helpful. It's possible he's not acknowledging her need for companionship. The girlfriend might be feeling neglected, especially if she's used to more attention. The author's reaction of telling her she doesn't need to plan and to just relax might not address her emotional needs. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. Both need to communicate better. However, the author isn't entirely wrong in wanting personal time, but perhaps could have been more considerate of her feelings. So, the answer might be a balance, but based on the options given (A or B), if the user is saying the author is in the wrong, but others might think B. However, considering the girlfriend's feelings and the author's dismissive attitude, maybe A is correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mutual issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be A because he's not being considerate of her feelings, but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
