We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. He wants to play games with his friends, and his girlfriend is upset because she feels like she has nothing to do when he's gaming. She wants him to inform her in advance so she can make plans to do something else, like go out or something. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans just because he's playing games, and he tells her to relax or use her phone or laptop. They ended up arguing a few times because of this.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is that he's just playing games, which he used to do before they lived together, and maybe he's not doing anything wrong by continuing that. But the girlfriend's perspective is that since they live together now, when he's gaming, she's stuck at home without anything to do. She's asking him to let her know in advance so she can plan her time. That seems like a reasonable request, right? If you live together, you have to balance your individual time with each other's needs. \n\nThe author mentions that he gave her the option to watch him play or use his laptop. But maybe she feels like that's not sufficient. If she wants to go out or have her own activities, she needs advance notice. The problem here seems to be communication and mutual understanding. The author might be prioritizing his own free time without considering that his girlfriend might feel neglected or have her own needs for social interaction or personal space. \n\nBut wait, he also says she blames him when she fails to make plans. So maybe she's holding him responsible for her not being able to do things. That could be an issue. However, the author's response of telling her she doesn't have to go out every time might be dismissive of her feelings. It's possible he's not acknowledging her need for engagement or her desire to have her own time, which is fair. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should feel that their needs are being considered. If the girlfriend is feeling that she's missing out on social activities because he's gaming, and she's asking for advance notice, the author should probably be more accommodating. His reaction of saying she doesn't need to make plans and just relax might come off as not taking her feelings seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also entitled to his personal time. Gaming is his way of relaxing and connecting with friends. The challenge is finding a balance. Maybe the solution is to communicate better, set some boundaries, and find a compromise. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he dismissed her request and didn't take her feelings into account, he might be at fault here. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't adequately address his girlfriend's feelings and her need for plans, leading to repeated arguments. He should have been more understanding and found a middle ground instead of being dismissive.\n"
