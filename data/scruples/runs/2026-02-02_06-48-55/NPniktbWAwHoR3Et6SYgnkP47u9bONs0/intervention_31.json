We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together, and he wants to play games with friends. The girlfriend is upset because she feels like she has nothing to do when he's gaming. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans for her own time every time he wants to play.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that they've been together for three years and he's given up a lot of his time for their relationship. Now that they live together, he wants some personal time gaming. He tried to communicate that he's just playing and it's not a formal plan, but the girlfriend felt neglected. She wanted to be included or have her own plans when he's busy. The author told her she could just relax and use her phone or laptop, but she's the type to want constant attention.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author says he gave her advanced notice sometimes, but she still felt she needed to plan her own activities. The girlfriend might feel that her emotional needs aren't being met when he's gaming, even if he's nearby. The author, on the other hand, sees gaming as his personal time and doesn't want her to feel like she has to do something every time.\n\nIn a relationship, both partners need to balance their individual needs with the relationship's needs. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering his girlfriend's feelings of loneliness when he's gaming. Even if he's not doing anything wrong, his actions could be causing her distress. However, he's also entitled to his own hobbies and downtime. The problem might be more about how they're communicating their expectations. If the author didn't realize that his gaming time was making her feel isolated, that's one thing, but if he's dismissive of her feelings, that's another.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house for hours could be a sign of how upset she is, but perhaps she could have addressed it more calmly. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time might be dismissive of her need for attention. It's possible that both sides have valid points but aren't fully understanding each other's perspectives. The author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging that his gaming time affects her emotionally, even if he doesn't intend for it to. A healthy relationship requires compromise, and maybe the author isn't compromising enough here. He could try to find a middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming where they can have some alone time together and other times when they can each have independent activities without pressure. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I think there's a case to be made that he is, because he's not fully considering her emotional needs and his actions are causing conflict.\n"
