We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. He wants to play Apex Legends with his friends, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels like she has nothing to do when he's gaming. She wants him to plan his game time so she can make her own plans. He told her she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, just relax or use the laptop. She's the type who wants constant attention, and he likes that, but he also wants to game. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, communication seems important here. The author mentions that he didn't expect her reaction because before, they used the Xbox just for streaming. Now he's using it for gaming, which she didn't anticipate. Maybe he didn't talk to her about how he wanted to balance his gaming time with her time. When he did start gaming, he told her he was going to play, but she felt neglected. She went to her sister's house, which suggests she felt upset enough to leave. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans every time. But she's asking for a plan to have something to do, which he dismisses. However, the fact that she's going to her sister's house when he's gaming might indicate that she needs space or feels lonely. The author says she wants constant attention, but maybe her reaction is about needing her own time or activities when he's occupied. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to maintain his gaming hobby and social connections, which is understandable. But the girlfriend's need for engagement or plans might not be met if he's focused on gaming. The key point is whether the author considered her feelings and needs when setting boundaries. \n\nHe mentioned that she blamed him when she failed to make plans, which might be a communication issue on both sides. The author's solution of telling her to chill or use the laptop could be dismissive of her feelings. Couples need to balance each other's needs, so maybe the author didn't fully address her concerns. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel heard. While he's not wrong for wanting to game, not acknowledging her need for plans or finding a compromise could be where he's in the wrong. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't adequately address her feelings or work together to find a solution that satisfies both.\n"
