We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. Let's look at the situation and the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for three years and lives together now. The author mentions that when they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, but now that they live together, he wants to game with his friends. The girlfriend seems to feel that when he's gaming, she's left with nothing to do and wants to plan something so they can spend time together. \n\nThe author argues that gaming isn't a plan, just something he does to relax, and that she doesn't need to go out every time. He even tells her to relax or use his laptop. The girlfriend, however, feels left out and wants quality time. The author's main point is that he's fine with spending time together but also wants his own time to game.\n\nSo, where's the fault here? The author might be in the right because he's asserting his need for personal time, which is reasonable. However, maybe he's not considering her feelings adequately. The girlfriend might feel neglected if gaming becomes a regular activity that he does without her. The author's response of telling her to \"chill\" or use the laptop might not be addressing her emotional needs. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend is expecting him to always include her when he's gaming, that might be unrealistic. Gaming is a personal activity, and expecting her to plan something each time could be a stretch. The author is trying to balance his own needs with hers. \n\nOn the other hand, communication is key. If the author didn't discuss this balance properly, maybe he's not considering her feelings. But the problem seems to be mutual. The girlfriend might not be respecting his need for solo time. The author's actions are within his rights to take time for himself, so maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer could be B for No. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, based on the given info, the author is defending his right to have personal time, which is valid. So the answer is B.\n"
