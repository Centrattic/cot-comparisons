We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about the author and his girlfriend living together. The main issue is that the author wants to play games with friends, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels she needs to make plans every time he wants to game.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that when they first got together, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates and couple activities. Now that they live together, he's trying to reclaim some time for gaming. The girlfriend is upset because when he plays, she feels left out and has to make her own plans, which he's suggesting isn't necessary. She wants to be engaged or have her own activities when he's gaming, but when he's playing, she goes to her sister's house, which seems like she's seeking attention or maybe feeling neglected.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's not making a plan to game, just taking time to play, and the girlfriend is overreacting by needing to make plans each time. He says she wants constant attention, which is fine, but he also wants time to himself. The girlfriend's reaction is that it's unfair for him to play games without considering her, leading to arguments. The author told her she doesn't need to go out, just relax on her phone or use his laptop, which might not be satisfying for her.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel valued and respected. The author's girlfriend might feel that her needs for attention and connection aren't being met when he plays games. The author, on the other hand, is asserting his need for personal time and hobbies. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. The problem arises when one partner's needs are being ignored. The author's response to his girlfriend's complaints might be dismissive, as he's telling her she doesn't need to go out, which could make her feel like her feelings aren't important. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house could be a way to cope with feeling left out, but maybe not the most effective communication method. However, the author's initial response to her complaints might be part of the issue. By not acknowledging her feelings and instead telling her to relax on her phone, he's not addressing the root of her distress, which is the lack of engagement or connection during his gaming time. \n\nIt's possible that both partners have valid needs here. The author needs time for his hobby, and the girlfriend needs attention and maybe a sense of inclusion. The problem is how they're handling it. The author's approach might come off as dismissive, leading her to feel unimportant. The fact that she mentioned missing him and wanted to make plans suggests she feels neglected. The author's refusal to see that his gaming time affects her emotionally could mean he's not considering her feelings adequately. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is expecting the author to stop gaming whenever she doesn't have plans, that could also be unreasonable. There's a balance needed here. The author isn't wrong for wanting personal time, but if he's not communicating effectively or considering her emotional needs, that's where the issue lies. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be partially at fault for not addressing his girlfriend's feelings properly instead of dismissing them. His response that she can just relax on her phone might not be fulfilling her need for interaction or connection. The key is that relationships require compromise, and if one partner's needs are being consistently ignored, that's a problem. The author's approach to the situation could be seen as not being as considerate as it should be, hence he might be in the wrong.\n"
