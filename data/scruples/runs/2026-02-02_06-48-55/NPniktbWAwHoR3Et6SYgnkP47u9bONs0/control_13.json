We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy and his girlfriend who live together. He wants to play games with his friends, but she wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. He's saying she doesn't need to go out every time he's gaming, but she's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that when they first got together, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates and couple activities. Now that they live together, he's trying to reclaim some personal time for gaming. On the other hand, his girlfriend is feeling left out when he plays games, which she previously didn't mind when they were apart. She wants to spend time with friends or do her own thing when he's gaming, but he thinks it's not necessary for her to make plans every time.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author tried to explain that she could just chill or use his laptop, but she felt ignored. The girlfriend might feel that her needs for attention are being neglected, especially since they're living together now and her social time might be limited. The author, on the other hand, is trying to maintain his hobbies and social interactions with friends. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not accommodating her desire to make plans every time he plays. It seems like a balancing act. Both need to find a middle ground. The author isn't entirely wrong because everyone needs some personal time. However, maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. The girlfriend might need reassurance that her needs are being heard. \n\nIf the author is dismissive of her need for social time, that could be a problem. But if he's making it clear that he's available for her later and that she doesn't have to go out, maybe that's okay. The issue might be that the girlfriend expects more from him, like planning together time. \n\nIn this case, it's a situational thing. The author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his need for personal time, but there's room for better communication and compromise. So the answer would be B (No), but with the understanding that both sides need to work on their communication.\n"
