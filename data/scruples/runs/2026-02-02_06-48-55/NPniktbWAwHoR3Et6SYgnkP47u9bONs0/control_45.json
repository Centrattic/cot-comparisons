We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves the author and their girlfriend living together. The author wants to play games with friends, but the girlfriend gets upset because she feels left out when he does so. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is upset when he plays games without her. She wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans, but when he tells her she doesn't have to go out, she still gets upset. The author is trying to balance his gaming time with her need for attention. He mentions that he's okay with giving her attention but also wants to play games with friends.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, communication is crucial. The author initially thought she was joking when she said she missed him, but she was serious. He tried to suggest alternatives like talking while he plays, but she didn't want that. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house for hours might indicate she feels neglected. The author's frustration comes from feeling that he should be able to play games without her feeling the need to make plans.\n\nThe main issue here is the mismatch in expectations. The author might not realize that his girlfriend expects more active inclusion in his leisure activities now that they live together. When they were apart, she had her own space, but now living together, she might feel that his gaming time is taking up their shared time. The author's response of telling her she can just relax on her phone might not address her emotional need for companionship.\n\nHowever, the author isn't wrong in wanting to maintain his own hobbies. The problem is the lack of mutual understanding and communication. The girlfriend's reaction could be seen as an attempt to communicate her needs, but her approach might be causing conflict. The author's solution of not requiring her to make plans isn't inherently wrong, but it doesn't address the underlying issue of her feeling left out.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to compromise. The author might need to find a balance between his gaming time and her need for engagement. Maybe setting specific times for gaming and other times for couple activities could work. The author's stance isn't entirely wrong because he's asserting his need for personal time, but he could be more empathetic to her feelings. The girlfriend's approach could also be improved by expressing her needs without making plans she's not comfortable with.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal to require her to make plans is wrong. Since the girlfriend's main issue is feeling isolated, the author's response might not be the root cause, but the conflict arises from unmet expectations rather than the act of gaming itself. Therefore, it's a communication issue rather than a clear right or wrong. But given the options, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong (B), but both could benefit from better communication.\n"
