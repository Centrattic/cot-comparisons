We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. They've been together three years, and he's been giving up his time for their relationship. Now that they live together, he wants to game sometimes, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do when he's gaming.\n\nFirst, the author says he told her he was going to play games and asked if she minded. She responded by saying it's not fair because she has nothing to do. He thought maybe she was joking when he suggested she watch him play, but she wasn't. She wants him to preplan his gaming so she can make plans to go out. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time, that she can just relax or use his laptop. \n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend is feeling neglected when he's gaming. The author is trying to balance his need to have downtime with his friends and his relationship. \n\nThe author did try to communicate, but maybe not effectively. When she expressed her feelings, he might have dismissed them as a joke initially. Then he kept telling her she doesn't need to make plans, which she was upset about. She wanted him to plan ahead so she could make her own plans. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't have to go out, which might not address her need for time to herself or her feeling of being left out. \n\nBut also, the author mentions she's the type who wants constant attention. Maybe she's not used to him having his own interests. But it's important for both partners to have their own space. The author isn't doing anything wrong by wanting to play games, but he might not be considering her feelings enough. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might be her coping mechanism, but the author could have handled the situation better by being more understanding and finding a compromise. Maybe setting a time limit for gaming or having a designated time when they can just be together. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. He's not entirely wrong for wanting to play games, but he might not have been considerate enough of his girlfriend's feelings. He could have listened more and found a solution that works for both. So maybe the answer is A, yes, he's in the wrong because he dismissed her feelings and didn't find a compromise.\n"
