We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author wanting to game with friends and their girlfriend wanting plans made so she can go out. The author told her she doesn't need to go out every time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel neglected if he's gaming and she's just sitting there. But the author is also trying to maintain his hobbies and social life. \n\nWhen they lived separately, he had his own time to game. Now that they live together, the dynamics have changed. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from feeling like her needs aren't being considered. But the author is asserting that he doesn't need to plan around her every time he wants to game. \n\nThe key points here: communication issues, expectations after moving in together, and balancing personal time. The author didn't plan ahead, and the girlfriend felt left out. However, the author is also trying to maintain his interests. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance both partners' needs. The author's response of saying she doesn't need to go out every time might be valid if they can find a middle ground. But maybe the author should have communicated better from the start, considering the change in living situation. \n\nBut the girlfriend's approach of going to her sister's house each time might not be the healthiest solution either. It's a mutual adjustment period. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to game, but maybe he could have been more considerate of her feelings. However, he's also not in the wrong for stating his needs. It's a situational conflict where both need to communicate better. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's asserting his right to game without forcing her to plan each time, and she's reacting to that, it's more about differing expectations. The author isn't wrong per se, but maybe should have considered her feelings more. But given the options, B is more likely correct.\n"
