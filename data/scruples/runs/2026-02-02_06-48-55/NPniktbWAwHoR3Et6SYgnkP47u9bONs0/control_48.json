We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple living together, and the guy wants to game with his friends, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels she has to make plans to do something else while he's gaming. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, just to relax or use her phone.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The couple has been together for 3 years and have been living together for 4 months. The author used to spend his alone time gaming, but now that they live together, the girlfriend is expecting him to plan their time so she can have her own activities. The key issue seems to be communication and expectations about personal space versus couple time.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was that she felt it wasn't fair for him to game without her having something to do. She wanted to make plans when he was busy. The author tried to suggest she watch him play or use her phone, but she went to her sister's house, leading to arguments. The author points out that she often blamed him even when she didn't make plans and that he's fine with giving her attention but also wants his own time.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, mutual respect for each other's needs is crucial. The girlfriend might feel neglected if her partner is absorbed in gaming without considering her. However, the author is also entitled to his own hobbies and downtime. The problem arises when these activities interfere with the other person's needs without communication.\n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to go out every time, which might dismiss her feelings. He didn't consider her need for engagement or alternative activities. While he's not wrong for wanting personal time, not acknowledging her feelings of loneliness or lack of attention could be the issue. The girlfriend's expectation that he plans his gaming so she can have her own time might be reasonable if they communicate their needs better. However, the author's refusal to plan might not be entirely his fault if they hadn't established clear boundaries.\n\nIn many such cases, the root problem is a lack of communication rather than one person being wrong. The author might not be in the wrong if both parties are trying to communicate their needs but haven't found a middle ground. However, if his actions are making her feel ignored or unimportant, then maybe he's not being considerate enough. The fact that he jokes about her watching him play and then gets defensive when she's upset might not help. A healthy relationship requires compromise. If the author is being dismissive of her feelings, that's where he could be wrong. But if he's just asserting his need for personal time, he might not be entirely at fault. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because both have valid needs and the issue is more about communication than clear wrongdoing.\n"
