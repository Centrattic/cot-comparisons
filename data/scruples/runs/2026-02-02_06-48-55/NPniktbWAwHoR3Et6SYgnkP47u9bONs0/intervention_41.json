We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. The situation is that they live together, have been together three years. The girlfriend wants to plan her time when he's gaming, but the author thinks she doesn't need to go out every time.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author mentions that when they first got together, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates. Now that they live together, she's upset when he plays games without her. She wants to make plans so she has something to do, but he's telling her she doesn't have to go out. He even jokes that she can watch him play, but she's not interested and leaves. The argument happens multiple times, and he's frustrated because she blames him when she doesn't make plans.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong here. Even though he wants to play games with friends, relationships require consideration of each other's needs. The girlfriend is expressing that she feels neglected when he's gaming and wants some alone time or plans. The author's response of \"just relax on your phone\" might not be addressing her emotional needs. Communication is key, and maybe the author isn't acknowledging her feelings. It's not just about the time he spends gaming but how that affects her. If she's feeling lonely or left out, he should find a balance that works for both. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
