We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, but she's upset because she feels neglected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that they live together and have been together for three years. He used to play games alone when they were not living together, but now he plays while she's around. The girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do when he's gaming. The author tried to suggest she watch him play or use her phone, but she prefers to go out on her own. He tells her she doesn't need to make plans every time, but she's still upset.\n\nI think the key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author's girlfriend might feel that her needs aren't being considered. Even if the author is giving her options (like watching him play), she might prefer independence and feels that when he games, she has to entertain herself, which she isn't comfortable with. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to go out every time might be dismissive of her feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that she goes to her sister's house for hours when he plays could indicate that she's seeking some space, but the author sees it as a reaction to him gaming. The author might not be considering that she might need time away, not necessarily to go out, but maybe to have her own space. However, the author is also within his rights to want some personal time gaming with friends.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether he's being inconsiderate. By dismissing her need to make plans as unnecessary, he might be invalidating her feelings. She wants to have her own activities when he's busy, which is a reasonable request. The author's response that she can just relax on her phone might not address her deeper need for engagement or independence. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't doing anything wrong per se, like being abusive or neglectful. It's more about differing needs in a relationship. The problem arises when the author doesn't acknowledge her feelings and insists that she doesn't need to plan anything, which could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the author is partly at fault for not addressing her emotional needs adequately, even if they have different preferences.\n"
