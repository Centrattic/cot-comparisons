We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together, have been together three years, and the girlfriend is upset because when he plays games, she feels she has nothing to do. The author tried to tell her she can just relax or use his laptop, but she wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans.\n\nHmm, first, communication is key in relationships. The author mentions that when he told her he was going to play Apex Legends, she reacted negatively. He thought she was kidding when she said she had nothing to do, but she was serious. He tried to suggest she watch him play or use her phone, but she wants him to pre-plan so she can make her own plans. \n\nNow, the author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays. But the girlfriend's issue seems to be about feeling neglected or not having her own time when he's gaming. The problem arises because their expectations don't align. The author might not realize that even though he's at home, his gaming is taking up shared space, and she feels like she's left alone without plans. \n\nThe author says he gave up free time for dates when they first started dating, but now that they live together, maybe there's a shift in their dynamics. She might feel that since they live together, his gaming time is taking away from the time they spend together or her personal time. By telling her she doesn't need to make plans, he's dismissing her need for her own activities, which could be a valid request. \n\nThe girlfriend's request is that if he's going to be busy with gaming, he should plan ahead so she can make her own plans. The author's response is that she doesn't have to go out, just relax. But maybe she feels that if he's going to be occupied, she needs to have her own time, and not just sit around waiting. The author's solution of \"relax and chill\" might not address her emotional need for independent activities. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not wrong in wanting to game with friends, but he might be in the wrong for not acknowledging her feelings and needs. By not pre-planning or considering her need to have her own time, he's not being considerate. The key is mutual respect and finding a balance. The author's dismissive attitude towards her request could be the issue here. Therefore, the answer might be A, yes, he's in the wrong because he's not considering her perspective adequately.\n"
