We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans, but he's telling her she doesn't need to go out every time he plays.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that they've been together for 3 years and living together for 4 months. They used to have separate time where he would game, but now that they live together, the girlfriend feels that when he plays, she has nothing to do. She wants him to plan his gaming so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't have to leave every time and can just relax on her phone or use the laptop. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When they first got together, he gave up some free time for dates, but now with living together, there's a shift in dynamics. The girlfriend's issue is that when he's gaming, she wants to have something to do, which she interprets as needing to make plans. The author thinks she's overreacting and that she can just relax.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a relationship perspective, it's important for both partners to feel valued and heard. The author's initial approach was to let her know when he wants to play, but she's not satisfied and feels neglected. The author might not see his gaming as a problem, but his partner's feelings are valid. \n\nThe author's response when she expressed her feelings was dismissive. Saying she can just relax on her phone might not address her need for personal time or activities. The girlfriend might feel that her needs are being ignored, especially if she's used to having his attention. The author's argument that he's not going anywhere and they can talk while he plays might not be enough for her. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to meet in the middle. The author could be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging her feelings and not compromising. However, he's also expressing his need to have personal time with friends. The issue is communication and finding a balance. \n\nThe author's girlfriend might need more attention, and the author's gaming time is a point of tension. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't have to make plans, but maybe he should have discussed it more to find a solution that works for both. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be partially at fault for not fully addressing her feelings and not finding a compromise. However, it's also about mutual understanding. The answer depends on whether the author's actions are dismissive of his partner's valid concerns. \n\nIn this case, since the girlfriend is expressing her needs and the author is not meeting them halfway, the author could be in the wrong. But it's not entirely his fault either. However, based on the scenario, the answer is likely A (Yes) because he's not adequately considering her perspective and needs.\n"
