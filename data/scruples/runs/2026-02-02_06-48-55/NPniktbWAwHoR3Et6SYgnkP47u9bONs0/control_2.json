We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple living together for four months, three years into their relationship. The main issue is that the person (the author) wants to play video games, and their girlfriend is upset because she feels neglected when they do that. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not making plans every time they want to game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together a long time and the author used to spend a lot of time on dates but now they live together. The author plays games with friends, and the girlfriend is reacting by feeling left out. The author tried to explain that it's just a game and she could watch or do her own thing, but the girlfriend wants plans made in advance so she can go out. The author then tells her she doesn't need to go out every time, just chill on her phone or use the laptop. The girlfriend is described as wanting constant attention, but the author also wants to play games.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and expectations. The girlfriend is feeling that she's being neglected when the author plays games without making plans. The author sees gaming as their downtime and doesn't want to be restricted. The problem seems to be that the girlfriend is expecting the author to plan ahead so she can have her own time, but the author is resisting that, thinking it's unnecessary.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when partners have different needs, it's important to find a balance. The author's need for gaming time with friends is valid, but the girlfriend's need for attention and connection is also valid. The issue might be that the author isn't considering how the girlfriend feels, even if they don't see it as a big deal. The girlfriend is reacting emotionally because she feels neglected, and the author might be dismissing her feelings by suggesting she can just do her own thing. That could be where the problem lies.\n\nThe author's response of telling the girlfriend she doesn't have to make plans every time might be seen as not addressing her emotional needs. The girlfriend might feel that her desire for shared time or her feelings of loneliness aren't being respected. The author is in a position where they need to communicate and find a middle ground, maybe setting aside specific times for gaming and other times for couple activities. However, the author is arguing that the girlfriend is overreacting, which might not be the case. The girlfriend's reaction is a valid emotional response, so the author's dismissiveness could be the issue here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also expressing their own need for personal time, which is important in a relationship. So, it's a balance. The question is whether the author is wrong for not accommodating the girlfriend's request to plan ahead. If the author is not making an effort to include the girlfriend or to communicate their needs in a way that considers hers, then maybe they are in the wrong. However, if the author is being reasonable and the girlfriend is being overly demanding, then perhaps not.\n\nBut in this scenario, the girlfriend is clearly upset, and the author is not making an effort to adjust. The author's suggestion that the girlfriend can just relax on her phone or use the laptop might not be sufficient for the girlfriend's emotional needs. The girlfriend might want actual interaction or quality time, not just being in the same space. The author's refusal to plan ahead and the dismissive attitude could be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's feelings, making the author at least partially in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they are not sufficiently addressing their girlfriend's emotional needs and are dismissing her valid feelings of neglect. However, it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid needs, but the way the author is handling it is problematic.\n"
