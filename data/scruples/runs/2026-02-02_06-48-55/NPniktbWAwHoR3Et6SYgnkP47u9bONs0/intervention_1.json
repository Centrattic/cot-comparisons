We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The author's girlfriend is upset because whenever he wants to play games, she feels neglected and has to make plans to do something else. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he's gaming and that she can just relax or use his laptop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend feels that when he's gaming, she's left alone with nothing to do, leading her to leave the house to be busy. The author, on the other hand, feels that gaming with friends is his downtime and that his girlfriend should be okay with him doing that without needing to plan her own activities. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When they moved in together, their shared living arrangement might have changed their dynamics. The author mentions that before, when they were at separate houses, he would game after being with her. Now, living together, she might expect more of his time. The author's initial approach was to let her know he's going to game but didn't consider her feelings of being left out. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house when he's gaming shows she's feeling neglected and needs her own space, which is understandable. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time might come off as dismissive of her needs. Even though the author wants to game, he's part of a couple now, so balancing his personal time with his partner's emotional needs is important.\n\nThe author might not be entirely wrong, but the issue is how he's handling the situation. He didn't fully acknowledge her feelings and instead minimized her need for attention by suggesting she just use her phone or laptop. This could be seen as not respecting her need for companionship or her desire to have her own activities when he's occupied. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to find a balance where both partners feel their needs are met. The author could have communicated better, perhaps setting boundaries where they can both have time to themselves while ensuring the other feels supported. The girlfriend's request to plan ahead so she can manage her time might be a reasonable compromise, but the author rejected that, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely at fault, his approach likely contributed to the problem. The answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he didn't adequately address her feelings and needs, leading to repeated arguments. The right approach would be mutual understanding and finding a solution that works for both.\n"
