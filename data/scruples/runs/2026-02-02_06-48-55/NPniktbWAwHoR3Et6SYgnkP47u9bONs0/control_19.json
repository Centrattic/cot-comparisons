We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living together, and the guy wants to play games, but his girlfriend is upset if he doesn't plan it in advance so she can make plans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy says they've been together three years and he gave up a lot of his free time before. Now that they live together, he wants to play games with his friends. The girlfriend feels neglected and wants him to plan ahead so she can have her own time. The guy argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he plays; she can relax or use her phone.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The girlfriend's issue seems to be about feeling left out or not prioritized. The guy's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, but maybe that dismisses her feelings. When they first started, he gave up his time, but now it's different. Maybe the expectations have changed. The girlfriend wants some independence, but the guy sees it as unnecessary. \n\nIs the guy in the wrong? It depends on whether his actions are respectful of her needs. If he's being selfish and not considering her feelings, then yes. But if he's expressing his need to have personal time, and she's overreacting, maybe not. However, the fact that she went to her sister's house because he was gaming might indicate she felt neglected. The guy's response of telling her to just relax or use her phone might not be validating her feelings. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should feel heard. If the girlfriend is expressing that she misses him and wants planned time, the guy should acknowledge that, not just dismiss it. Maybe the issue is that he's not meeting her emotional needs. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering her feelings enough.\n"
