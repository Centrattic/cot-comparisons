We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting to make plans every time he wants to game, and the author telling her she doesn't need to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is upset because when the author plays games, she feels left out and has nothing to do. She wants to make plans to go out so she can have something to do. The author, on the other hand, wants to play games with friends online and doesn't see why she has to go out. He even suggests she can relax on her phone or use the laptop.\n\nThe author mentions that they live together now, so their time together is more intertwined. The girlfriend's reaction started after the author played Apex Legends with a friend. The author thought it was a joke when she mentioned watching him play, but she was serious. He then tried to accommodate by giving her advanced notice, but when she didn't make plans, she blamed him. The author feels that she wants constant attention, and he wants to have his own time.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. The author might be in the wrong if he hasn't considered his girlfriend's feelings. Just because he wants to game doesn't mean his partner should have to have plans. It's important in a relationship to be considerate of each other's needs. The girlfriend is expressing that she feels neglected when he plays games. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to leave is dismissive of her feelings. Maybe he should have discussed her feelings more and found a compromise, like setting specific times for gaming and other times for together activities, rather than expecting her to make plans every time.\n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend might need to communicate her needs better. If she's feeling lonely when he's gaming, maybe she can suggest activities they can do together instead of going out. But the author's approach of not considering her feelings and dismissing her as wanting \"constant attention\" might not be fair.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to balance their individual needs with the relationship's needs. The author might be prioritizing his own time without considering how it affects his girlfriend. So, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't adequately address her feelings and instead told her she didn't need to make plans, which could be seen as invalidating her need for attention and activities when he's occupied.\n"
