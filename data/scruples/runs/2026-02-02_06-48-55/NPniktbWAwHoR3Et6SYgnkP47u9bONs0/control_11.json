We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who wants the author to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays games.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they've been together for three years and live together now. He used to give up his free time for dates when they first started, but now he wants to game. The girlfriend seems to feel neglected when he plays, as she has nothing else to do and wants to make plans when he's busy. The author, however, thinks she should just relax or use her phone when he's gaming.\n\nLooking at the dynamics, the girlfriend might be feeling that her needs aren't being considered. She wants quality time together and is upset when he plays without involving her. The author, on the other hand, is trying to balance his personal time with their relationship. He's okay with her wanting attention but also wants his own space to play with friends.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. When they live together, personal space and shared time become more complex. The author didn't see gaming as a \"plan,\" but the girlfriend did, leading to conflict. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, but maybe he should have discussed how they both can have their needs met.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her request is reasonable to have her own time when he's occupied. However, the author might not realize that his gaming sessions are seen as taking up shared time. The problem arises when the girlfriend feels she has to go out every time, leading to blame when she can't. The author's suggestion to just relax on her phone might not satisfy her need for social interaction or activities.\n\nIt's important to note that both have valid points. The author is trying to maintain his interests, and the girlfriend wants to manage her time independently. The issue is about finding a balance. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings and the transition to living together requires adjusting expectations. However, he's also not entirely at fault because he's trying to communicate his needs as well.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author could have approached the situation by discussing how they can both have their needs met, perhaps setting times for gaming and times for couple activities. Since he's not giving her a choice to relax and instead is dismissive of her need to plan, maybe he's not fully addressing her feelings. On the other hand, if she's expecting him to plan every gaming session so she can go out, that might be unrealistic if he wants spontaneous play with friends.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because he's asserting his need for personal time, but there's room for better communication. However, if the girlfriend's needs are being consistently ignored, then maybe the author is partially at fault. But given the scenario, the main conflict is about expectations, and the author's response is a valid point that she doesn't have to go out every time. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
