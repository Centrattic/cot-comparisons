We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They've been together for three years and live together now. The main issue seems to be that the girlfriend feels neglected when he plays games and expects her to have plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out just because he's gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that he's trying to balance his gaming time with his relationship. He's given up a lot of free time for their relationship before, but now that they live together, he wants to game with friends. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels she gets no time to herself and expects him to involve her in plans, leading to arguments when she can't make them happen.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend feels her needs aren't being met when he's gaming, which is a valid feeling. She wants quality time together, and when he's gaming, she might feel excluded. The author, however, is trying to maintain his own interests and social life, which is also important for a healthy relationship. The problem arises when one person's needs overshadow the other's without considering compromise.\n\nThe author's response to the situation\u2014telling her she doesn't need to make plans and can just relax on her phone\u2014might come off as dismissive of her feelings. Even if he's not going anywhere, she might need more than just passive presence. The girlfriend's reaction of leaving to her sister's house indicates she's hurt or frustrated, which the author didn't address adequately. Instead of explaining his need to game, he should have discussed finding a middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming and other times for couple activities.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel valued. The author's insistence on gaming without considering his girlfriend's emotional needs could lead to resentment. His justification that she can just watch him play might not account for her desire for active engagement. The fact that the girlfriend felt the need to make plans each time suggests she wants to ensure she has her own space or time, which the author dismissed by saying she doesn't need to go out. This could be seen as not respecting her emotional boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to his own hobbies and social interactions. The issue is how he communicated this. Instead of a confrontational approach, a more collaborative discussion about balancing both their needs would be better. The author might not be entirely wrong, but his handling of the situation shows a lack of consideration for his girlfriend's feelings, which is a problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he didn't address his girlfriend's feelings adequately and didn't seek a balanced solution. The answer should be A.\n"
