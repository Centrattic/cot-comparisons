We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author and his girlfriend living together. They've been together for three years and he's loved every minute. But now that they live together, there's some conflict when he wants to game.\n\nThe key points from the story: The author used to give up a lot of his free time for dates when they were separate. Now that they live together, he wants to play games with friends, but the girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do while he's gaming. She wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax on her phone or use the laptop. The girlfriend is described as someone who wants constant attention, but the author also wants time to play games with friends.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend is feeling neglected when he plays games. She's saying it's not fair that he plays games without her having things to do. The author is trying to explain that it's just gaming, and she can do her own thing. But the girlfriend is reacting strongly, going to her sister's house for a few hours. The author then tells her she doesn't need to make plans every time he plays, which is the AITA question.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author did try to tell her he was going to play, but she felt it wasn't a plan and wanted him to plan ahead. The author's response was that she doesn't need to go out, just relax. But the girlfriend seems to want more structured time when he's playing. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The author might be missing that she wants quality time together when he's not gaming, but when he is, she wants her own space. However, he's trying to balance his own wants (gaming) with her needs (attention and plans). \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, he did try to communicate, but maybe not effectively. He might be dismissing her feelings. The girlfriend feels that when he's gaming, she's left out and needs to have her own plans. The author's response that she can just relax on her phone might not address her emotional needs. She might feel lonely when he's gaming, so she seeks her own plans to not be bored. If the author is insistent on playing without considering her need for plans, that could be the issue. On the flip side, the author is within his rights to want his own hobbies. However, since they live together, mutual respect and compromise are important. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be a bit extreme, but her feelings are valid. The author's argument that she doesn't need to go out every time is valid too, but he might not be acknowledging her emotional needs. The key is whether he's in the wrong for not accommodating her need for plans. If he's not willing to plan ahead so she can have her own time, that could be the issue. But since he's also trying to balance his own time, it's a bit of a two-way street. \n\nIn the end, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's asserting his right to have personal time. But he could be more considerate. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to game and she's upset, but he's not making her go out, just not requiring her to make plans\u2014maybe he's not wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. Another angle: if she's feeling left out, maybe the author should plan ahead so she can have her own time. But he's saying she doesn't need to plan, just chill. If she's not happy with that, maybe the author should find a middle ground. But according to the scenario, he's not forcing her to do anything\u2014just allowing her to have her own space. So he's not wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
