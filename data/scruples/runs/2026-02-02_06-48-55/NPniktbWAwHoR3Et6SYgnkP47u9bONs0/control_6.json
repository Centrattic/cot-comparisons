We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a couple living together for four months, having been together three years. The guy wants to play games with friends, and his girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do during that time. He argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game, just relax or use her phone. She wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. The guy is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy is trying to maintain his own hobbies and social time, which is valid. However, living together means more shared time, so maybe some adjustment is needed. The girlfriend feels neglected when he's gaming, which is a common issue. She wants to have her own activities, which is also reasonable. The problem arises when the guy dismisses her feelings by saying she can just relax or use her phone. That might not be the best approach because it doesn't acknowledge her need for separate activities.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's frustration is about not feeling included or having her needs met. The guy's point is about his right to play games. The argument here is about balancing personal time and shared life. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel their needs are heard. If the girlfriend is upset, it's important for the guy to listen and find a compromise. Saying she doesn't need to make plans every time might be dismissive. Maybe they need to agree on a schedule or find times when he can game without her feeling left out. Alternatively, maybe she can have her own time while he plays, but he should validate her feelings instead of minimizing them.\n\nSo, is the guy in the wrong? He's not entirely, as he has a right to his interests. However, his response to her feelings might be part of the problem. Dismissing her by telling her to just relax could be hurtful. The issue is more about communication and finding a middle ground rather than one being entirely right or wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong) but with the caveat that both need to work on communication. The question is whether he's in the wrong, and based on the information, he's not necessarily wrong, but his approach could be improved. So the answer is B.\n"
