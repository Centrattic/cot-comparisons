We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who wants to make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nFirst, the background: They've been together three years, living together for four months. The author used to game when they were apart but now, since they live together, the girlfriend is upset when he plays games without her. She wants to make plans so she's not left with nothing to do. The author thinks she's overreacting and that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and expectations. When they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, so maybe there's an imbalance now. Living together changes dynamics; he might not realize how his gaming affects her. She's feeling neglected, which is a valid emotion. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, just chill on her phone. But maybe he's not acknowledging her need for social interaction or activities. She might feel that she's sacrificing her own plans to be with him, and now he's not considering her need for independence. \n\nAlso, the argument about pre-planning gaming time suggests she wants to manage her schedule around his. But he's not respecting that by not giving her proper notice. His friends' plans are impromptu, which might be causing her stress. \n\nHowever, he does mention he's trying to balance her needs with his own. He offers compromises like talking while he plays. But the girlfriend's reaction (going to her sister's) indicates she's not satisfied. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong entirely. He's trying to maintain his hobbies and autonomy. But he could be more considerate of her feelings and needs. The problem might be a lack of communication rather than one person being wrong. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend's needs are valid, then he might need to adjust. But if her expectations are unreasonable, maybe not. \n\nThe main issue is balancing personal time vs. couple time. Both should have space. The author's mistake might be not seeing her perspective and not finding a middle ground. So, perhaps he is in the wrong for not addressing her feelings properly. But the answer depends on whose perspective you take. The answer might be A (he's wrong) because he's dismissing her valid need for social activity and not considering her feelings when he plays without her. He should communicate better and find a way to include her or at least acknowledge her need for her own time.\n"
