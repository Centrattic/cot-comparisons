We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who live together. The author wants to play games with friends, but the girlfriend is upset because she feels left out when he's gaming. She wants him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, and he's fine with her just chilling on her phone or using the laptop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a right to his own hobbies and downtime, especially since they live together. Gaming is a common way people relax. However, the girlfriend is feeling neglected. Maybe she's not getting enough attention when he's gaming. The key point is communication and mutual respect in the relationship.\n\nThe author mentions that when they were dating before moving in, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates. Now that they live together, the balance might be shifting. The girlfriend might feel that since they're together 24/7, she needs her own time, but she's reacting to his gaming time by trying to plan her own activities. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't have to make plans and just relax. \n\nIs it fair for the girlfriend to expect him to plan his gaming so she can go out? Maybe not. It's a bit controlling if she's requiring him to schedule his time for her convenience. On the other hand, he should consider her feelings and ensure she's not feeling isolated. However, the author is trying to maintain his own space and activities, which is important for a healthy relationship. He's also offering alternatives like talking while he plays or her using the laptop. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house for hours might be extreme, especially since she's in the same house. It could indicate that she's not comfortable with conflict or that her needs aren't being communicated effectively. The author's point is valid that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. It's reasonable for him to have his own hobbies, and expecting her to leave the house every time he plays might be unrealistic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for wanting to play games. The relationship requires both parties to respect each other's interests. However, maybe the author could have been more proactive in finding a middle ground earlier, rather than waiting for arguments. But given the situation, the core issue is the girlfriend's expectations. The author is standing his ground, which is okay as long as he's not being dismissive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations, and they need better communication. The author isn't obligated to plan his gaming around her going out.\n"
