We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together, and when they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates. Now that they live together, he wants to game with his friends, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do while he's gaming. She wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. The author told her she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author mentions he gave her advanced notice sometimes, but she still ended up going to her sister's house. Maybe the problem is that the author didn't consider her feelings when he started gaming without explicitly planning around her. Even though he thought it wasn't a \"plan,\" maybe she felt ignored. He said she wants constant attention, which is fine, but he also wants his own space. It's a balance.\n\nBut wait, the author's main argument is that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays games. He suggests she can just relax on her phone or use his laptop. That seems reasonable. However, if she's expecting some quality time or feels neglected when he's gaming, maybe the author isn't considering her emotional needs. Gaming is a social activity for him, but for her, it might feel like he's pulling away without notice, leading to loneliness.\n\nAnother point: when they first started dating, he gave up his free time for her, but now that they live together, he's trying to reclaim some of that time. It's understandable, but transitions in relationships can be tricky. Maybe he didn't set boundaries early enough when they moved in together. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that her needs aren't being considered again, especially if she's used to having his attention.\n\nHowever, the author isn't wrong in wanting to game with friends. It's a common hobby, and it's okay to have personal time. But maybe he could have been more considerate in how he approaches it. Instead of dismissing her need to make plans, perhaps finding a middle ground where they both have time for their own activities and time together. The fact that she went to her sister's house multiple times suggests she feels unhappy with the situation, which the author might need to address more thoughtfully.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's not wrong for wanting to game and not requiring her to make plans. On the other hand, maybe he didn't communicate his intentions clearly or consider her feelings enough. The key might be that he didn't plan ahead to ensure both their needs were met. Since she wanted to make plans and he dismissed it, maybe he's not fully considering her perspective. But the answer might depend on cultural or personal relationship norms. \n\nIn the end, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because having personal hobbies is important. However, there's room for improvement in how he communicates and considers her feelings. Since the question asks if he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), because he's not wrong for wanting his own time, but he could be more considerate. But maybe some would argue A (Yes) because he didn't plan ahead. Hmm. The community might lean towards B since the girlfriend wants to make plans, but he's not forcing her to go out, just saying she doesn't have to. So B.\n"
