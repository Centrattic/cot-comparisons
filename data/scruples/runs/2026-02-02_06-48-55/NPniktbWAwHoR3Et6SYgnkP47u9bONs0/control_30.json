We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together, have been together three years. Initially, he gave up a lot of free time for dates, but now that they live together, he wants to game sometimes.\n\nSo, the problem started when he mentioned playing Apex with his buddy, and the girlfriend reacted by saying she has nothing else to do. He thought she was kidding but then she wanted him to plan ahead so she could make her own plans. He argued that she didn't have to go out, just chill on her phone or his laptop. She went to her sister's house, and he played. The argument repeated a couple of times. She wants him to plan his gaming so she can plan her time, but he doesn't see the need for her to go out every time.\n\nHmm. The key points are about expectations and communication. The girlfriend seems to want to use the time he's gaming for her own activities, possibly expecting him to be as engaged as before. The author might not realize that even if she's not going out, her feeling left out or having nothing to do could be valid. He's giving her options like watching or using the laptop, but she might prefer her own space or activities, which is reasonable. \n\nBut the author is also justified in wanting some personal time to game. However, the issue might be in how he handles her feelings. Telling her she doesn't need to make plans could dismiss her need for independent activities, which is important for a healthy relationship. Maybe both need to compromise. The girlfriend might feel neglected, while the author wants his space. \n\nIs the author wrong? Possibly. He's not considering her feelings of being excluded. Even if she's at home, she might feel that his focus is on gaming, not on her. The fact that she went to her sister's house shows she wanted separate time, but maybe the author's response was dismissive. He should communicate better and find a balance between his gaming and her needs. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement. But according to AITA standards, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author isn't addressing that, he might be in the wrong. The answer could be A or B. Hmm. I think it's a B because both have valid points, but the author is not entirely wrong. Wait, but the girlfriend's reaction is about her needing her own time, which is reasonable. The author's dismissal of her need to plan might be the issue. So maybe A. But I'm not sure. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not making her go out but suggesting she can do something else, but she wants separate plans. Maybe he's not in the wrong because he's respecting her choice to do something else, but the problem is the expectation that she must make plans. The answer is B because he's not wrong for saying she doesn't have to make plans every time he plays. It's about mutual respect and communication. He's not forcing her to do anything, just clarifying that she doesn't have to plan. So B.\n"
