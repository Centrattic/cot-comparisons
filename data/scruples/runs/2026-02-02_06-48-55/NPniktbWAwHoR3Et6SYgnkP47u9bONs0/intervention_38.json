We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend wanting the author to plan gaming time so she can make her own plans, and the author telling her she doesn't need to go out every time he plays. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The couple has been together three years and lives together now. The author used to give up his game time for dates, but now with living together, he wants to play games with friends. The girlfriend is upset that he plays without planning ahead, so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax or use his laptop. They argue about it multiple times.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations in the relationship. The girlfriend feels neglected when he's gaming, so she wants to have her own time by making plans. The author, on the other hand, sees gaming as a personal activity and doesn't think she needs to leave the house for it. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel that the author isn't considering her feelings. When they were not living together, he had his time, but now that they live together, she's expecting more shared time or at least consideration for her own activities. The author, however, is trying to maintain his hobby and social connections. \n\nThe problem arises because the author didn't plan ahead, leading to her feeling left out. He says he's not going anywhere and offers alternatives like watching or talking, but she prefers to go out. The author's response of telling her not to make plans every time might come off as dismissive, as he's not acknowledging her need for personal time. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance both partners' needs. If the girlfriend feels that her needs for attention and personal space are being ignored, then the author might be in the wrong by not accommodating her. Even if he's okay with her wanting attention, he should communicate better and find a middle ground. Telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time could be seen as not respecting her feelings. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting because the author is still present and willing to interact. But the fact that she leaves to her sister's house multiple times suggests she's not getting what she needs. The author could have been more proactive in discussing their expectations when they moved in together, rather than expecting her to adjust without prior planning. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong by not anticipating the change in dynamics when they started living together and not making an effort to meet her halfway. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
