We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple living together, and the author (the man) is gaming while his girlfriend feels neglected and wants him to make plans every time he wants to play.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. They've been together for three years and have been living together for four months. The man used to give up his free time for dates but now, since they live together, he's trying to game. His girlfriend is upset because when he plays, she has nothing to do. He mentions that she wants him to plan in advance so she can make other plans. He argues that she doesn't need to leave every time; she can just relax. The girlfriend went to her sister's house a few times, and the man proceeds to play games. The man says she's the type who wants constant attention, but he also wants to game with friends.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The man is trying to balance his personal time with his partner's needs. The girlfriend feels neglected because when he's gaming, she's left without anything to do. She's asking for plans in advance so she can have her own time or activities. The man's response is that she doesn't need to go out, just relax. But perhaps the issue is that he's not considering her need for attention and social interaction, which she might value highly.\n\nIn a relationship, communication is key. The man might be in his right to want some personal time, but if the girlfriend is feeling consistently neglected, that's a problem. The fact that she went to her sister's house multiple times suggests she's not just being dramatic but is actually trying to get space or is upset enough to leave. The man's argument that she can just relax and use her phone might not address her underlying need for companionship or structured time together. \n\nThe girlfriend's expectation that he should plan ahead so she can make her own plans could be a reasonable way to balance both their needs. The man's refusal to plan and his insistence that she doesn't need to go out might be dismissive of her feelings. Even if he's not going anywhere, maybe the quality time they spend together is important for her. \n\nHowever, it's also true that the man has a right to some personal time, especially when they're living together. The problem might be that the communication isn't effective. The man's approach of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time might be too dismissive, not acknowledging her feelings of neglect. \n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, it's often emphasized that both partners need to respect each other's needs. The man's gaming with friends is a legitimate hobby, but if it's causing repeated arguments and his partner is feeling left out, he might need to adjust. Perhaps a middle ground could be found where he can have some gaming time but also set aside time for them to be together or for her to have her own activities. \n\nThe man's response of telling her she can just relax and use her phone might not be sufficient if she genuinely needs more active engagement or if she's used to a certain level of attention. The fact that the arguments are recurring suggests that the current approach isn't working. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not adequately addressing his girlfriend's feelings of neglect and is dismissing her need for planned time together. While he has a right to personal time, the way he's handling the situation could be contributing to the conflict. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
