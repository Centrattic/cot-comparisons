We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's girlfriend wanting to plan activities when he plays games, while the author thinks she doesn't need to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that they've been together for three years and live together now. Initially, he gave up his free time for dates, but now he wants to play games. His girlfriend feels left out when he plays, expecting him to plan time with her or others so she doesn't feel alone. The author, on the other hand, thinks she should just relax or use her phone.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend wants attention and feels neglected when he's gaming. The author is trying to balance his personal time with her needs. The problem arises when the author dismisses her feelings by saying she doesn't need to make plans. Even if he's joking about her watching him play, she's clearly upset, and he's not addressing her emotional needs. \n\nThe author's argument that she can just chill on her phone might not consider that she wants active engagement. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house shows she's trying to cope by seeking support elsewhere. The author isn't acknowledging her feelings of missing him and wanting quality time. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should feel heard. The author might be inconsiderate by not validating her feelings. Even if gaming is his downtime, the girlfriend's need for connection is valid. The solution should involve compromise, like setting aside game-free time for them to spend together, rather than expecting her to make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nSo, the author is partially in the wrong because he's not addressing his girlfriend's emotional needs and isn't communicating effectively. Instead of dismissing her, he should find a middle ground where both can have their needs met.\n"
