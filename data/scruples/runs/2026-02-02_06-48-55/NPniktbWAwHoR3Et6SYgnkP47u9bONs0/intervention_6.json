We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their girlfriend arguing about gaming time. The key points are: they live together, the author plays games and the girlfriend feels left out, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that they previously gave up a lot of their time for the relationship, and now they want to game. They argue that the girlfriend doesn't need to make plans every time he plays, just relax. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels neglected when he's gaming and wants to have her own time or activities when he's busy.\n\nThe author's main point is that the girlfriend is overreacting because she's not obligated to make plans. He offers for her to watch him play or use his laptop. However, the girlfriend's response was to leave the house, which might indicate she felt ignored. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings of loneliness. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting personal time, but the way he handles the situation could be problematic. He dismisses her feelings by saying she can just relax on her phone, which might not address her emotional needs. The girlfriend's request for preplanning might stem from feeling excluded, so the author's refusal to accommodate that could be seen as not respecting her needs. \n\nBalancing personal time and partner's needs is tricky. The author's gaming is his free time, but the girlfriend might feel that time should be shared. It's important to find a middle ground where both can have their needs met. The author's approach of expecting her to just relax might not consider her desire for social interaction or activities. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be partially at fault for not addressing his girlfriend's feelings adequately. He didn't take her concerns seriously enough and dismissed her need for her own plans. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
