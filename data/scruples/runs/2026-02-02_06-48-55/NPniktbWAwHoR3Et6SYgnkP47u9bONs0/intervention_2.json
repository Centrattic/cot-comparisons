We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend are living together. The main issue is that when he wants to play games, she expects him to make plans so she can go out and be busy, but he doesn't think she needs to plan something every time he games.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The couple has been together for 3 years and living together for 4 months. The author gave up a lot of his free time for their relationship initially. Now, since they live together, she's upset when he plays games without her making plans to do something else. The author thinks she wants constant attention, but he also wants to game with friends. He told her she doesn't need to go out, just relax. The girlfriend went to her sister's house in one instance, leading to arguments.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The author's argument is that gaming isn't a plan, so she doesn't need to make one. But the girlfriend is feeling neglected or that her time isn't valued. Maybe she wants shared activities or feels left out when he's gaming. The author's response of \"just relax on your phone\" might not be fulfilling her need for connection. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author didn't consider her feelings when he dismissed her need to have her own plans. Even if he's not doing something that goes away, like going out, the act of gaming might make her feel ignored. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house shows she's hurt and seeking space, which the author didn't address properly.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned she \"has nothing else to do\" while he plays. That could be an underlying issue where she's not engaged in her own activities, leading to frustration. The author's solution of letting her watch or talk might not be what she wants. She might need to have her own time or activities that she can do independently when he's gaming.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel valued and not neglected. The author's dismissal of her need to plan something might be ignoring her emotional needs. He might not realize that his gaming time is causing her to feel left out, even if he's physically present. The fact that she goes to her sister's house indicates she's seeking support, which the author didn't address adequately. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't take her feelings into account and dismissed her need for her own plans. He could have communicated better to find a middle ground, like setting specific times for gaming and quality time together. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
