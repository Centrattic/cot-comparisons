We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author wants to play games online with friends, but the girlfriend expects him to make plans so she can go out and not be alone while he's gaming. The author argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he plays, and she's upset because he doesn't inform her in advance so she can have her own time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. They live together, so they're spending more time together. The girlfriend might feel that since they're in the same space, his gaming time is taking over their shared time. She wants to have her own activities when he's gaming, so she can have some independence. However, the author is pushing back, saying she doesn't need to go out every time and can just relax or use her phone.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author initially didn't consider that his gaming sessions might leave the girlfriend without anything to do. When she expressed this, he made a joke about her watching him play, which might have been dismissive. Then, when she wanted him to plan ahead, he resisted, leading to arguments. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners should have the right to their hobbies and free time, but they also need to respect each other's needs. The girlfriend's request for planning in advance is about maintaining her own space and activities. The author's refusal might be seen as not respecting her need for personal time. However, the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house every time might be overreacting, but that's not the author's fault directly.\n\nThe author's response that she doesn't need to make plans because he's not going anywhere and she can just chill might not address her underlying need for her own activities. It's possible he's underestimating how important it is for her to have that time. In a healthy relationship, both partners should make an effort to accommodate each other's needs without resentment. The author could be in the wrong if he's not making the effort to communicate and find a compromise, like setting specific gaming times where she knows she can have her own time, or finding activities they can do together. \n\nBut also, the girlfriend might need to find her own ways to occupy herself, and expecting the author to plan around her every time might be too much. However, the fact that she's the one who raised the issue and the author dismissed her initially points towards him not being fully considerate of her feelings. \n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't take her feelings seriously enough and didn't make a genuine effort to adjust his behavior to accommodate her needs. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
