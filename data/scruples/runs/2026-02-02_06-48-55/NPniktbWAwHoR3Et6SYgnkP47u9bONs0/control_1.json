We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together, have been together three years. The main issue is that when they first dated, he gave up his free time for her, but now that they live together, he wants to game with friends, and she expects him to plan so she can have her own time.\n\nSo, the author says he told her she doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming. She wanted to have her own activities when he was playing. The author argues that she can just relax or use his laptop. She goes to her sister's house if she's upset. He's defending that he's not going anywhere and wants to play games with friends.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling neglected or not included. When they first started dating, the dynamic was different\u2014he gave up his gaming time, but now that they live together, maybe she feels he's not considering her needs when he plays. However, the author is asserting his right to have his own downtime. \n\nThe problem arises when the girlfriend expects him to pre-plan so she can make her own plans. The author's response was that she doesn't need to go out; she can just relax. That might be where the disconnect is. She might feel that if he's going to spend time on something, she should have her own space or time. But maybe she's overreacting by making it a requirement for her to have plans every time he games. \n\nThe author's point is valid in that he's entitled to his hobbies, but he might not be acknowledging her need for personal time. However, the girlfriend's approach of making it a plan and then getting upset when she can't follow through might be the issue. The author's response to tell her she can just relax or use his laptop shows he's trying to accommodate her by allowing her to do her own thing. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his actions are respecting her feelings. He's asserting his boundaries, which is okay, but if his gaming is causing her to feel isolated, maybe he needs to adjust. However, in this case, the girlfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme. She's blaming him when she doesn't make her plans, which is unfair. The author is correct in pointing out that she doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
