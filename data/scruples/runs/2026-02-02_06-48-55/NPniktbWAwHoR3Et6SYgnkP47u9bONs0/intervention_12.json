We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to play video games while living with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he doesn't make plans for them every time he wants to game, and she feels left out. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out just because he plays, and that she can relax or use his laptop.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author and his girlfriend have been together for 3 years and live together now. He gave up a lot of his free time initially for their relationship. Now, he wants to play games with friends, which is a form of socializing for him. The girlfriend feels neglected because when he's gaming, she has nothing to do. She wants him to plan his gaming so she can make her own plans, maybe to spend time with her friends or have something to do. The author dismisses her feelings, suggesting she just relax or use his laptop, which might not address her emotional needs.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual consideration. The author might be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging his girlfriend's feelings of loneliness. Just because he's not physically leaving the house doesn't mean she doesn't need her own time. By not considering her need for separate activities or not communicating better, he might be causing her to feel ignored. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house several times could indicate she feels neglected, and the author's response of telling her she doesn't need to plan might be dismissive of her valid feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also trying to maintain his hobbies and social connections, which is important in a relationship. However, the way he's handling the situation might be contributing to the conflict. The fact that she's the type who wants constant attention suggests that their needs in this area might be conflicting. The author needs to find a balance where he can enjoy his games without making her feel left out, perhaps by setting aside dedicated time for both activities and each other. The author's approach of not planning and expecting her to just relax might not be meeting her emotional needs, which could be where he's at fault.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If the author is not willing to adjust his gaming schedule or include her in his activities (like watching together or having set times for games), it might be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's request for pre-planning seems like an effort to manage her time and expectations. The author's dismissal of her need to plan could be the root of the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not addressing her emotional needs and is being dismissive of her perspective.\n"
