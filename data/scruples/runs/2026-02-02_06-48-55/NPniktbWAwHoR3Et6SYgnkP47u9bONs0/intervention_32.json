We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation with his girlfriend. The situation is about him wanting to game and her feeling left out, wanting to have plans when he's busy.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they live together now. When they first dated, he gave up his free time for dates, but now that they live together, he wants to game. The girlfriend feels it's unfair because when he's gaming, she has nothing to do. He jokes about her watching him play, but she takes it seriously and says she needs to make plans when he's busy. She even goes to her sister's house. He argues that it's not a plan and they can talk while he plays, but she's not having it. Then she keeps blaming him when she doesn't make plans, and he tells her she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax. \n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he's gaming because they're living together now, so she's expecting more quality time. The author wants to maintain his gaming hobby, which is a valid interest. But maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. When he first started living together, maybe he should have balanced his gaming with her expectations. The fact that she's going to her sister's house could indicate she feels lonely when he's gaming. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans might not address her emotional need for company. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't forcing her to be busy; he's just gaming. The girlfriend might need to communicate her needs better or find her own activities. However, the author could have been more considerate in how he approaches gaming time, maybe setting a time limit or including her in his activities more. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. He might not be wrong in wanting to game, but he could have handled the situation more sensitively, acknowledging her feelings instead of dismissing them. The key is communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's reaction is valid if she feels neglected, but the author's right to his hobbies is also valid. The problem is the lack of compromise. So, the author is somewhat in the wrong for not addressing her feelings adequately, even if his actions aren't entirely at fault. The answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her emotional needs enough. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because it's about balancing personal time. \n\nBut the user thinks he's in the wrong. Considering the situation, the girlfriend is seeking attention and connection, which is normal. The author's dismissal of her need to make plans by saying she can just chill might not address her deeper need to not feel alone. Therefore, the author's approach was lacking empathy. So, the answer is A.\n"
