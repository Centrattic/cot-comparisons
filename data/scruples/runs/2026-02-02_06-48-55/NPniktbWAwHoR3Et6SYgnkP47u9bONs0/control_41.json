We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe situation is about the author and his girlfriend living together. He wants to play video games, but she's upset because she feels she has nothing to do when he's gaming. She wants him to plan so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays and that she can just relax or use her phone. He's saying she wants constant attention, but he also wants time to play with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he's gaming, especially since they live together. She might want to have her own time or activities, and if he doesn't plan ahead, she can't make her own plans. That could lead to her feeling left out or not considered. On the other hand, the author is trying to balance his personal time with their relationship. He's not going anywhere, and he's offering that they can spend time together after he's done gaming.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author did try to give notice, but she still felt it wasn't enough. He's asking her to just \"chill\" and not require plans, but she might need more structure. In relationships, it's important that both partners feel their needs are met. If one partner wants structured time and the other wants flexibility, there should be a compromise. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings enough. However, he's also entitled to his own hobbies. \n\nBut the problem arises when his gaming time is causing repeated arguments. If he's not making an effort to include her or ensure she has time to herself, that could be an issue. However, he's also not forcing her to do anything. The fact that she went to her sister's house when he was gaming shows she's taking the initiative to find her own time, but maybe the author should be more mindful of her need for plans. \n\nI think it's a balance. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because everyone needs personal time. But he might need to communicate better and find a middle ground. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the girlfriend's main issue is the need to plan around his gaming, the answer hinges on whether his refusal to require her to plan is unreasonable. In many relationships, partners expect to have their own time, but it's also about how it affects the other person. If his actions are making her feel ignored, then maybe he should adjust. But since he's not forcing her to do anything, maybe he's not in the wrong. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B, but I'm a bit conflicted. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and typical relationship norms. In some cases, the author might be seen as reasonable, while in others, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and he's not violating any explicit rules, maybe B is correct.\n"
