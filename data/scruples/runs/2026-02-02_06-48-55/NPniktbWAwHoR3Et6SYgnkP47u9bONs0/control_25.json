We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nSo, the author and their girlfriend have been together for three years and live together now. The key issue is that the author wants to play video games sometimes, and the girlfriend expects them to make plans so she can do something else, like go out. The author argues that the girlfriend doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming, suggesting she can relax or use the laptop. The girlfriend feels neglected, while the author wants to game with friends online.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend might feel that when they live together, her time is being taken up by his gaming, and she wants to have her own activities. The author, on the other hand, is trying to maintain a hobby and social interaction through gaming, which he had given up before they were together. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, communication and compromise are key. The author mentions that he thought the girlfriend was kidding when she said she wanted plans, and then she got upset. The author then tried to tell her she doesn't need to go out, just relax. However, the girlfriend might feel that her needs for attention and having her own time aren't being respected. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel valued and heard. If the girlfriend feels that her alone time is only possible when the author is gaming, that could be a problem. The author might not be considering how his gaming affects her feelings of connection. On the flip side, the author has a right to his hobbies and personal time. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is dismissing the girlfriend's valid need for personal time and attention. By saying she just needs to relax or use the laptop, he might be invalidating her feelings. The girlfriend's request to plan ahead so she can have her own time isn't unreasonable. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging her feelings and not making an effort to balance both their needs. However, it's also possible that the girlfriend is overreacting, expecting the author to change his habits. But generally, in such situations, the person who is the source of the conflict (the author) might need to adjust their behavior if it's causing distress. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he didn't consider her feelings and dismissed her request, leading to repeated arguments. However, relationships require both parties to compromise, so it's a bit of a nuanced situation. But based on the given information, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, so A might be the right choice.\n"
