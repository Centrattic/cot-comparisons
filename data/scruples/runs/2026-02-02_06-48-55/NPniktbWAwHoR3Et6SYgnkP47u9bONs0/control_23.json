We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is at fault here. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. He wants to play video games sometimes, but she's upset because she feels she needs to make plans every time he wants to game. She wants him to plan ahead so she can go out or do something else. He argues that she doesn't need to go out just because he's playing games and that she can just relax on her phone or something.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author says they've been together three years and he gave up a lot of his time for the relationship initially. Now that they live together, he's trying to balance his time for gaming with her. She's feeling left out when he's gaming, so she leaves to go to her sister's. The author is defensive, saying she's the type who wants constant attention, but he also wants to game with friends.\n\nFrom the description, the girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling neglected when he plays games. She might feel that when he's engaged in gaming, she has nothing to do, leading her to seek her own time. The author, on the other hand, is trying to maintain his hobby and online friendships without seeing her presence as mandatory during those times.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author and his girlfriend might have different needs in terms of how they spend their time together. The author doesn't seem malicious; he's trying to explain his perspective and suggest alternatives like her using her phone or the laptop. However, the girlfriend's need for her own time or plans when he's occupied is also valid. The problem arises when their expectations clash without mutual understanding.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he's not acknowledging her feelings of loneliness during his gaming sessions. Even if he's not physically leaving, she might feel that her presence is not valued during those times. However, he's also trying to maintain his interests, which is reasonable. But by dismissing her feelings (e.g., joking about her watching him play and later saying she can just relax), he might not be taking her concerns seriously enough. \n\nOn the other hand, she might be overreacting by holding him responsible for her lack of plans and leaving the house multiple times. It's possible she's using his gaming as a reason to go out, which could be a separate issue. The author isn't forcing her to have plans, but her reaction suggests she feels entitled to that time when he's occupied.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response is dismissive of her feelings. If he's not making an effort to find a compromise or better communication, that could be problematic. The fact that he's had to tell her multiple times that she doesn't need to make plans each time he gams suggests a recurring issue. If he's not considering her emotional needs during this time, he might be at fault. However, if she's not being flexible and is instead making it a conflict every time, she might share some responsibility.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal interests with the partner's feelings. The author might not be in the wrong if he's communicating his needs and trying to meet in the middle, but if he's not addressing her feelings appropriately, that's where the problem lies. The answer depends on whether the author is being considerate of her emotions or just sticking to his own desires without regard for her well-being.\n"
