We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their girlfriend living together. The author wants to play games with friends, and the girlfriend expects them to make plans so she can have something to do. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has mentioned giving up free time for dates in the past, which shows they've made sacrifices. Now that they live together, the girlfriend's expectations shifted. She feels neglected when he plays games without involving her. The author tried to accommodate her by suggesting watching him play or using his laptop, but she still feels left out. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author's initial response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, but the girlfriend feels that her needs aren't being met. It's possible that the author's gaming time is affecting her mental well-being if she feels lonely during that time. \n\nHowever, the author also has a right to have hobbies and socialize. The problem seems to be a mismatch in expectations. The girlfriend might expect more inclusion or joint activities, while the author wants independent time. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's not clear if the author is entirely wrong. They tried to explain and compromise, but maybe didn't consider her feelings enough. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might be an overreaction, but her need for attention is valid. \n\nThe author's statement that she \"has nothing else to do\" while he plays suggests that the girlfriend might not have her own activities, which could be a factor. Maybe the author could have encouraged her to pursue her own interests instead of expecting her to make plans every time. \n\nUltimately, the issue is about balancing personal time and relationship time. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to game, but perhaps could have communicated better or found a middle ground. Since the answer requires a binary choice between A or B, and the situation is complex, leaning towards B (not in the wrong) makes sense because the author is expressing their needs and trying to find a solution, even if there's room for improvement.\n"
