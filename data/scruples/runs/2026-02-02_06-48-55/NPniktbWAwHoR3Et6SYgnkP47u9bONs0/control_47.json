We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend live together after being in a 3-year relationship. The main issue is about gaming time. The author wants to play games with friends, but his girlfriend feels left out and wants to make plans when he's gaming. He argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, just relax on her phone or laptop.\n\nSo, the girlfriend's perspective is that when they live separately, he had his own time, but now that they live together, she feels neglected when he games without planning around her. She wants to have her own activities during his gaming time, maybe to not feel lonely. The author, on the other hand, sees gaming as his downtime and doesn't think she needs to leave the house for that. He's okay with her being on her phone nearby.\n\nNow, the key points here. Communication seems to be a big issue. The author initially didn't realize the impact his gaming was having on her. When she expressed her feelings, he tried to reassure her but maybe didn't address her needs properly. The girlfriend is feeling that her emotional needs aren't being met, which is valid. She wants attention and companionship, which is a common expectation in a relationship. The author is trying to balance his personal interests with the relationship, which is also reasonable.\n\nBut the problem arises when the girlfriend feels that her needs are being ignored. The author's response of telling her she can just relax on her phone might not be enough for her emotionally. She might be feeling isolated during his gaming sessions. The fact that she left to go to her sister's house shows she's distressed and not being comforted by his reassurances.\n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't consider the change in their dynamic after moving in together. Before, when they were apart, she had her own space. Now, with cohabitation, the boundaries might need to be redefined. The girlfriend might be struggling with the transition, needing more structured time apart to maintain her independence, which is also a valid need in a relationship.\n\nHowever, the author's stance that she doesn't have to make plans every time might be correct. It's not fair for her to expect him to plan every instance of gaming so she can go out. That could be seen as demanding that he accommodate her every whim rather than finding a middle ground.\n\nBut the author's approach of dismissing her feelings and not giving her enough attention during his downtime could be the issue. He needs to communicate better and find a balance that respects both their needs. Maybe setting aside specific times for her to have her own activities without expecting him to accommodate her every time, while also ensuring that she feels included when he's gaming.\n\nSo, in terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might be at fault for not addressing her emotional needs adequately and not being flexible enough in communication. However, the girlfriend might also be overreacting by expecting him to plan every gaming session for her to leave. But since the question is about the author's responsibility, the answer might lean towards him being somewhat at fault for not considering her feelings and not finding a compromise.\n\nWait, but the author did try to explain that he's not going anywhere and they could talk while he plays. However, the girlfriend still felt neglected. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to game, but maybe in how he handled her feelings. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because gaming is a personal activity, and the girlfriend's request for plans every time is unreasonable. But if the author isn't acknowledging her emotional state, that's a problem. Hmm. It's tricky. The AITA subreddit often emphasizes communication. If the author isn't listening and is dismissive, he might be at fault. But if the girlfriend is being overly demanding, he's not. So, where does the balance lie here?\n"
