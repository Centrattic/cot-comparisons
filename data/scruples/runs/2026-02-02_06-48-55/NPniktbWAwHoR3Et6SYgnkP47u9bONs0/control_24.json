We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. I need to analyze the details provided and determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nThe situation is that the couple lives together. The author wants to play games with friends, but the girlfriend feels neglected and wants to make plans when he's gaming. The author told her she doesn't need to make plans each time he wants to game, which led to arguments. The girlfriend feels she has nothing else to do, and when the author gives her advanced notice, she blames him if she doesn't follow through. The author suggests she can relax or use her phone/laptop instead.\n\nFirst, communication is key here. The girlfriend is expressing her needs for attention and companionship. The author acknowledges that he gave up a lot of time for dates initially. Now, living together, he's trying to balance his gaming time with their relationship. However, the girlfriend feels that when he's gaming, she's left with nothing to do. The author's response is to tell her she doesn't need to go out, just relax. But the girlfriend is upset because she wants quality time together.\n\nThe arguments are recurring, which suggests that the communication isn't effective on both sides. The author's solution of \"just relax\" might not address her deeper need for interaction. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house shows she's hurt and possibly seeking space when upset. The author's jokes about her watching him play might not be helpful in a serious situation.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners should feel heard and respected. The girlfriend's feelings are valid if she's feeling neglected. The author's desire to game is also valid, but it's about finding a balance. The author might be in the right by setting boundaries, but he's not fully addressing her emotional needs. However, the girlfriend's expectation that she must have plans every time he plays could be unrealistic if she's at home. The author's response to let her know in advance is good, but if she's not making plans despite that, maybe the issue is about her expectations versus his needs. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction of leaving for hours and blaming him if she doesn't follow through might be unfair. The author's point is that she doesn't need to go out every time; maybe she's overreacting. However, if the girlfriend feels consistently neglected, that's a problem. The key is mutual understanding and compromise. The author might not be in the wrong if his actions are about maintaining his hobbies and he's open to communication. The girlfriend's demands might be unreasonable, but maybe the author isn't addressing her needs adequately. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person isn't in the wrong if they're being clear and reasonable. The author is stating his boundaries, and the girlfriend's expectations might be the issue. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I need to check if his responses are dismissive. He told her she doesn't need to go out, just relax. That could be dismissive of her feelings. If he's not validating her need for attention, that could make him in the wrong. But if she's overreacting, then he's not. It's a balance. Maybe the answer is B because he's setting boundaries, but there's room for both to adjust. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B because the author is asserting his needs, but maybe the girlfriend's approach is flawed. Alternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's not forcing her to do anything and is offering alternatives. So B.\n"
