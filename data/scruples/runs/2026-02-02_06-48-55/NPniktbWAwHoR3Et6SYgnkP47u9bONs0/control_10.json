We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong in the situation described.\n\nSo, the scenario is that the guy and his girlfriend live together. He's been playing games with his friends, and she's upset because she feels like she has nothing to do when he's gaming. He thought she was joking when he suggested she watch him play, but she took it seriously and started making plans to go out whenever he plays. He then told her she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax or use his laptop. She's upset, and he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy has been in a relationship for three years and moved in with her four months ago. He gave up a lot of his free time initially for dates. Now that they live together, he wants to play games with friends, which is a reasonable request. Gaming is a common hobby, and it's normal for people to want to have some personal time. \n\nOn the other hand, his girlfriend might feel neglected. When they lived apart, he could game on his own time, but now that they're together, she might expect more shared time. She's expressing that she feels left out when he's gaming, so she tries to make plans for herself. Her reaction of going to her sister's house for a few hours shows she's feeling upset enough to leave. The guy's response of telling her she doesn't need to go out every time and just relax could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The guy might not be wrong if he's trying to maintain his hobbies and autonomy in the relationship. However, if his girlfriend consistently feels neglected, it's a problem. The fact that he had to explain that gaming isn't a \"plan\" and that she can watch or use his laptop shows he's trying to accommodate her. But she's not satisfied, and he's pointing out that she's making plans unnecessarily. \n\nIn relationships, balance is important. Both partners should have their needs met. If he's spending too much time gaming without considering her feelings, that's an issue. Conversely, if she's requiring him to pre-plan and she's not flexible, that could also be a problem. The guy's stance is that she doesn't need to make plans every time he plays, and he's encouraging her to relax, which is reasonable. However, the fact that she's feeling the need to go out might indicate that she's not getting enough attention or that the balance is off. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's trying to maintain a hobby and is offering compromises (talking while he plays, her using the laptop), but she's not accepting them and is instead making unilateral plans, then maybe he's not the one at fault. It's possible that she's overreacting or expecting more attention than he's willing to give. However, if he's not acknowledging her feelings and just dismissing them, that could be a problem. \n\nIn the situation described, the guy is trying to balance his own needs with hers. He's not forcing her to do anything; he's suggesting she can relax. The issue might be more about her expectations and how he's handling her reactions. Since he's not forcing her to make plans and is open to her being around, it's possible he's not in the wrong. However, if his gaming time is taking away from shared time or making her feel neglected, then maybe he should adjust. But based on the given info, he's defending his right to have personal time, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the fact that she's being required to make plans every time he plays is unfair. The guy is saying she doesn't need to go out, just relax, which is fair. So, he's not wrong for stating that she can choose to relax instead of making plans. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
