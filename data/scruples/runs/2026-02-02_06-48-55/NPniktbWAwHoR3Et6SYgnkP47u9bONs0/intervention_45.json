We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting to make plans whenever the author wants to game, and the author telling her she doesn't need to. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The couple has been together three years and now lives together. The author used to have gaming time when they were apart but now, since living together, the girlfriend expects him to plan so she can make her own plans. The author finds this unnecessary because she could just relax on her phone or use the laptop. The girlfriend, however, wants to be engaged or have something to do during his gaming time. They had conflicts where she went to her sister's house, and the author thought she was overreacting. \n\nThe main conflict is about boundaries and expectations in a shared living situation. The girlfriend wants to maintain her independence and have her own time, while the author sees gaming with friends as a normal activity that doesn't require her to leave the house. The author is defensive and thinks she's being too demanding, but maybe he's not considering her feelings of loneliness during his gaming sessions. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling neglected when he's gaming. She might be used to having his attention when they live separately and now feels that living together reduces her alone time. The author's response of telling her she can just relax on her phone might not address her need for social interaction or activities. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong if he's clear about wanting his own time, but he could be missing the emotional needs of his partner. The girlfriend's request for pre-planning might be a way to ensure she has time for herself. However, expecting her to leave the house every time could be burdensome. The author's solution of letting her use the laptop or phone is practical, but maybe the girlfriend wants more than just passive activities. \n\nThe author's argument that gaming isn't a plan might be valid, but in a shared space, mutual respect for each other's activities is necessary. The fact that the girlfriend went to her sister's house multiple times suggests she's trying to cope with the situation, but it's not sustainable. The author could be in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings and needs, even if his own need for gaming is valid. \n\nSo, balancing both perspectives: the author's right to his own hobbies and the girlfriend's need for her own time. If the author isn't acknowledging her feelings and is dismissive (joking about her watching him play), that could be problematic. The answer hinges on whether the author is respecting her emotional needs while asserting his own. If he's not making an effort to understand her perspective, he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
