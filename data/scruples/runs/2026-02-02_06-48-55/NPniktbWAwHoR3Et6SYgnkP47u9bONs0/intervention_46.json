We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans, but the author thinks she doesn't need to go out every time he plays.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. They live together and have been for 3 years. The author used to give up his free time for dates but now wants to game. The girlfriend is upset because when he plays, she feels left out and has nothing to do. The author suggests she can watch him play or just relax on her phone, but she goes to her sister's house. The argument happens a few times, and the author tells her she doesn't need to make plans if she can't. He also mentions she wants constant attention, but he wants to play with friends.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girlfriend feels neglected when he plays, wants to have her own plans when he's busy. The author thinks she shouldn't have to leave every time he wants to game, and he's okay with her just relaxing. The girlfriend's reaction is going to her sister's house, which might indicate she's hurt or seeking support. The author's actions are telling her she doesn't need to make plans, but she's holding him accountable for not planning ahead.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider if communication is the main issue here. The author tried to explain he's not going anywhere and they can talk while he plays, but she felt she had nothing to do. The problem might be that the author isn't considering her need for personal space and activities, especially since they live together now. She might feel like her needs aren't being respected when he plays without planning ahead. The author's response to tell her not to make plans if she can't might be dismissive of her feelings. \n\nBut he also mentions that she's the type who wants constant attention, so there's a balance here. Maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but he could be more considerate. However, in a relationship, both partners need to have their needs met. If the girlfriend is feeling left out, the author should be more proactive in finding a middle ground. Instead of dismissing her plans, maybe they could agree on certain times for him to game and other times for them to spend together. The author's approach might be contributing to the conflict by not acknowledging her feelings and pushing back without finding a compromise.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because he's not fully addressing her emotional needs and is dismissing her requests. Even though he has a right to his free time, how he's handling the situation could be more considerate. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's not making enough effort to meet her halfway. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The girlfriend is reacting strongly, maybe overreacting, but the author's response isn't helping. So, maybe A is correct here.\n"
