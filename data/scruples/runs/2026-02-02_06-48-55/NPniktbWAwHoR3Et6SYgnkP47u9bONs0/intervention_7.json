We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The question is about their gaming habits and how their girlfriend reacts.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, have been dating three years. The guy wants to game with friends, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do while he's gaming. He tells her she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. The girlfriend wants him to preplan so she can go out, but he resists, saying she can just relax or use his laptop. They argue multiple times.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and expectations in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend is expressing her feelings of neglect when he's gaming without her making plans. She wants time to herself or to do something. The author, on the other hand, feels that gaming is his downtime and that he's being accommodating by offering her alternatives (watching, chatting, using his laptop). He also mentions she's the type who wants constant attention, which might be a factor here.\n\nBut in a relationship, both partners need to feel their needs are met. The girlfriend's need for her own time or activities is valid. The author might not be wrong in wanting his gaming time, but dismissing her feelings by saying she doesn't need to make plans could be seen as not taking her concerns seriously. The fact that she felt compelled to leave the house multiple times suggests she's not getting her needs met, which the author isn't addressing adequately.\n\nThe author's response of telling her to just relax or use his laptop might be minimizing her feelings. Healthy communication would involve finding a compromise, like setting specific gaming times where he knows she can have time to herself, or maybe finding activities they can do together when he's gaming. The author isn't wrong entirely, but there's a lack of consideration for her emotional needs, which is a problem. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not addressing her valid emotional needs and is dismissive rather than compromising.\n"
