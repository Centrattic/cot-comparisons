We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who wants the author to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans, but he's saying she doesn't need to go out every time.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his girlfriend live together and have been together for three years. When they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, but now that they live together, he's trying to game. The girlfriend is upset that when he plays games, she's left with nothing to do. The author offered her to watch him play or use his laptop, but she went to her sister's house. Then he told her she doesn't need to make plans, just chill on her phone or use the laptop. Now she's upset because she wants constant attention, but he wants to game with friends.\n\nHmm. So the girlfriend feels neglected when he plays games. She wants to be engaged or have her own plans during that time. The author is defending his right to game, saying she doesn't need to leave the house. But maybe he's not considering her emotional needs. Even though he's offering her to watch or use the laptop, she might feel that's not the attention she wants. She might crave more interaction or quality time together instead of him being absorbed in a game. The author might be in the right in wanting his personal time, but the problem is how it's affecting their relationship. \n\nThe key issue here is communication. The author says he's not going anywhere and they can talk while he plays. But she's still feeling left out, which suggests that their expectations aren't aligned. The girlfriend might need more active engagement, while the author sees gaming as a passive activity where she can do her own thing. However, when someone is playing games, especially with friends, it's a lot more interactive and can distract from being present for the partner. \n\nThe author's argument is that she doesn't need to leave the house every time he plays, but maybe she's feeling that she's being ignored during those times. If the girlfriend is used to getting constant attention, then the author's gaming time might be a source of tension. He might need to find a balance between his personal time and her need for attention. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also not wrong to want time for himself. The question is whether he's being inconsiderate by not adjusting to her needs. It's a common issue where partners have different needs for alone time vs. togetherness. The author's response, telling her she can just use the laptop or phone, might be dismissive of her feelings. \n\nThe author's main point is that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. But if she feels that her plans are being disrupted or her attention is being neglected, then maybe the author is not considering her perspective. The fact that she went to her sister's house shows she's not comfortable with the situation, and the argument repeats when she fails to make plans. \n\nSo, maybe the author is partially in the wrong because he's not addressing her emotional needs. Even if he's allowed to game, he should find a way to make her feel included or at least acknowledged. The solution might involve compromise, like setting specific times for gaming where they can both agree, or incorporating her into the activity if possible. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's approach of dismissing her need to make plans and telling her to just use the laptop might be the problem. While he has the right to personal time, he's not addressing her feelings of neglect, which is why she's upset. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering her emotional needs and communication adequately.\n"
