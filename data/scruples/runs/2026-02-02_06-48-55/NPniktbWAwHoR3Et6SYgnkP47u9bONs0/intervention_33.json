We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who wants the author to plan gaming time in advance so she can make her own plans, but the author doesn't think she needs to. The author just wants to game and says she can relax or use his laptop.\n\nHmm. The girlfriend is upset because she feels neglected when he plays games. She wants to have her own activities when he's gaming. The author, on the other hand, feels like gaming is his downtime and doesn't see why she should make plans every time. He even jokes about her watching him play, but she takes it seriously.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about mutual expectations and communication. The girlfriend might feel that when they live together, their time should be spent together, and when he's gaming, she's left alone. The author might not realize that even though they live together, she values having her own space and activities. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to go out and can just relax. But maybe he's dismissing her need for personal space. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house for a few hours might be her way of coping with feeling ignored. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not intentionally trying to hurt her, but he's not acknowledging her feelings. He's prioritizing his own needs without considering that she might need her own time. However, he's also expressing his need to game with friends, which is reasonable. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance both partners' needs. The problem might be that the author didn't communicate enough or adjust to her needs. He says he's fine with her wanting attention, but maybe he's not flexible enough when it comes to her needing her own space. \n\nSo, maybe the author is partially in the wrong because he's not giving her the space she needs. But then again, she's expecting him to plan ahead, which might be a bit much. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. It depends on how both parties approach their needs. The key here is communication. If the author had a conversation about balancing their needs, maybe they could find a middle ground. But as it stands, he's not considering her feelings enough. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
