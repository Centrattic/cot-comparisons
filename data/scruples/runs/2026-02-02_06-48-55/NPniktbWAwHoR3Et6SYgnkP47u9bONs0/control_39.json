We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple living together for four months, and the girlfriend is upset when the guy plays games without making plans for her.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: They've been together three years, and he's adjusting to living together. The girlfriend feels left out when he plays games. He argues that she doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming. She wants some time to herself or with friends, but when he plays, she expects plans. He told her she doesn't need to go out, just relax. She's upset, leading to arguments.\n\nKey points to consider: Communication is crucial in relationships. The girlfriend feels neglected when he plays games. The author is trying to balance his own interests (gaming with friends) with her needs. However, he didn't consider her feelings initially, dismissing her concerns as needing to make plans. He did offer solutions like her watching him play or talking, but she didn't like that. He later told her she doesn't need to make plans, which might come off as dismissive. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's trying to maintain his hobbies, but maybe he didn't validate her feelings enough. The girlfriend's feeling of missing him when he's gaming suggests she needs more attention. The author's response of saying she can relax on her phone might not address her emotional needs. But he's also not wrong for wanting to game. The balance here is tricky. However, in relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. If he's not willing to adjust his gaming time or she's not getting her needs met, there's a problem. But the author's actions here\u2014telling her she doesn't have to make plans every time he plays\u2014might be seen as reasonable because it's his leisure time. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house multiple times could be unnecessary. \n\nBut AITA often looks at communication and empathy. The author might not have adequately addressed her feelings of neglect. Even if gaming is his thing, the girlfriend's emotional needs are valid. He dismissed her need to have her own plans, which she sees as important. So maybe he's in the wrong for not being more considerate of her perspective. However, he's also not entirely to blame because he's expressing his need to game. The answer might depend on cultural norms or relationship dynamics. But in this case, since he's the one making the decision without considering her feelings, AITA might lean towards A (he's in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because he's also trying to maintain his independence. Hmm.\n"
