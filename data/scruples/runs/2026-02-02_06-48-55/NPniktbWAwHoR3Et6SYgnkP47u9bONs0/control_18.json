We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend live together. They've been together three years, and he's been giving up his free time for dates and couple stuff before. Now that they're living together, he wants to game with his friends, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels she has nothing to do while he's gaming. The author told her she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game, and she went to her sister's house a few times, leading to arguments.\n\nFirst, communication seems key here. The author thought he was being considerate by joking that she could watch him play, but she wasn't kidding and felt neglected. He mentioned she's the type who wants constant attention, so maybe he should have been more aware of her needs. However, he also has his own needs to relax and game with friends. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's might indicate she feels the gaming is taking precedence over their time together. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, but that might not address her underlying need for companionship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance his personal time with their relationship. He's not going out of the house, just playing games at home. The problem arises when the girlfriend feels like she's being left out. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can both have their needs met. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. He's not doing anything harmful, like cheating or neglecting responsibilities. However, in a relationship, both partners need to feel valued. If the girlfriend is consistently feeling ignored, the author should make more effort to include her or find times when he can game without her feeling excluded. \n\nHe did try to communicate that they could talk while he plays, but she wanted more. The author's response to tell her she doesn't need to go out might have been dismissive of her feelings. Instead of dismissing her need to have her own plans, he should have discussed how they can spend time together in a way that works for both. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is partially in the wrong for not addressing her feelings adequately. But it's also a two-way street. The girlfriend might need to communicate her needs better too. However, according to the AITA framework, the answer might lean towards the author needing to adjust his approach. I think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings enough and his response might have been dismissive.\n"
