We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's living with his girlfriend. They've been together for three years and he's been doing a lot of gaming. When they first started dating, he gave up some of his free time for dates and stuff, but now that they live together, he wants to game with friends and she's upset because she feels like she has nothing to do when he plays.\n\nHe says when he told her he wanted to play Apex Legends, she didn't like it because she had nothing else to do. He offered for her to watch, but she wanted him to make plans so she could be busy. He told her she didn't need to go out, just relax or use his laptop. But she kept acting like it was his fault if she didn't have plans. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, communication is key in relationships. The author mentioned that he gave her advanced notice sometimes, but she still felt like she had to make plans. Maybe he didn't consider that she might not just want to watch him play. Maybe she needs her own space or activities. But he's also trying to maintain his own hobbies, which is normal.\n\nShe went to her sister's house a few times when he was gaming. That could be her way of coping, but maybe it's making things tense. He's saying she's the type who wants constant attention, but he also wants his own time. It seems like a balance issue.\n\nHe says she blames him when she doesn't make plans, but maybe she's feeling neglected. The author's response of telling her she doesn't have to go out might be dismissive of her feelings. Maybe he should have asked how she felt instead of just assuming she can just relax. It's possible he's not considering her need for social activities or downtime, which is valid.\n\nOn the other hand, he's also entitled to his own time and interests. The problem is that their expectations aren't aligned. He thought gaming casually without planning was fine, but she wanted scheduled activities so she could have her own time. That mismatch might be the real issue. So he's not entirely wrong, but maybe he could have approached it with more empathy. However, the question is if he is in the wrong. Since he's defending his right to game without her having to make plans, but she's feeling that her needs aren't met, it's a bit of a gray area. But since he's the one adjusting his behavior, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's not considering her emotional needs, he might be. But I'm leaning towards B, No, he's not in the wrong because both need some space.\n"
