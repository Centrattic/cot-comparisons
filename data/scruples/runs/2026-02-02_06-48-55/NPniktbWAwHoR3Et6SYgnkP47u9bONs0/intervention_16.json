We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple living together. The guy wants to play games with his friends, and his girlfriend is upset because she feels left out when he's gaming. He argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game, suggesting she can just relax or use her phone.\n\nHmm. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be that when he plays games, she has nothing to do. She wants to know in advance so she can make her own plans. The author is saying that she doesn't need to go out every time and that she can just chill. But the girlfriend feels neglected because she's not interested in watching him play games and prefers to have her own activities. \n\nSo, communication is a big part here. The author says he told her he's going to play games and offered alternatives. But the girlfriend is still upset because she wants to be involved or have her own plans. Maybe the problem is that the author isn't considering her need for personal time. While he has the right to spend time doing what he likes, it's important to balance both partners' needs. \n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend went to her sister's house for a few hours, which suggests she felt the need to leave to have something to do. If she's not interested in being around during his gaming sessions, maybe he should respect that and give her space. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be a bit over the top if she's expecting him to plan his gaming around her schedule every time. \n\nIt's a bit of a push and pull. The author wants his gaming time, she wants her own time. The key is mutual respect and compromise. The author's response might be dismissive of her feelings, thinking she can just \"chill on her phone,\" but maybe she needs more than that. If he's not willing to adjust his gaming time to accommodate her schedule, but she feels it's necessary, that could be a conflict point. \n\nI think the author might not be in the wrong entirely because everyone needs some personal hobbies. But he could be missing the point of her needing to feel involved or have her own plans. The answer might depend on how they communicate and find a middle ground. Since the boyfriend is trying to explain that she doesn't need to plan around his gaming, and the girlfriend is expecting him to adjust, it's a bit of a conflict in expectations. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he's standing up for his own needs and clarifying that she doesn't have to plan something every time. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. The girlfriend might need to express her needs more clearly, while the author could be more flexible. However, the fact that the author is making it clear that she doesn't need to make plans each time might be the right approach, so he's not wrong.\n"
