We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together, have been together three years. The issue started when the girlfriend expected him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that when they first dated, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, but now that they live together, he wants to game. The girlfriend feels it's unfair because she has nothing to do while he's gaming. He suggested she watch him, but she insisted on making plans if he's going to \"make plans.\" He argues that just because he's playing games doesn't mean she needs to go out; she can relax or use his laptop. But she ends up getting upset when he plays without prior notice.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be that she feels neglected when he's gaming. She wants time to herself or with others, which is understandable. However, the author is also asserting his need for personal time. The problem arises when the girlfriend blames him for not planning and feels he should accommodate her, while he thinks she should just relax. \n\nThe author's response of telling her she doesn't need to plan every time might be valid because he's not leaving the house; he's just playing games. However, the recurring arguments suggest that there's a lack of mutual understanding. The girlfriend might feel that her needs aren't being considered, especially if she's used to constant attention. On the other hand, the author is trying to balance his own hobbies. \n\nIt's a matter of balancing both partners' needs. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to game, but he might need to communicate better and find a compromise. However, since he's stating his position clearly and suggesting alternatives (like her using the laptop or phone), he's not entirely at fault. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from unmet expectations about shared time versus individual space. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are considered dismissive of her feelings, but given the context, it's more about differing needs and communication issues rather than clear fault.\n"
