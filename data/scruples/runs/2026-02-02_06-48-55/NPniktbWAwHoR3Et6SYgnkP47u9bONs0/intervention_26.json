We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been together three years and live together now. The issue started when he wanted to play Apex Legends with a friend. He told her he was going to play, and she got upset because she felt she had nothing to do while he was gaming. The author thought she was joking when he suggested she watch him play, but she took it seriously. She ended up going to her sister's house for a few hours. This led to repeated arguments where she expected him to plan his gaming so she could make her own plans. He told her she didn't need to go out, just relax or use her phone/laptop. He says she wants constant attention but he also wants his game time.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are communication and expectations. When they started living together, their schedules are overlapping more. The author had previously given up a lot of his free time for dates, but now he wants his own time. The girlfriend feels neglected when he's gaming because she's not doing anything else. The author is defensive, thinking she should just chill or use her phone instead of making plans. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems valid because she's living with him and might expect some independence but also some shared time. The author's initial reaction was to dismiss her feelings by suggesting she watch him play, which wasn't taken well. Then, when she went to her sister's, he played games, which could come off as dismissive. \n\nThe argument arises because the girlfriend wants pre-planning so she can have her own time, which is reasonable. The author, on the other hand, doesn't see why she needs to make plans just because he's gaming. But when you live together, having separate activities can be tricky. The author might not be considering her need for personal time as much as his own. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not wrong for wanting his own time. But he might not be wrong either. However, the way he's handling it could be part of the problem. By not acknowledging her feelings and suggesting she just relax or use her phone, he might be invalidating her need for her own space. Maybe they need to find a middle ground where they both have time for themselves but also respect each other's needs. \n\nThe girlfriend's expectation that he should plan his gaming so she can make plans might be a bit much if he's just having casual game sessions. But her feeling neglected is real. The author's response of \"she doesn't need to go out\" is dismissive. Maybe he should be more open to communicating and finding a balance. \n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't entirely wrong for wanting his hobbies, but he might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and not finding a compromise. The girlfriend's needs for attention and personal time are valid. So perhaps the author is partially in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether he is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering all that, I think the answer might be A because he's not considering her feelings adequately and is dismissive. However, some might argue B because he has a right to his hobbies. But given the context of their living together and her needing attention, the answer is likely A. Wait, but maybe not. Let me check again. \n\nThe author's actions stem from wanting his own time, which is reasonable. However, his response to her feelings was dismissive. He could have been more empathetic. So maybe it's a shared fault, but the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he's the one who's causing the conflict by not addressing her feelings, maybe A is correct. So I'll go with A.\n"
