We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living together where the guy wants to play games with friends, and the girlfriend is upset that she has to make plans or do something else when he's gaming. The author is saying he's not in the wrong because he thinks she doesn't need to go out just because he wants to play games.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy has been in a relationship for three years and has compromised by giving up some free time before. Now that they live together, he wants to game, which is a normal hobby. The girlfriend feels neglected when he's gaming and wants him to plan ahead so she can make her own plans. She went to her sister's house when he was gaming, which the guy found odd. Then he told her she doesn't need to make plans because she can just relax or use his laptop. The argument came up multiple times, and she blamed him when she didn't have plans.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The guy is trying to maintain his hobby, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend feels like her needs aren't being met. When they live together, shared time and personal time can be a balance. The author's response might be dismissive of her feelings. By telling her she doesn't need to make plans, he might be invalidating her need for personal time or activities. Also, she mentioned missing him, which implies she feels lonely when he's gaming. The guy's solution of \"just relax or use the laptop\" might not address her emotional needs.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. The guy might be in the right to want to play games, but he needs to communicate better and find a compromise. The girlfriend might need to express her needs more clearly, but her reaction of going to her sister's house might be a way to cope with feeling ignored. The author's dismissiveness could be the problem here. He says he's not in the wrong, but maybe not considering her feelings as much as he should. So, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because he's not addressing her need for connection and is being dismissive of her feelings even though he acknowledges she wants attention.\n"
