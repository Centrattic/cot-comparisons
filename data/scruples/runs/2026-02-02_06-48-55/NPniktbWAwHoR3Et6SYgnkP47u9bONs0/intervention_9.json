We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting to have plans every time he wants to game. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they live together and have been together for three years. The issue started when the author wanted to play Apex Legends with a friend, and the girlfriend felt she should be informed in advance so she could have her own plans. The author initially thought this was a joke but then the girlfriend left to his sister's house, which led to arguments. The author points out that he thought gaming wasn't a \"plan\" and that she didn't need to go out. He also says she's someone who wants constant attention, but he wants to play with friends.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The girlfriend might feel that when they live together, her time is also important. She might want some personal time or social time, and if the author is gaming, she expects to have her own activities. The author, on the other hand, values his gaming time as a way to relax and connect with friends. The key here is communication and mutual understanding.\n\nThe author's response to the girlfriend's needs was dismissive. He made a joke about her watching him play and later told her she doesn't need to go out. That might not have been the best approach. It's possible that the girlfriend felt ignored or that her needs weren't being considered. However, the author also has a right to personal time. The problem arises when the girlfriend's reaction is to leave and blame him, even when he gives her notice.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance each other's needs. The author might have failed to acknowledge his girlfriend's feelings adequately. Instead of joking, he should have engaged in a serious conversation to find a middle ground. The girlfriend might need boundaries set for when the author games, and the author might need to compromise by limiting gaming time or finding activities they can do together. The fact that the girlfriend is \"the kind of girl who wants constant attention\" suggests that her needs are significant, but the author's need for personal time is also valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's mistake was not addressing his girlfriend's concerns respectfully and considering her feelings. He could have been more empathetic and found a solution that works for both. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, it's a bit of a grey area because both sides have valid points. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and he didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective adequately, I think A is the correct answer.\n"
