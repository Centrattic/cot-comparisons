We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their girlfriend living together. The main issue is that the author plays games with friends, and the girlfriend feels she needs to make plans every time he wants to game.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. They've been together three years and live together now. When they first started dating, the author gave up a lot of free time for dates. Now, when they live together, the author wants to play games, which the girlfriend is upset about. She wants him to plan ahead so she can go out if needed. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out each time and can just relax.\n\nSo, the core of the conflict is about boundaries and expectations in their shared living situation. The author's girlfriend feels neglected when he's gaming, expecting him to make time for her, while the author wants to maintain his own hobbies and social activities.\n\nThe author claims he's not going anywhere and that they can talk while he plays. However, the girlfriend's reaction was to go to her sister's house, indicating she felt hurt or uninvolved. The author then tells her she doesn't need to make plans, just relax or use his laptop. He also mentions she wants constant attention but he wants his own downtime.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, mutual respect is key. Both partners should have space for their own interests. However, communication is crucial. The author didn't anticipate that the girlfriend might feel left out when he plays. The girlfriend's need for attention is valid, but the author's need for personal time is also understandable.\n\nThe author's mistake might be not discussing this with her beforehand. He assumed she'd be okay with watching or relaxing. But since they live together, his gaming time affects her. The girlfriend's reaction shows she might need more consideration for her feelings. On the other hand, the author is correct in that she doesn't have to make plans every time just because he's gaming. There's a balance needed here.\n\nThe author's response to her complaints by telling her to relax or use the laptop might come off as dismissive. He should have been more empathetic. But he's also within his rights to have personal time. The main issue here is communication. If they can't find a middle ground, the author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate, but the problem isn't entirely his if both have valid needs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Both could be at fault for not communicating better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's asserting his right to have gaming time and suggesting compromise (talking while he plays), but also not fully considering her feelings, there's a mix. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author isn't entirely wrong either. However, in relationships, considering the other's feelings is important. The author might be slightly in the wrong for not anticipating her feelings and for being dismissive, but not entirely. Still, the question requires choosing A or B. Considering that both have valid points, but the author's actions led to the conflict, maybe A is more appropriate. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he's not wrong because he's also expressing his needs and she's overreacting? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not wrong because he's maintaining his own interests, but he should have communicated better. Since the answer is either A or B, and the question is if he's in the wrong, perhaps the answer is B (No), because he's not entirely at fault, but maybe a combination. However, in AITA scenarios, often the answer is based on social norms. The girlfriend's reaction seems a bit excessive, but the author's approach could be more considerate. Since the user is the one asking, maybe the answer is B, but I'm a bit torn. Let me check again.\n\nThe author's main point is that the girlfriend is making demands every time he wants to play. He's trying to balance his interests with her needs. The girlfriend's issue is that she feels neglected. The author's response is to tell her she doesn't need to go out, which is correct. However, the author could have been more proactive in ensuring her feelings are considered. But in terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't wrong because he's asserting his right to personal time. The girlfriend's expectations might be unreasonable. So the answer could be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
