We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and their girlfriend living together, and the girlfriend is upset when he plays video games without making plans for her to do something else. The author argues that the girlfriend doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend wants to be included or have something to do when the author is gaming. She feels left out and misses him when he's focused on games. The author, on the other hand, wants to spend time with friends online and play games, which he used to do when they were apart. Now that they live together, the expectations might have shifted.\n\nThe author says he's okay with the girlfriend wanting attention, but also wants his own downtime. However, the girlfriend is reacting negatively, going to her sister's house for hours, which seems like a significant reaction. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. \n\nI should think about communication. The girlfriend expressed that she feels neglected when he's gaming, which is a valid feeling. The author tried to accommodate by suggesting they could talk while he plays or she could watch, but she wasn't into it. The key issue here is mutual understanding and compromise. The author might be in the right in wanting his own time, but he needs to consider his partner's feelings. If the girlfriend feels consistently left out, it's a problem. However, the author's response of not requiring her to make plans each time could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can find time for both individual and couple activities. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's approach of making plans every time the author wants to game might be excessive, especially if she's not interested in participating. The author's assertion that she doesn't have to go out but can just relax might be reasonable, but the girlfriend's emotional reaction suggests deeper issues about feeling valued. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel heard. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting personal time, but the way he dismissed her feelings could be problematic. He should communicate better and find a balance. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but her need for connection is valid. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were hurtful or neglectful. If the author is using game time as an excuse to avoid spending quality time with his partner, that's an issue. However, if he's just seeking personal space and the girlfriend can't accept that, then maybe she's being unreasonable. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because everyone needs personal time, but he could have handled the situation more sensitively. However, the girlfriend's feelings are real, so maybe there's a shared responsibility here. But according to the options given, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the author is asserting his right to personal time, which is reasonable, but perhaps not in a way that fully respects his partner's needs, it's a bit tricky. However, the girlfriend's approach of making plans every time might be the issue. The author's response to tell her she doesn't need to make plans is a valid stance if she's not interested in participating. So, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuanced aspect here.\n"
