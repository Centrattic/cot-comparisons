We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans, but the author thinks she doesn't need to go out every time he plays.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. They live together, been together three years. The author used to game alone before, but now that they live together, his girlfriend is upset when he games without making plans with her. She feels neglected and wants to have her own plans when he's gaming. The author argues that she doesn't need to leave if he's just gaming and that she can chill nearby. They've had arguments about this a few times.\n\nSo, the main issue is about expectations in their relationship. The girlfriend wants more attention and time with him, while he wants to game with friends. When they first dated, he gave up a lot of free time, but now that they live together, there's a conflict. The author's stance is that she doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming. He's trying to balance his personal time with her need for attention.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did try to explain that she could watch him play or use her phone, but she felt that wasn't enough. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house multiple times might indicate she feels her needs aren't being met. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to go out could be seen as dismissing her feelings. Maybe he didn't consider that she genuinely feels left out when he's absorbed in gaming without her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to his own hobbies and time. However, since they live together, he might need to adjust when gaming, especially if it's causing her distress. The problem arises when his gaming becomes a pattern that makes her feel neglected. The fact that he had to ask for advice suggests there's a lack of resolution. \n\nIs the author wrong? It's a balance. If he's not making an effort to include her when possible or if he's gaming excessively without considering her feelings, then he might be in the wrong. But if they had a mutual understanding that he could game and she could do her own thing, maybe not. The issue here is that the girlfriend is feeling the need to make plans every time he wants to game, which might be a reaction to past neglect. The author's refusal to adjust might be the problem.\n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could be missing the point. The girlfriend's need for attention is valid, and the author should find a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not making her plans mandatory, but the conflict arises from her feeling the need to have plans, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with the understanding that communication and compromise are needed. But some might argue that he's in the wrong for not being considerate enough. Hmm.\n"
