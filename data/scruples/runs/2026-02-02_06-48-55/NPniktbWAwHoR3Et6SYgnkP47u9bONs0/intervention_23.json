We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who wants plans made every time he wants to game, and he's resisting that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they live together now, which probably means they spend more time together. The girlfriend is upset because when he plays games, she feels left out and has nothing to do. She wants him to pre-plan so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time and can just relax on her phone or use the laptop.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The girlfriend is expressing her needs, which is valid. She feels neglected when he's gaming and wants her own time. The author is trying to balance his personal time with her needs. However, by not making plans and expecting her to just relax, maybe he's not fully considering her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel valued and heard. The author's initial reaction was to dismiss her concerns with jokes (\"watch me play\"), which might have been dismissive. Then he tried to explain that it's not a plan, but she still went to her sister's, indicating she felt hurt. The author's solution of telling her she can just relax or use her phone might not address her need for independence or social activities. \n\nThe girlfriend's approach of making plans every time might be excessive, but her feelings are valid. The author could have found a middle ground, like setting specific gaming times and checking in with her, rather than insisting she doesn't need to make plans. \n\nSo, while the author has a right to his personal time, the way he's handling the situation might be dismissive of his girlfriend's emotional needs. Communication is key here. The author might be wrong in not acknowledging her feelings and not finding a compromise that respects both their needs. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
