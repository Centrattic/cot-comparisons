We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about gaming time with a girlfriend. The user (AITA) lives with his girlfriend and they've been together three years. He's trying to game with friends, but she's upset because she feels left out when he plays. He argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game, and she's the one who wants constant attention. \n\nFirst, communication seems like a big issue here. The girlfriend is upset that when he plays games, she's left with nothing to do. The author mentions he told her he was going to play and offered for her to watch or use his laptop, but she didn't want that. He then told her she doesn't need to make plans every time he games, which led to arguments. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and compromise. The girlfriend might feel neglected if he's gaming without considering her needs. On the other hand, the author has a right to his own hobbies and downtime. However, the way he's handling it might be the problem. By not considering her feelings and dismissing her need for plans, he might be contributing to the conflict. \n\nHe says she's the type who wants constant attention, but maybe he's not balancing his own needs with hers. Saying she doesn't need to make plans every time might be dismissive of her feeling that she's not included. Also, when she tried to make plans and failed, she blamed him, which suggests there's a cycle of frustration here. \n\nThe author could be in the wrong because he's not addressing her emotional needs. Even if gaming is important to him, the girlfriend's feelings of being left out aren't being validated. The solution might involve finding a middle ground where both can have their needs met, like setting specific gaming times when they can be together or finding activities they can do together. \n\nBut wait, the author did try to communicate that she could use his laptop or watch. Maybe he's not entirely wrong because he's making an effort. However, the fact that she went to her sister's house and they kept arguing shows that communication isn't resolving the issue. It's possible that both sides have valid points but aren't effectively addressing each other's needs. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance individual and shared time. If the girlfriend expects him to always include her when he's gaming, that's a lot to ask. On the flip side, if he's not willing to make time for her when he's gaming, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time might be a reaction to her being upset, but it's not solving the underlying issue. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he's asserting his need for personal time, but he's also not fully addressing her emotional needs, which could make him partially at fault. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is seeking inclusion and he's dismissing her plans, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
