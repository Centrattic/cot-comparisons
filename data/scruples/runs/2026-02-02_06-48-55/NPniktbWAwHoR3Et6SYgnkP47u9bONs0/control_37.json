We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author wanting to play video games and their girlfriend being upset because she feels left out.\n\nFirst, they live together now, which means they're spending more time together than before. The author used to play games when they were in separate houses, but now that they're living together, the girlfriend is upset when he plays without her. She wants him to tell her in advance so she can make plans to do something else, like going out. The author thinks she doesn't need to go out every time and can just relax on her phone or use the laptop.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he plays games without her. Even if he's not leaving the house, the fact that he's focused on gaming could make her feel ignored. She might be trying to assert her need for personal time and social interaction, which is valid. Communication is key here. The author might not realize how his actions affect her emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to his own hobbies and relaxation. Gaming is his way to unwind, and the girlfriend is asking for something that might not be realistic\u2014like making plans every time he wants to game. The author's point about her not needing to go out every time might be right because she could just do something else. But the fact that she feels the need to go out suggests she's not comfortable just staying at home alone while he's gaming. That's a communication issue between them.\n\nThe author's response of saying she doesn't need to make plans and to relax might come off as dismissive. Even if he's not wrong in wanting to game, how he communicated it could be part of the problem. He might need to validate her feelings more and find a compromise, like setting specific times for gaming or other activities where they can both do their own things but still be together.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Both have valid points. The author isn't entirely wrong because he has the right to his hobbies, but he might need to adjust his approach to consider his girlfriend's feelings. The problem seems more about communication and finding a balance rather than outright wrongdoing. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that they need to communicate better.\n"
