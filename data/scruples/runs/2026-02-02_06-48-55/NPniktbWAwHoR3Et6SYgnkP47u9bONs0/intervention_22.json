We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario is about a couple living together where the guy wants to game, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels she needs to make plans whenever he wants to play. The author defends himself by saying the girlfriend wants constant attention but he also wants to game with friends.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author initially gave up his free time for dates but now wants to game. When he mentions playing Apex, his girlfriend reacts by saying it's unfair because she has nothing to do. He tried to make her feel comfortable by saying she could watch, but she wanted to make plans instead. The author then tells her she doesn't need to go out every time, just relax. The girlfriend is upset, leading to arguments.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a relationship perspective, both partners should communicate their needs and find a balance. The author is asserting his need for personal time, which is valid, but maybe he's dismissing his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he's gaming and not engaging with her, hence her need to make plans. However, the author is also trying to maintain his hobbies, which are important for his well-being.\n\nThe issue might be that the author didn't address her feelings properly. He tried to downplay her concerns by saying she can watch or relax, but she might need more active engagement. The fact that she goes to her sister's house when he's gaming could indicate she feels isolated. The author might be in the wrong if he's not listening to her emotional needs. However, it's also about mutual respect for each other's time. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to meet in the middle. The author is right to have his own interests, but he should consider how his actions affect her. Maybe finding a compromise where they have dedicated couple time and individual time would help. The answer might depend on whether the author is being dismissive or if they can both negotiate their needs. Since the author is trying to assert his right to game time but the girlfriend is feeling neglected, there's a balance issue. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but he could be improving his communication and showing more empathy towards her feelings. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong) but with the understanding that both need to work on communication.\n"
