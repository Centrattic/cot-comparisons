We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe couple has been together three years and lives together. The author used to game alone when they were in separate houses, and now that they live together, the girlfriend is upset when he plays games. She feels it's unfair because she has nothing to do while he's gaming. The author initially thought she was joking when she said she wanted to watch him play, but she wanted actual plans. The argument arises because she expects him to plan his gaming so she can make her own plans, but he thinks she doesn't need to do that and can just use her phone or relax. The author's stance is that he's not wrong because they're together, and he should be able to game without her needing to make plans each time.\n\nNow, considering relationships, communication is key. Both partners need to feel heard. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling neglected during his gaming time. She wants time for herself, which is valid. However, the author's response to her feelings by dismissing her plan-making as unnecessary might be the issue. He's not wrong in wanting to game, but maybe not addressing her emotional needs properly.\n\nThe author says she's the type who wants constant attention, which he's fine with. But when he's gaming, she's left without plans. If he's not engaging with her during that time, she might feel ignored. His solution is for her to just relax, but that might not address her need for her own time. Maybe the problem is that he didn't take her feelings seriously enough. Instead of making her go out, she might need more quality time together when he's not gaming. \n\nBut the author argues that she doesn't need to make plans every time he games. That could be reasonable, but the girlfriend's need for her own space is a valid concern. The author might be missing that she's not just being clingy but actually needs some space. However, the girlfriend's response of going to her sister's house might be excessive if it's every time he wants to game. \n\nThe key here is balance. Both need to adjust. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because he has the right to his hobbies. However, he could be more empathetic to her feelings. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not considering her feelings and is dismissive, maybe he is. But if his answer is that he's not wrong because she can just relax, then maybe he's not. \n\nHmm, this is a bit tricky. The girlfriend's need for her own time is valid, but the author's right to game is also valid. If the girlfriend is reacting overly and the author is trying to accommodate by suggesting she just relax, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if her feelings are legitimate and he's not addressing them properly, then he might be. \n\nIn the end, it's a communication issue. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to game, but he might be wrong for not acknowledging her feelings and not finding a middle ground. However, the answer depends on whether the girlfriend's demands are reasonable. If she's expecting him to plan around her all the time, that's a problem. But if she just wants some autonomy, maybe the author should adjust. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because both sides have valid points and it's a communication problem rather than one person being entirely at fault.\n"
