We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time they want to game. They live together now, which is a big change from before when they had separate spaces. The girlfriend is upset because she feels it's not fair for him to play games when she has nothing else to do. The author tried to explain that she can watch, talk, or just relax on her phone, but she keeps insisting on making plans to go out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has loved their relationship and gave up free time before. Now that they live together, their time is shared more. The girlfriend might feel that he's prioritizing gaming over their time together. When they were apart, he had his own downtime, but now they're cohabiting, she might expect more shared time or at least communication about his plans. \n\nHe says she wants constant attention, which could be a factor. However, he also wants time to play with friends. The key issue here is about expectations and boundaries. When you live with someone, you have to balance personal time and shared time. The author might be in a position where he's not wrong for wanting to game, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings properly. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was to leave the house for a few hours when he was gaming, which might not be necessary if he's comfortable with her being present. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, which could come off as dismissive. Maybe he should have acknowledged her need for personal time but also discussed ways to compromise. \n\nAlso, he mentioned she blamed him even when she didn't have plans. That could indicate a pattern where she's not using the time he's gaming productively but is instead expecting him to be available all the time. The author's suggestion that she can use his laptop or phone is a valid point, but if she's not doing that and instead feels neglected, there might be an underlying issue about how they spend time together.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like both have valid points. The author is not wrong for wanting gaming time, but maybe he needs to communicate better and find a middle ground. However, the girlfriend's expectation that he must always be available might be unreasonable. The author's statement that she doesn't need to plan around his gaming could be correct, but the way it's handled matters. If he's dismissive, that's a problem, but if he's trying to be reasonable, maybe not. The answer might depend on how they communicate and respect each other's needs. I think the author is not in the wrong (B) because it's about mutual respect and finding a balance. The girlfriend's constant need for plans might not be necessary if they can coexist in the same space. But there's a nuance here. Maybe the author should have been more considerate in how he frames his request to game, but the core issue is about different expectations, not one party being wrong entirely.\n"
