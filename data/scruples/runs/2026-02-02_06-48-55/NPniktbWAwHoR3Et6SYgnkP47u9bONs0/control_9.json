We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. So, I need to analyze the scenario from both sides.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend are living together. They've been together for 3 years. The author used to have his own gaming time when they weren't living together, but now that they are, the girlfriend is upset when he plays games. She wants him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans. The author thinks she doesn't need to do that because she can just relax or use the laptop.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about expectations and communication. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he's gaming because they're always together now. Before, she had her own time when he was at his place. Now, when he's home, she might want to spend time with him or have her own activities, but he's occupied. She's asking for planning so she can make her own plans, which the author is dismissing.\n\nThe author says he's jokingly suggested she watch him play, but she's serious. Then she leaves to go to her sister's, which might be her way of coping. The author then tells her she doesn't need to go out, just chill. The girlfriend might feel that her needs aren't being considered. The author might be in his right to want his gaming time, but maybe he's not considering how it affects her. \n\nIn relationships, balance is important. Both need to have some personal space and time. But when one partner's activity is causing the other to feel ignored, there should be a discussion. The author's approach of not planning and expecting her to just chill might not be fair. Also, the girlfriend's reaction of going out each time might be her way of getting space, but if the author isn't planning and it's causing repeated arguments, maybe he should be more considerate.\n\nThe author's argument is that gaming isn't a plan, so she doesn't need to make one. But the girlfriend is feeling that her time is being affected. The answer might depend on whether the author is being dismissive of her feelings. The author isn't wrong per se, but maybe he's not seeing her perspective. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, it's possible he is not wrong because he's also entitled to his hobbies. But relationships require compromise. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, but there's room for better communication. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe he's not wrong because he's expressing his needs, but she's also within her rights to want planning. So the answer could be B.\n"
