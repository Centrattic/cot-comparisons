We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author and his girlfriend living together, and he wants to game with friends without making specific plans for her to do something else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they've been together for three years and that he used to game alone before they started living together. Now that they're in the same house, his girlfriend wants him to plan his gaming time so she can make her own plans. He argues that she doesn't need to go out each time and can just relax or use his laptop. The girlfriend seems to feel neglected when he's gaming and wants dedicated \"us time.\" The author, on the other hand, wants to have his own hobby time with friends.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. When couples live together, balancing personal time and shared time becomes crucial. The author's initial reaction was to let her know he was going to play, expecting her to be okay with it. However, the girlfriend's response indicates that she feels like she has to reciprocate with her own plans, which might not be feasible or fair. The author's dismissive attitude (\"just relax and chill on your phone\") might not acknowledge her feelings of missing out on his attention. \n\nBut the author also isn't doing anything wrong by wanting to play games; it's a personal activity. The issue is more about their expectations and how they handle the situation. The girlfriend's need for constant attention might be a bit much, but it's understandable she feels left out. The author's argument that he's not going away and they can still interact while he's gaming is valid, but maybe the way he phrased it was sarcastic (\"jokingly\" suggesting she watch him play), which could have hurt her feelings. \n\nThe problem arises from the lack of mutual understanding. The author should consider his girlfriend's perspective and try to find a middle ground, like setting aside specific times for gaming and other times for just the two of them. However, he isn't entirely in the wrong because he's also expressing his need for personal time. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are respectful of her feelings without completely sacrificing his own needs. \n\nSince the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion, I need to evaluate if the author's refusal to make plans for her is indeed a problem. The girlfriend's expectation that he preplans his gaming so she can have her own time might not be fair, but the author's approach of not considering it a \"plan\" and not making an effort to adjust could also be seen as dismissive. \n\nIn AITA discussions, the balance of respect and consideration is often key. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting his gaming time, but he could have handled the communication better. The girlfriend's reaction is also a bit extreme if she starts blaming him for her own inability to make plans. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He has a right to his hobbies, and the girlfriend's demand for preplanned alternatives might not be reasonable. The answer is B (No).\n"
