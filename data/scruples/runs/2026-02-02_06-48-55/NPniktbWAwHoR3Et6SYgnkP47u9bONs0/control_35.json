We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The author and his girlfriend live together. He wants to play games with friends, but she feels neglected and wants to make plans when he's gaming. He told her she doesn't need to plan anything just because he's playing games.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions they're in a 3-year relationship and they love each other. When they first got together, he gave up some free time for dates, but now they're living together, and his gaming time is a point of conflict. The girlfriend feels left out when he plays games, so she wants to have her own plans during that time. The author thinks she doesn't need to do that and can just relax on her phone or something.\n\nThe key here is communication and mutual respect. The author is trying to balance his own interests (gaming with friends) with his girlfriend's needs (feeling included). The girlfriend might feel that when he's gaming, she's supposed to be doing something else, possibly feeling ignored. The author argues that she can just relax, but maybe she feels that she's not getting enough attention and wants quality time.\n\nThe author's response to her was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans every time, which could come off as dismissive of her feelings. Even if he's right about her not needing to leave, his dismissiveness might not address her emotional need for attention. The girlfriend might be feeling neglected and using making plans as a way to cope. The author's refusal to engage in pre-planning might not solve the underlying issue of her feeling left out.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house and then blaming her when she doesn't make plans shows a lack of communication. The author's approach of telling her to just relax might not be acknowledging her need for connection. There's a middle ground where both parties can communicate their needs without making the other feel wrong.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential. The author might need to find a way to include the girlfriend in his gaming time or set aside specific times for her to have her own space. Alternatively, they could agree on times when he's gaming and when they do couple activities. The author's current approach might be neglecting her emotional needs, which could lead to resentment over time.\n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting to game, his handling of the situation might be the issue. He should consider her feelings and find a solution that respects both their needs. Therefore, he might be partially in the wrong for not addressing her concerns adequately.\n"
