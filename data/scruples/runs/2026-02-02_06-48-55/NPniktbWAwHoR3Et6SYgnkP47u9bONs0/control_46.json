We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend wanting them to plan their gaming time in advance so she can make her own plans, while the author thinks she doesn't need to go out every time he plays.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The couple has been together for 3 years and living together for 4 months. The author used to give up his free time for dates when they first started dating. Now that they live together, he wants to game occasionally with friends, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels neglected during those times. The author tried to explain that she can watch or use his laptop, but she left to her sister's house, leading to arguments. The author then told her she doesn't need to make plans just because he's playing.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The girlfriend feels that when the author is gaming, she's left without things to do and wants some independence. The author, on the other hand, feels like he should be able to game without her needing to plan something in response. \n\nIn relationships, especially when living together, it's important to balance personal time and shared time. The girlfriend's request to plan ahead might stem from a desire for her own space or activities. The author's initial reaction was to dismiss her feelings by suggesting she just relax or use the laptop, which might not address her emotional needs. \n\nHowever, the author also mentions that he's willing to spend time with her after gaming. The issue here is whether the girlfriend's reaction is reasonable. If she's feeling that her needs aren't met, it's valid for her to express that. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but maybe the problem is a lack of compromise. \n\nThe author's statement that she \"doesn't need to go out every time\" could be seen as dismissive of her needs. Even if she doesn't have to go out, the underlying issue is about attention and time. The author's previous habit of giving up his free time for the relationship might have set expectations that are now conflicting with his desire for personal gaming time. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's needs are valid (feeling neglected when he's gaming), then the author might have a responsibility to find a middle ground. However, if the author's gaming is a reasonable personal activity and the girlfriend is overreacting, then he might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut since the girlfriend is seeking a way to feel included or have her own space, the problem might be more about communication. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to plan might not consider her perspective. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being at least partially in the wrong for not addressing her feelings adequately. However, since the author is trying to balance his own needs, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because both parties have valid points, and the author isn't entirely wrong. The real issue is about communication and finding a compromise, not a clear right or wrong.\n"
