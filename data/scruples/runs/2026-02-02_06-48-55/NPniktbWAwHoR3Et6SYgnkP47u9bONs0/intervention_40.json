We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together three years and live together now. The girlfriend is upset when he plays games without her making plans, implying she feels neglected. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out just because he's gaming; maybe she can just relax or use his laptop. He mentions she wants constant attention, so maybe he's trying to balance his own needs with hers.\n\nThe author says he gave her advanced notice sometimes, but when she didn't make plans, she blamed him. He told her she doesn't have to go out, just chill. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be that when he's gaming, she feels she has nothing to do. The author dismisses this by suggesting she can watch him play or use his laptop, but she went to her sister's house instead.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Both partners need to feel valued and heard. The author might be in the right if he's communicating his need for personal time, especially since they live together. However, the girlfriend's feelings of neglect are valid. If she's feeling like she has to make plans every time he wants to game, maybe there's a lack of communication or balance.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings might be dismissive. He joked about her watching him play, which could be seen as not taking her feelings seriously. When she went to her sister's, that might have been her way of dealing with the situation, but it led to arguments. The author then changed his approach by telling her she doesn't need to make plans, which might help, but if she's seeking attention, maybe the solution is to find a middle ground. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points are communication and mutual respect. If he's not considering her feelings and only focusing on his own, he's in the wrong. But if they're both trying to balance their needs and there's a communication breakdown, maybe it's not solely on him. However, the girlfriend's reaction (leaving for hours) and the fact that the author didn't address her emotional needs beyond telling her to use his laptop or phone could mean he's dismissing her valid feelings. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to feel that their needs are met. The author wants to game, but the girlfriend needs attention. If he's not making time for her when she's with him, that's a problem. So maybe he is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his gaming without addressing her emotional needs, even if she's going to extremes. Alternatively, if they can't find a balance, both might have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's not making accommodations for her feelings and is dismissing her by saying she can just use her phone, maybe he's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
