We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living together where the boyfriend wants to play games, and the girlfriend feels she needs to make plans to avoid being alone. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time he plays, suggesting she can just relax or use her phone.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The girlfriend feels neglected when he plays games without prior plans. She wants to be included or have her own activities when he's busy. The author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans, which might not address her emotional needs. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house for a few hours indicates she's feeling ignored. The author's initial approach of not informing her in advance might have contributed to her feeling left out. Even when he did give notice, she felt blamed if she didn't make plans. \n\nThe author's point about wanting to game with friends is valid, but the conflict arises from not considering her feelings. The girlfriend might be seeking attention and companionship, which the author is not providing during those gaming sessions. The author's suggestion that she can just use her phone or relax might not be enough for her. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to balance their individual needs. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but he could be missing the point of her request. She wants to feel included or have structured time for herself when he's occupied. The answer depends on whether the author is dismissing her feelings or not making an effort to accommodate her, which seems to be the case here. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's not addressing her emotional needs and is dismissive of her requests for pre-planning.\n"
