We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. They live together and are in a three-year relationship. The girlfriend seems to want to be included or have plans when he's gaming, and when he doesn't involve her, she goes to her sister's house or gets upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author wants time to play games with friends, which is a legitimate need for relaxation and social interaction. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel neglected or not included because when he plays, she's left without plans. It's important to consider communication and mutual respect in relationships.\n\nThe author mentioned that the girlfriend wants \"constant attention,\" which might imply she's not just seeking plans but companionship. However, the author's point is that gaming isn't a plan that requires her to leave; she can relax with him. The conflict arises from differing expectations of how time should be spent together or apart.\n\nIn relationships, it's normal for partners to have different needs for alone time and social activities. The key is communication and compromise. The author tried to communicate that she doesn't need to leave every time he games. But the girlfriend feels that her time is being overlooked. It's possible that the author didn't fully anticipate how his actions might affect her, but he's also trying to maintain his own hobbies.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might indicate she feels ignored. However, the author is also trying to balance his own needs. It's a common situation where both partners need to find a middle ground. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's asserting his need for personal time, but there's room for better communication. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether both could adjust. Since he's defending his right to game without her feeling the need to leave, and she's overreacting by leaving each time, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
