We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together three years and living together for four months. The author wants to game with friends, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels neglected when he plays. She wants him to plan his gaming so she can make her own plans. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time and can just relax.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue is about communication and expectations. The girlfriend feels that when he's gaming, she's left without things to do. She wants to have her own plans during that time. The author thinks she's overreacting and that she can just do something else like watch him play or use the laptop. \n\nI need to consider if the author is being inconsiderate. When they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his time for the relationship. Now that they live together, he's trying to balance his personal time with her expectations. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling like her needs aren't being met. She's asking for plans to be made in advance so she can have her own time, which is a reasonable request. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing his need for personal time with friends. He's not wrong in wanting that, but the way he's handling it might be the problem. By not considering her feelings and dismissing her requests (like saying she can just watch him play), he might be contributing to her feeling left out. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The author could be in the wrong if he's not making an effort to accommodate her feelings. However, the girlfriend's expectation that he has to plan every gaming session so she can have her own plans might also be unrealistic. The balance between personal time and couple time is important. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the author is willing to communicate better and find a middle ground. If he's only focusing on his own needs without considering hers, he might be the asshole. But if he's trying to explain his position and she's not being reasonable, maybe not. \n\nIn the end, the author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans could be seen as dismissive. He should probably acknowledge her feelings and find a compromise. So, maybe he's not entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement. However, the AITA format usually sides with the person who is more inconsiderate. Since the girlfriend is feeling neglected and he's not addressing her needs adequately, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because both have valid points, but he's expressing his needs too. Wait, but maybe the girlfriend's request is reasonable. If he's playing games, she's left to do nothing. He should plan ahead so she can have her own time. If he doesn't plan, she's stuck. So, if the author isn't planning and she's expecting him to, then he's in the wrong. But he argues she doesn't need to go out. Hmm. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because both have valid needs, but the author is expressing his, and the girlfriend might be overreacting. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid, then the author isn't considering her enough. Maybe the answer is A. Hmm. I need to decide. The key points: living together, he's trying to have his time, she wants her time. If he's not considering her feelings and just wants to play, maybe he's in the wrong. But if he's trying to explain his position, maybe not. The answer is probably B, but I'm not sure. Let me check similar AITA posts. Usually, if someone is neglecting their partner's feelings for their own interests, they are considered the asshole. So if the author isn't making an effort to include her or communicate properly, he's in the wrong. But he did mention he's willing to talk while he plays. Maybe he's not entirely wrong. The correct answer is B.\n"
