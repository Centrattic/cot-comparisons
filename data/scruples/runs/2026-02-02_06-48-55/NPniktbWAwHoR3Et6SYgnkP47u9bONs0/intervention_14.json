We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author and his girlfriend living together, and she's upset when he plays video games without making plans for her to do something else during that time.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and his girlfriend have been together for three years and living together for four months. When they first started dating, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, but now they live together and spend more time together. The issue arose when he wanted to play Apex Legends with a friend, and his girlfriend was upset because she felt she had nothing to do during that time. He tried to reassure her that she could watch him play or just relax, but she went to her sister's house, and he proceeded to play. This led to arguments where she wanted him to plan ahead so she could make her own plans, but he told her she didn't need to go out and could just relax.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious. The options are A for Yes (author is wrong) or B for No (author is not wrong). \n\nFrom the description, the key points are: the girlfriend feels neglected when he plays games without planning for her to have something to do. The author initially thought she was kidding when she said that. He later told her she doesn't need to make plans just because he's gaming. She wants constant attention but he wants to game online. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, communication is key. The girlfriend is expressing her feelings of loneliness when he's gaming. The author, on the other hand, is trying to balance his own need for leisure activities. However, by dismissing her feelings and suggesting she just relax on her phone or use the laptop might not be addressing her emotional needs. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her needs for companionship are being ignored. The author's response of not requiring her to make plans every time might not take into account her desire for engagement. Even if she's not going out, she might want his attention. The fact that she went to her sister's house could indicate she felt upset and needed space, which the author didn't fully acknowledge. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's needs. If the author wants to play games, he should consider how his actions affect his partner. Just because it's not a \"plan\" doesn't mean her feelings aren't valid. The author might be in the wrong for not being more empathetic and for not finding a middle ground that satisfies both their needs. \n\nHowever, the author is also trying to maintain his hobbies, which is reasonable. The conflict here is about balancing personal time with the partner's emotional needs. The girlfriend's reaction might be excessive if she's holding him responsible for her activities, but her feelings of neglect are real. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing her feelings adequately and not making an effort to find a compromise. However, there's nuance here. The answer depends on whether the author should adjust his behavior to accommodate his girlfriend's emotional needs rather than dismissing them. Since the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author's response was dismissive, the answer might lean towards A. But there's a balance between personal hobbies and partner's feelings.\n"
