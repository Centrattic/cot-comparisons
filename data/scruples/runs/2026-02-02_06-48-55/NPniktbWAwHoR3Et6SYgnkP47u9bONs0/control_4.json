We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their girlfriend live together. The author wants to play video games sometimes, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels she has to make plans every time he wants to game. The author argues that she doesn't need to go out every time and can just relax or use his laptop instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that they've been together for three years and that the girlfriend is someone who wants constant attention. However, he also wants to play games with friends. The girlfriend feels that when he's gaming, she's left with nothing to do and wants to have something planned to do on her own. She goes to her sister's house when this happens. The author tells her she doesn't need to make plans and can just relax on her phone or use his laptop. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's point of view, maybe she feels neglected or that her needs for attention aren't being met. She might be trying to balance her own needs for social interaction or downtime. If she goes to her sister's house, perhaps she's trying to get some space or social time, but the author is not respecting that by expecting her to stay home and just watch him play. \n\nThe author's perspective is that she doesn't have to make plans every time he plays games. He's saying she can just relax or use his laptop. But maybe the issue is that the girlfriend feels like she's missing out on her own social time, and the author isn't acknowledging that. The author's response of \"just relax on your phone\" might not be enough for her if she truly needs more active engagement or socializing.\n\nI should also think about communication. The author tried to explain that gaming isn't a plan and that they can have time together later. However, the girlfriend might feel that even when he's gaming, she's not being included enough. The author's suggestion that she can just use his laptop might not be a valid solution if she prefers to go out for her downtime. \n\nAnother angle is the transition from living separately to living together. When they lived apart, the author had his own game time and she had her own time. Now, living together might mean their schedules are overlapping more, which could lead to conflicts. The girlfriend might be adjusting to this new dynamic by trying to create some independence for herself, which is a reasonable thing to want. \n\nThe author's insistence that she doesn't need to make plans every time could be seen as dismissing her needs. Even if she's not going out every time, the fact that she feels she needs to make plans to have something to do shows that she's not okay just staying home. The author's solution of using the laptop or phone might not address her deeper need for social interaction or personal space.\n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships require balance. If the author is using his time to game with friends, the girlfriend might feel that she's not getting enough quality time or social interaction. The author might be prioritizing his own time, which is okay, but he should consider how that affects his partner. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he has a right to his own hobbies and downtime. However, the way he's dismissing the girlfriend's need to make plans and not validating her feelings could be problematic. The key issue is communication and finding a middle ground where both their needs are met. The author's response to tell her she can just relax on her phone might be a sign of not understanding her perspective, which is a problem. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's not adequately addressing her emotional needs and social requirements, even if his own need for gaming is valid.\n"
