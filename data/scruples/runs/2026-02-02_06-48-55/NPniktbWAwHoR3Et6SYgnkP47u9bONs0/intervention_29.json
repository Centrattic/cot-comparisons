We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's girlfriend expecting them to make plans every time he wants to game, and he's telling her she doesn't need to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. They live together and have been together for three years. The author used to give up free time for dates, but now with living together, there's a conflict. The girlfriend feels left out when he plays games, expecting him to plan activities so she can do something else. The author, on the other hand, feels it's not a \"plan\" and that she can just relax or use his laptop.\n\nThe key points to consider are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend is expressing her feelings of being neglected when he plays games. The author's response of \"she doesn't need to go out\" might dismiss her emotional needs. Even if he wants to play games, it's important to acknowledge her feelings and find a compromise. The girlfriend might need more attention, and the author's insistence on just playing games without considering her feelings could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions she's the kind of girl who wants constant attention. That might mean her needs are higher in a relationship. If he's aware of that, he should make an effort to balance his gaming with her needs. Telling her she doesn't need to make plans could be the wrong approach because it undermines her feelings of not wanting to be alone. Instead, maybe he could find ways to include her in his gaming, like letting her watch or join if possible, or set specific times when gaming is a solo activity and others when they can be together.\n\nOn the flip side, the author is also trying to maintain his interests and social connections, which is important in a relationship. But the way he's handling it seems to not take her feelings into account. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house might be a sign that she's not being heard, and the author's dismissive attitude could be contributing to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's need for attention and the author's response, it seems like he might be in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not addressing her emotional needs and is dismissing her feelings, even if his intention is to have his own time. A healthy relationship requires both partners to communicate and find a balance between their individual needs and the relationship's needs.\n"
