We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author and his girlfriend living together. He wants to play games sometimes, and she's upset because she feels she needs to make plans every time he wants to game. She wants him to preplan so she can go out and have things to do, but he says she doesn't need to go out just because he's playing games.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that when they first dated, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates, but now that they live together, he's trying to balance his own interests. He's trying to play games with friends, which is a common activity for many people. However, his girlfriend is feeling left out or not getting enough attention, so she wants to have her own plans when he's gaming. She went to her sister's house a few times, which might indicate she's seeking social interaction or a break. \n\nThe author's response was to tell her she doesn't need to make plans every time he gamed and to just relax. But his girlfriend might feel that he's not considering her feelings. The key issue here is communication and mutual respect. When you live with someone, it's important to balance personal time and shared time. The author wants to maintain his hobbies, which is understandable, but his girlfriend might need some independence or activities outside the house.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's asserting his right to have his own time, which is valid. However, maybe he should have been more proactive in discussing how to balance their needs. If he's expecting her to \"chill\" or use her phone, maybe he isn't considering her need for social interaction or personal time. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because he's expressing his need to have downtime, but he could be more empathetic towards her feelings. \n\nOn the flip side, his girlfriend's reaction might be a bit extreme, but she's also trying to communicate her needs. The fact that she left a few times and blamed him when she didn't make plans might indicate she's not communicating effectively either. The problem here is a lack of mutual understanding. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to find a middle ground. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to play games, but maybe he could be more considerate by checking in with her about how she feels when he's gaming. However, the girlfriend's requirement to make plans every time might be too much. The author's stance that she doesn't need to go out every time seems reasonable because sometimes people just want to relax without making formal plans. \n\nOverall, it's a bit of a gray area, but since the author is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he's standing up for his own needs and suggesting that his girlfriend doesn't have to make plans, which is valid. However, both could benefit from better communication. But based on the question, the answer is likely B.\n"
