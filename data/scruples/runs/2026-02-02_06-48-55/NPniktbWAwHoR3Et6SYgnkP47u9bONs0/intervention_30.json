We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she doesn't need to make plans every time he wants to game. The situation involves them living together for four months, being in a three-year relationship. The main issue is the girlfriend expecting plans to be made when he wants to play games, so she can have something to do, while the author thinks she doesn't need to go out just because he's gaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that when they first got together, he gave up a lot of his free time for dates and couple things. Now that they live together, he wants to play games with friends, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels left out when he's gaming. She wants to make plans to do something else, but the author is telling her she doesn't have to. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend might feel neglected when he's gaming without her doing something else, maybe because she's used to spending time together or she wants more attention. The author, on the other hand, is trying to maintain his own hobbies and social time. \n\nThe author says he told her she can watch him play, but she didn't want to. Then he gave her the option to relax or use his laptop, but she still went to her sister's house. The argument is that she's making plans to go out every time he wants to game, which he finds unnecessary. \n\nFrom a relationship advice perspective, the issue might be about balancing personal time versus couple time. The author might be in the right if he's communicating his needs and setting boundaries, but the girlfriend's feelings about feeling left out are valid. However, the author's response might be dismissive of her needs. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's not respecting her feelings by insisting she doesn't need to make plans, even if she feels the need to do so, that could be an issue. On the flip side, she might need to understand that he has his own interests. \n\nBut the author's solution of letting her use his laptop or phone might not address her emotional need for connection. She might want to spend time together or do something else rather than just being in the same room. The fact that she went to her sister's house shows she's avoiding the situation, which could indicate deeper issues. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might be at fault. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to game, but he might be in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings and not finding a compromise. If he's dismissing her requests without understanding her perspective, that's a problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's not fully addressing her emotional needs by telling her she doesn't need to make plans, even if she feels the need to do something to occupy her time. Healthy relationships require compromise and understanding both partners' needs.\n"
