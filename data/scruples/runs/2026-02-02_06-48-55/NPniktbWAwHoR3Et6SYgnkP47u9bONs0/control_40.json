We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy and his girlfriend live together. They've been together for three years, and he used to play games when they were apart. Now that they live together, he wants to game, but his girlfriend is upset because she feels like she has to make plans every time he wants to play. She wants him to let her know in advance so she can have her own time. The guy is saying she doesn't need to leave every time, just relax.\n\nHmm, first, communication seems important here. The girlfriend is expressing that she feels neglected when he plays. Even if he's just gaming, she might need some personal space or activities of her own. But the guy is also using his free time to do something he enjoys. The problem arises because she's expecting him to preplan so she can make her own plans. \n\nWait, but she's reacting by going to her sister's house, which might indicate she's feeling lonely during his gaming time. The guy says she's the type who wants constant attention. So maybe he's not giving her enough attention when she wants it. But he's also entitled to his hobbies. However, living together means balancing personal time with couple time. \n\nIf he's using gaming as a way to disconnect when they're already living together, that might not be fair. Maybe he should consider her feelings. She's asking him to plan ahead so she can have her own time, which is reasonable. If he's saying she doesn't have to leave but just relax, maybe she's not comfortable with that and needs more space than just sitting nearby. \n\nBut then, the guy might feel like he's being asked to make every gaming session a planned event, which could be restrictive. The key here is mutual respect and compromise. If he's not considering her needs by just expecting her to relax nearby when she's used to having his attention, then he might be in the wrong. On the other hand, if she's expecting him to always prioritize her plans, that could be unreasonable. \n\nWait, the girlfriend's main issue is that when he plays, she has nothing to do. So maybe she's not against him gaming, but she wants some time to herself. The author's response of telling her she doesn't need to make plans every time could be dismissive of her need for personal space. If he's not allowing her to have that space without making plans, perhaps that's the problem. Alternatively, maybe she's using the need for plans as a way to get him to spend time with her. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to find a balance. The author might not be in the wrong if he's asserting his right to personal time, but if his gaming is causing her distress without compromise, then maybe he is. The fact that she's going to her sister's house shows she's unhappy, and he's not addressing her emotional needs. So, maybe the answer is that he's in the wrong because he's not considering her feelings and needs, not just his own. He should communicate and find a middle ground instead of dismissing her request for preplanning.\n"
