We\u2019ve been together for 3 years, and I\u2019ve loved every minute of it and we absolutely adore each other.\n\nWhen we first got together I gave up a lot of my free time for dates and other couple things like that. \n\nWe would spend the night together sometimes. But when we would go home alone, to our respective houses. I would use that time to get my game time in.\n\nNow flash forward, we live together and are obviously spending more time together. \n\nIt all started a few weeks ago after work, when my buddy messaged me and asked me to get on and play Apex Legends, I say yeah, and tell my girlfriend I\u2019m gonna play some games if she doesn\u2019t mind. Up until that point we only used my Xbox as an entertainment system ( think Hulu, YouTube and Netflix.) \n\nI had previously taken a pretty long break from games and I didn\u2019t expect this to be her reaction.\n\nShe said, it\u2019s not fair for me to play games because she has nothing else to do while we play. I said, well you can watch me play jokingly, I thought she was kidding at first, but then she continued and said if I wanna make plans then to let her know so she can be busy while I\u2019m busy. She also said she missed me. I told her we could have time for just us when I was done playing, and that it wasn\u2019t a \u201cplan.\u201d I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019ll be right here. I even told her we could talk while I played. But she didn\u2019t want to have any of it. She just went to her sisters house for a few hours, and I proceeded to get some dubs.\n\nThen, it became an argument we had 2-3 times. I even gave her advanced notice on an occasion or two but If she failed to make her plan she blamed it on me. So I told her \u2018she didn\u2019t need to go out every time, I\u2019m busy. Just relax and chill on your phone or use my laptop.\u2019 \n\nShe\u2019s the kinda girl who wants constant attention and I am fine with that, but I also want to chill with my friends online and play. \n\nAITA?\n\nTl;dr Girlfriend wants me to preplan my gaming time so she can make plans to go out. I said she doesn\u2019t need to go out just because I wanna play games.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to play video games and the girlfriend expecting them to make plans whenever he wants to game. The author argues that the girlfriend is trying to go out every time, but he's okay with her just relaxing. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The couple has been together for three years and has been living together for four months. The author used to spend time alone gaming when they lived apart, but now that they're together, the girlfriend feels left out when he plays. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding.\n\nThe author mentions that he jokingly suggested she watch him play, but she took it seriously and wanted him to make plans so she could have something to do. When he tells her not to make plans every time, the argument escalates. The girlfriend's reaction of going to her sister's house for hours shows she's hurt or upset. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their needs. The author wants his gaming time, which is a personal hobby, but the girlfriend might feel neglected. The author's response of telling her she can just relax on her phone or use the laptop might not address her emotional need for connection. \n\nThe girlfriend wanting \"constant attention\" as the author puts it, might be a red flag, but it's also possible she's adjusting to cohabitation. Living together can change dynamics, and the author might need to balance his gaming time with quality time. However, the author is also asserting his right to personal time, which is valid. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not accommodating her request to pre-plan. If the girlfriend feels that her needs aren't being met because he's gaming without considering her, then the author might be in the wrong for not finding a middle ground. However, if the girlfriend is overreacting and the author is just trying to maintain his hobbies, then he might not be at fault. \n\nThe key here is communication. The author should have discussed his gaming habits with her before moving in together to set expectations. Now that they're living together, both need to negotiate their time. The author's dismissive attitude (\"just relax on your phone\") might be part of the problem, but the girlfriend's need to go out every time is also excessive. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential. The author isn't entirely wrong for wanting his space, but he's not considering her feelings adequately. He might need to find a balance, like setting specific gaming times or engaging in activities they can both enjoy. The girlfriend's reaction is valid if she feels neglected, but her solution (leaving for hours) might not be helpful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is partially at fault for not addressing her feelings and not finding a compromise. But the girlfriend's approach could also be improved. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), because he's not fully considering her perspective and is being dismissive. But there's nuance here. The AITA subreddit often looks at intention and impact. The author's intention was to game, but the impact on his partner was significant. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
