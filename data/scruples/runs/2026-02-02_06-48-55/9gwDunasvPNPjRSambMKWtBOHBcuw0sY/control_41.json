      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the girlfriend should be doing all the cooking and cleaning because the man pays more for rent and utilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for 8 years and live together. The man owns the house, and his salary is twice her salary, so he pays more towards rent and utilities. The arrangement was that she does the cooking and cleaning. But now she's getting irritable about the chores. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework because he pays more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness in domestic responsibilities. The man's argument is based on financial contribution\u2014since he pays more, she should handle more chores. But chores aren't always directly tied to money. Relationships often involve shared responsibilities regardless of financial contributions. Even if one partner earns more, it's generally considered fair to split chores unless both agree otherwise. \n\nThe initial arrangement worked for two years, but now there's tension. The problem might be that the man is not contributing to chores, even though he pays more. Financial contributions don't necessarily mean he should be exempt from other responsibilities. If she's irritable, maybe the workload is too much for her, and he's not stepping in. \n\nAlso, the fact that he owns the house might make him feel more entitled to have things his way, but that's not necessarily fair. The girlfriend's feelings and well-being are important. Maybe the man is assuming that because he covers more financial costs, he shouldn't have to do chores. But in a healthy relationship, both should contribute in ways that are balanced for them. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A, he's in the wrong. Because expecting her to do all chores just because he pays more isn't fair. Both should share responsibilities unless they mutually agree on a different arrangement. The fact that she's getting irritable suggests the current setup isn't working, and he might not be considering her feelings or workload.\n"
