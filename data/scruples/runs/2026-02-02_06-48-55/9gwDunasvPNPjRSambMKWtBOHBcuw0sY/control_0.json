      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years and live together. He owns the house, and his salary is about twice hers, so he pays more rent and utilities. The girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework since he pays more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both people living together usually expect an equitable division of labor. The author's reasoning is that because he pays more, she should do more chores. But housework isn't just about money\u2014it's about mutual respect and willingness to contribute. Even if one person earns more, household responsibilities often require teamwork. \n\nThe fact that she's been irritable lately suggests that she might feel overburdened or taken advantage of. The author might be assuming that financial contribution equals labor contribution, but that's not necessarily how relationships work. Partners usually contribute in different ways, and expecting someone to do more chores just because you pay more could lead to resentment. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they've been together for 8 years. Over such a long time, expectations might have changed. Maybe the initial arrangement was fair two years ago, but now it's causing tension. The key issue here is communication. The author should discuss with his girlfriend to understand her feelings and find a new balance that works for both. \n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, the author is not considering that housework is a shared responsibility regardless of financial contributions. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not adjusting the arrangement and for expecting her to take on more without considering her feelings.\n"
