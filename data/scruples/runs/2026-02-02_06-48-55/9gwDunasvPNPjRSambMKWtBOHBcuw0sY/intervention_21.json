      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. \n\nFirst, the setup: they've been together 8 years, live together, and the author owns the house. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more rent and utilities. In exchange, she does cooking and cleaning. That's worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable. The author wonders if he's in the wrong for thinking she should do more since he pays more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and expectations in a relationship. The author's reasoning is that because he pays more, she should contribute more with chores. But is that a fair assumption?\n\nI remember that in relationships, fairness isn't always about splitting things proportionally to income. Emotional labor and how people feel about their contributions matter a lot. Even if someone pays more, chores aren't always a direct trade-off. Maybe the girlfriend feels the workload is uneven even though she's doing cooking and cleaning. Or maybe she's taking on more emotional labor beyond just the visible chores.\n\nAlso, the fact that the house is solely in the author's name might play a role. Does that mean he's responsible for maintenance or other costs? Maybe he's thinking that since he owns the place, it's his responsibility to some extent, but he's already balancing it by paying more in rent/utilities. However, if the chores have increased or her tolerance has decreased, that could be an issue.\n\nAnother angle is communication. If the author hasn't discussed this with her and instead is just assuming she should do more based on his payment, that's a problem. Relationships require open communication about needs and expectations. Maybe the girlfriend's irritability is a sign that the current arrangement isn't working for her anymore, and the author isn't considering her perspective.\n\nAlso, the initial agreement might have been fair two years ago, but circumstances change. Maybe the workload has increased, or her personal situation has changed. The author's approach seems to be based on a fixed ratio (payment = chores), but relationships need flexibility. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might think that splitting chores is a shared responsibility regardless of who pays more. But others might argue that the person contributing more financially should take on more chores. However, the key is mutual agreement and feeling valued. If the girlfriend feels overburdened, even if the chores are as agreed, it's a sign that the arrangement needs to be reevaluated.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not considering his girlfriend's current feelings and the dynamic of their relationship. He's making an assumption based on financial contribution rather than discussing their current needs and perhaps not adjusting the chores as things change. The fact that she's been irritable suggests that the current setup isn't working for her, and he should address that through communication instead of insisting on the old arrangement.\n"
