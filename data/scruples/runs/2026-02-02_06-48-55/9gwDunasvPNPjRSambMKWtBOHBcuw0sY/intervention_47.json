      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house and pays more because his salary is higher. The girlfriend does the chores, which worked for two years but now she's getting irritable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is suggesting that because he pays more, she should do more chores. But is that fair? Financial contributions are one aspect of shared living, but household responsibilities can also be about fairness in the relationship. \n\nThe key question is whether the current arrangement is equitable. The girlfriend might feel that even though he pays more, she's doing a disproportionate amount of the housework. Maybe she expects a more balanced division of labor regardless of finances. People often value emotional labor and physical chores as part of a healthy relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that the house is in his name might add some pressure on him to provide, but that doesn't necessarily mean the chores should be split based on financial input. Relationships are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since he contributes more financially, she should handle more chores. But this could be a flawed assumption. The girlfriend might feel that her contributions are equally important, and maybe she's taking on more than just cooking and cleaning, like emotional support or other tasks. \n\nIt's possible that the author isn't considering her perspective. Communication is key here. If he's expecting her to do more without discussing her feelings, that's problematic. The irritation suggests she's unhappy, so maybe the current arrangement isn't working for her anymore. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that splitting chores based on income is a way to balance the household, but others see it as outdated or unfair. Modern relationships often emphasize equality regardless of financial contributions. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings and if the division of chores isn't agreed upon by both parties. The problem isn't just the chores but the expectation tied to financial contributions. Relationships require negotiation and understanding both partners' needs and limits.\n"
