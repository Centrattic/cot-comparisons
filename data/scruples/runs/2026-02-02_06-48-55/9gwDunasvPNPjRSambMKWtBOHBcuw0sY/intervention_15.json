      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The setup is that they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, his salary is double hers, so he pays more rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. This worked for two years, but now she's irritable about the chores. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for thinking she should do more since he pays more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The key points here are financial contributions versus domestic labor. The man is paying more for rent and utilities, which is significant, but the assumption is that his higher financial input justifies her doing more chores. However, relationships often require a balance of contributions beyond just money. \n\nIn many relationships, especially long-term ones, equitable distribution of responsibilities is important. Even if one person pays more financially, emotional labor and household chores are also part of the partnership. The fact that she's been doing cooking and cleaning as part of the arrangement suggests there was an unspoken or agreed-upon division. But now she's feeling irritable, which indicates that the current division might be causing her stress or she feels overburdened.\n\nThe question is whether expecting her to do more because he pays more is fair. There's an assumption here that financial contribution should directly correlate with domestic duties. However, relationships aren't always about a direct exchange. It's possible that she's taking on more emotional labor, or maybe the chores have increased beyond what she initially agreed to. Also, the length of the relationship (8 years) might mean that their needs or expectations have changed over time. \n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. Since he owns the house and pays more, he might hold more financial power in the relationship. It's important to consider if the chores are being distributed in a way that's fair, not just based on who pays what. Maybe she's doing more than just cooking and cleaning now, or perhaps the tasks are more time-consuming than he realizes. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that because he contributes more financially, she should do more chores. But in many relationships, the ideal is shared responsibilities regardless of financial input. Even if one person earns more, splitting chores equally or adjusting based on each person's capacity for labor is common. However, if both parties are okay with the arrangement, it's not necessarily wrong. But since she's now irritable, it suggests the arrangement isn't working anymore. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong initially, but the situation has changed. The key is whether they've had a discussion about their expectations. If he's expecting her to do more without considering her current capacity or stress levels, that could be the issue. Maybe she's taking on more than she can handle, or perhaps the chores have become a point of contention. The fact that he's asking if he's in the wrong implies he's aware that his reasoning might be flawed. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's increasingly common to advocate for an equal split of household chores, regardless of income. So even if he pays more, expecting her to do all the cooking and cleaning might be seen as placing an unfair burden on her. The fact that she's been doing it for two years might have led to her feeling it's her responsibility, but if the workload has increased or her capacity has decreased, it's not unreasonable for her to push back. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's assuming that his financial contribution entitles him to less domestic labor, which could be an unequal distribution of household responsibilities. The problem arises when the arrangement isn't mutually agreeable, especially since she's now expressing dissatisfaction. The author should consider renegotiating the division of chores to ensure both parties are comfortable, rather than expecting her to maintain the current arrangement despite her protests.\n"
