      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning based on him paying more of the rent and utilities. So the setup is they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, his salary is double hers. He pays more rent/utilities, so she does more chores. Now she's getting irritable, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. First, financial contributions vs. household responsibilities. The author's argument is that since he contributes more financially, she should do more chores. But is that a fair or valid expectation?\n\nI think this depends a lot on the couple's agreement and mutual expectations. If they had an unspoken agreement where she does chores in exchange for him covering more of the bills, then maybe he's not wrong. But if that's not the case, or if the arrangement has shifted, then maybe he is. Also, traditional gender roles might come into play here. The author is male, the girlfriend is female, and the chores in question are typically seen as domestic tasks often expected of women. So there might be an underlying assumption that she should handle those tasks regardless of financial contributions.\n\nBut the key point is whether the expectation is fair. Just because someone pays more doesn't necessarily mean the other person has to do all the chores. Relationships should ideally be about mutual respect and shared responsibilities, not a transactional exchange. If the author is expecting her to do all the chores just because he pays more, that could be seen as unfair, especially if she's contributing in other ways or if the workload is becoming too much for her. The fact that she's getting irritable suggests the arrangement isn't working anymore. The author might not be considering her feelings or the balance of their relationship.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author isn't contributing enough in other ways. If he's not doing any chores, even if he pays more, that's a problem. The idea that financial contribution equals chore contribution is a bit transactional and might not account for other forms of support or the emotional labor involved in managing household tasks. Also, the length of their relationship (8 years) implies that maybe the dynamics have changed over time, and what worked two years ago might not be sustainable now.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not recognizing that household responsibilities should be shared equitably, not based on financial input. The fact that she's becoming irritable shows that the current arrangement is causing stress, and he should be more flexible and communicative rather than sticking to his original expectation without considering her feelings.\n"
