      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do more chores because he pays more rent. So first, let's look at the situation.\n\nThe couple has been together for 8 years and shares a house. The author owns the house and pays more in rent/utilities because his salary is twice hers. For the past two years, she's been handling cooking and cleaning, which has worked. Now she's irritable, and the author wonders if it's his fault for expecting her to do more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and expectations in a relationship. The author is assuming that since he contributes more financially, she should contribute more with chores. But maybe there's an imbalance in how chores are divided. Even if he pays more, housework isn't necessarily proportional to income or financial contribution. Relationships often require mutual agreement on responsibilities, not just splitting based on who pays what.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests she's feeling overburdened. The author might be overlooking her feelings or not considering that her contributions might be affecting her stress levels. Maybe the chores aren't all she's doing, or maybe she feels the workload is unfair in other ways. The fact that it's been okay for two years but now she's getting irritable might indicate that things have changed, and the author hasn't adjusted accordingly.\n\nAnother angle is that the author expects her to do more because he pays more, but in many relationships, people split chores equally or based on what each person can do, not strictly on financial input. Financial contributions can be separate from domestic responsibilities. So if the author is using his higher financial contribution as a reason to assign more chores, that might be seen as unfair or transactional, which could be harmful to the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend might feel that her contributions (cooking and cleaning) are not being appreciated or that she's doing more than a fair share, especially if the author isn't helping with other tasks. It's possible that the author isn't considering her perspective and is being rigid in his expectations. The fact that the situation has only recently become an issue might mean that the workload has increased or that she's feeling more stressed about other things, and the author hasn't been communicative about his expectations.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might be in the wrong if he's not willing to adapt or if he's not considering her feelings. Relationships require communication and flexibility. If he's expecting her to do more without discussing it and without offering to help, that could be the problem. The initial arrangement worked for two years, but now it's causing tension, suggesting that a reevaluation is needed. The author's approach might be transactional, which can lead to resentment on both sides.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong if he's not being empathetic to her feelings and if he's rigidly applying a system where chores are based on financial contributions without considering other factors like time, effort, and mutual well-being. The answer is likely A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
