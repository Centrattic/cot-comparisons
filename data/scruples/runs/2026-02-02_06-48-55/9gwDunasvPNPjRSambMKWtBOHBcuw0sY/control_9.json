      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning based on their financial contributions. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. They've been together 8 years, live together, and the house is in the author's name. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more rent and utilities. In return, she handles cooking and cleaning. That's been working for two years, but now she's irritable about the chores.\n\nThe core issue here is the expectation of chores based on financial contributions. The author is thinking she should do more because he pays more. But wait, is that a fair assumption? Relationships often require mutual understanding and communication. Just because he pays more doesn't automatically mean she should take on more chores. Maybe they need to discuss their expectations instead of assuming based on money.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's becoming irritable suggests she might feel overburdened or unappreciated. Maybe the division of chores isn't right for her anymore. The author might not be considering her feelings or if the workload is balanced for both. It's possible he's taking her contributions for granted, thinking financial contribution alone justifies more chores.\n\nAnother angle: in many relationships, chores aren't divided strictly by income. Shared responsibility is key. If he's not contributing to chores beyond paying rent, that's a problem. Even if he pays more, doing some chores himself could lighten her load. Plus, the fact that the house is in his name might add pressure, but that's separate from chore division.\n\nSo, the author's approach might be flawed because he's using financial contributions as a basis for chore division without considering her feelings or the actual balance of work. He should communicate with her to find a fair system rather than expecting her to do more because he pays more. The answer would be A (yes, he's wrong) because he's assuming she should do more without considering her perspective or the health of their relationship.\n"
