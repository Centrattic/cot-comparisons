      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. From the provided scenario, the couple has been together for 8 years, live together, and the author owns the house. The author's salary is twice that of the girlfriend, so he pays more towards rent and utilities. In return, she handles the cooking and cleaning. However, recently she's been getting irritable, and the author is wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They live together, so household responsibilities are shared. The financial contribution from the author is higher, and he uses that as a basis for expecting her to take on more chores. But is that fair? The question is whether this expectation is justified or if it's an unfair assumption.\n\nOne perspective is that in a healthy relationship, responsibilities should be shared based on mutual agreement and what works best for both parties. If the arrangement was working for two years, maybe there's a shift now. The author might not be wrong in thinking that since he contributes more financially, he can expect more in terms of domestic duties. But that line of thinking can be problematic because it implies that financial contributions equate to a right to more domestic labor, which isn't necessarily a fair or modern approach. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The girlfriend's irritability might indicate that the current arrangement isn't satisfactory. If the author hasn't discussed this shift in her feelings, he might be assuming she should just continue without addressing her needs. The key here is whether the expectations were mutually agreed upon or if it's an unspoken assumption based on financial contributions. \n\nAlso, considering that the author owns the house, maybe he has more of a stake in maintaining it, but that doesn't necessarily mean the domestic duties should fall disproportionately on the other person. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong if the arrangement was previously agreed and both parties were content, but if the girlfriend is now unhappy and the author is expecting her to do more without considering her feelings, that could be an issue.\n\nThe concept of fairness here is subjective. Some people might believe that financial contributions and domestic labor should be balanced, while others argue that emotional labor and chores should be shared equitably regardless of financial inputs. The author's assumption that higher financial contributions justify more chores from the other person could be seen as outdated or unfair, especially if it's leading to resentment.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong if the initial agreement was mutual and working, but the recent irritability suggests a communication breakdown. The key issue is whether the expectations were set through open dialogue or if the author is unilaterally deciding based on financial contributions. If the latter, then he might be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and current capacities.\n"
