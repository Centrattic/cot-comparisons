      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning based on their financial contributions.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for 8 years and live in a house owned by the author. The author earns twice as much as the girlfriend, so they pay more towards rent and utilities. In return, the girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning, which has been working for two years. Now, she's becoming irritable about the chores, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong for expecting her to do more since they pay more.\n\nI need to consider if the author's expectation is fair. Financial contribution doesn't necessarily dictate household responsibilities. Relationships often require mutual effort and communication. The author might assume that because they pay more, the girlfriend should handle more chores, but this could be an outdated or unfair assumption. It's possible that the division of labor isn't equitable from the girlfriend's perspective, leading to her irritability. The key here is whether the arrangement was mutually agreed upon and if both parties feel it's fair. Without open communication, the author's assumption might be causing the issue. So, the author could be in the wrong if they aren't considering the girlfriend's feelings and if the chores are causing her stress. The answer might be A (Yes), as the author's expectation might not be fair without considering the girlfriend's input and well-being.\n"
