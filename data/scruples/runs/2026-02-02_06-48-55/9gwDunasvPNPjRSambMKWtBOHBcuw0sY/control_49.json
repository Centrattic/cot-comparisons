      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting his girlfriend to do more cooking and cleaning because he pays more of the bills.\n\nFirst, the situation is that the couple has been together for 8 years, live in a house he owns, and he pays more because his salary is double hers. She does the cooking and cleaning. Lately, she's been irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more since he pays more.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is about fairness in domestic responsibilities. The author's reasoning is that since he contributes more financially, she should take on more chores. But is that a valid assumption?\n\nI think expectations around chores can vary a lot. In some relationships, people split chores equally regardless of income. Others might adjust based on who has more time or different skills. But here, the author is tying the amount of chores to the amount paid. That might not be fair because chores aren't a direct exchange for rent. People in relationships usually expect mutual effort, not a transactional split.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend might feel that her contribution is being undervalued. Just because she earns less doesn't mean she shouldn't contribute equally in other ways. If the author is expecting more chores from her because of his higher income, that could create resentment. The fact that she's been irritable lately suggests that the current arrangement isn't working for her, and he's not considering her feelings.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the author isn't offering to help more himself. If the workload is too much for her, they should discuss how to divide the chores more evenly, regardless of income. The idea that higher financial contribution translates to fewer chores could be a problematic dynamic. Relationships require compromise and communication, not a strict transactional model.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's assuming that his higher financial contribution justifies her doing more chores, without considering mutual effort and her feelings. The answer would likely be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
