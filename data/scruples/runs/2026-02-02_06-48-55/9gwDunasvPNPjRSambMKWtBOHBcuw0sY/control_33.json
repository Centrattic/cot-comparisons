      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they live together, he owns the house and pays more rent/utilities because his salary is double his girlfriend's. She does the cooking and cleaning, which worked well for two years, but now she's getting irritable and he's thinking she should do more housework because he pays more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The man is taking a traditional role of financial provider while she handles domestic tasks. But maybe the problem is that the division of labor isn't fair anymore. He's assuming that since he contributes more financially, she should contribute more domestically. But does that logic hold?\n\nIn many relationships, there's an unspoken agreement about how responsibilities are divided. If they had an agreement where she does chores in exchange for him covering more expenses, then he might be right. But if there's no such agreement, and she's doing more without being asked or compensated in some way, that could lead to resentment. The key point here is communication. If he expects her to do more, maybe he should talk to her about it instead of assuming she should just do it. Also, the fact that he owns the house might add to the imbalance, but that's not necessarily his fault. However, expecting her to do more without considering her input could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle is that even if you pay more, housework isn't something that can be easily divided proportionally. It's possible that the chores aren't being split in a way that feels fair to her. Maybe she's taken on too much, and he's not recognizing her effort. The irritability suggests she's unhappy with the current arrangement. \n\nSo, is he wrong? He might be because he's expecting her to do more without considering her feelings or discussing it. The fact that she's irritable indicates that the current arrangement isn't working for her. Therefore, he should address the issue by communicating and finding a balance that works for both, rather than assuming she should do more just because he pays more. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not considering her perspective and the arrangement might be unfair.\n"
