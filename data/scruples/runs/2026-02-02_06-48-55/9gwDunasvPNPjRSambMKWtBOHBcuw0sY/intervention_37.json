      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do more chores because he pays more of the rent and utilities. The situation is that they've been together for 8 years, live together, and the author owns the house. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more, and she does the cooking and cleaning. But lately, she's been irritable about chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author believes that since he contributes more financially, she should take on more chores. But is that a fair expectation? Maybe in some relationships, people split chores based on financial contributions, but that's not a one-size-fits-all approach. \n\nThe girlfriend has been doing the cooking and cleaning, which are significant tasks. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for thinking she needs to do more. The key here is whether expecting chores based on financial contribution is a valid assumption. \n\nFinancial contribution isn't the only factor in a relationship. Emotional labor, time, and personal preferences also play a role. If the author isn't contributing to chores at all, even if he pays more, it might be unfair to her. The fact that she's getting irritable suggests that the current arrangement is causing her stress or resentment. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since he pays more, she should do more chores. But maybe he should consider why she's irritable. Perhaps she feels overburdened or undervalued. If the chores have increased or if her responsibilities are more than he's contributing, that could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the length of the relationship is 8 years. Over time, expectations can shift. What worked two years ago might not be sustainable now. The author might need to have an open conversation about how the chores are divided and whether both parties feel it's fair. \n\nAnother angle: Is it fair to tie chores directly to financial contributions? If the author doesn't do any chores, even if he pays more, that could be seen as unfair. Maybe the chores should be split based on mutual agreement rather than a strict financial ratio. \n\nThe girlfriend's irritation is a sign that the current arrangement isn't working for her. The author should consider her feelings and maybe adjust the chores to a more balanced approach, regardless of financial contributions. \n\nIn many relationships, people split chores equally or based on what each person can do. The financial contribution is separate from chores. Expecting someone to do more chores just because you pay more might not be fair, especially if the chores are a significant part of daily life.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's assuming that financial contribution dictates chore distribution, which isn't necessarily fair. The focus should be on mutual contribution to household tasks rather than splitting them based on money. The girlfriend's irritation is a red flag that the current setup isn't healthy. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
