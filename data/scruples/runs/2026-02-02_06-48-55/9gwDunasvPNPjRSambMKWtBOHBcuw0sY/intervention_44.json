      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that he and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years and live together. He owns the house, pays more of the rent/utilities because his salary is twice hers, and she does the cooking and cleaning. Recently, she's been getting irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a long time, which suggests they've established certain expectations. The man points out that he pays more because of his higher income. However, the woman is now upset about the chores. The core issue is whether splitting chores based on income is fair or if it's assuming she should do more because he pays more.\n\nChores in a shared household usually depend on mutual agreement. If they had an understanding where she does the cooking and cleaning in exchange for him covering more costs, that's one thing. But if that arrangement was never discussed or if she feels overburdened, then expecting her to keep doing the same without her consent might be unfair. The fact that she's becoming irritable indicates she might be feeling taken advantage of.\n\nAnother angle: even if he pays more, splitting chores equally might be necessary for fairness. Chores aren't typically divided based on income unless both parties agree. The man might be imposing his expectations without considering her feelings or changing circumstances. The woman's irritation could mean she's working too hard and needs a more balanced division.\n\nSo, the man might be in the wrong if the arrangement isn't mutually agreed upon and if he's not considering her current stress. It's about communication and adjusting expectations rather than sticking to a fixed ratio based on income. His assumption that she should do more because he pays more could be the issue. Therefore, Answer A (he's in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
