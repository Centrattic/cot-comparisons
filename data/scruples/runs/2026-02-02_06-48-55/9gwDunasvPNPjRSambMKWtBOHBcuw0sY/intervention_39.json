      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning, given their financial contributions.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, his salary is twice hers, so he pays more towards rent/utilities. In exchange, she does cooking and cleaning. That's been working for two years, but now she's getting irritable. The author is questioning if he's wrong for thinking she should do more housework because he pays more.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the fairness of the division of labor. The author's argument is that since he contributes more financially, she should handle more chores. But is that a valid expectation? \n\nFinancial contributions don't necessarily determine the chore division. Many relationships split chores based on what each person is comfortable with or their time availability, not just money. The author might be assuming that higher financial input obligates the other person to do more, but that's not a universal standard. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests that the current arrangement is causing stress. Maybe the chores are becoming too much for her, or she feels the division is unfair. The author might not be considering her perspective here. \n\nAnother angle: the fact that he owns the house might make him feel more entitled to have things his way, but ownership doesn't equate to responsibility for chores. Plus, living together as a couple usually involves mutual effort towards household duties regardless of who owns the property.\n\nThe salary disparity could be a factor, but it's important to note that relationships are about partnership. Expecting someone to do more chores just because you earn more could be seen as unequal. It's possible the girlfriend feels that despite the financial contribution, she's taking on an unfair share of the domestic work, especially if she's also working and managing other responsibilities.\n\nHowever, if the arrangement was mutual and agreed upon, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the problem arises if the expectations have changed or if there's an imbalance that wasn't discussed. The key here is communication. The author's question is whether he's right to expect more from her because of his financial contribution, but that might not be the right approach. \n\nIn many relationships, splitting chores is about fairness and what each partner can manage, not just financial input. If the girlfriend is now struggling, the author needs to consider her feelings and find a balanced approach, perhaps adjusting the division of chores or discussing other ways to contribute. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if he's using his financial contribution as a reason to assign more chores without considering her capacity or well-being. It's about mutual respect and understanding rather than a transactional approach.\n"
