      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together for 8 years, live in a house owned by the author, with their salary being twice the girlfriend's. They pay more rent/utilities, so she does the chores. Recently, she's been irritable about the chores, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the financial contributions and the division of household labor. The author pays more because they earn more, and that's been the arrangement for two years. The girlfriend is doing the cooking and cleaning. Now, she's getting irritable, and the author is questioning if they're right to expect her to do more.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether expecting someone to handle household chores in exchange for covering more of the bills is fair. Traditionally, some people might think that higher earners should cover more expenses, but household responsibilities are often expected to be shared. However, if there's an agreement or understanding that the higher earner covers costs in exchange for the other handling chores, that might be acceptable. But maybe the girlfriend feels overburdened or the arrangement isn't balanced anymore.\n\nI should think about fairness. Even if the author pays more, does that justify expecting the girlfriend to do all the chores? Maybe she's taking on more than her fair share, especially if the workload is significant. Also, considering their eight-year relationship, maybe there's a shift in their circumstances or expectations now. The fact that she's been getting irritable suggests that the current arrangement isn't satisfying to her.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions that the arrangement has worked for two years. Now, with her being irritable, perhaps the workload has increased, or her role has expanded beyond what she's comfortable with. Or maybe she's feeling underappreciated. It's possible that the author isn't recognizing her contributions and is taking her labor for granted.\n\nAlso, the fact that the house is in the author's name and they own it might not be directly relevant, but it does indicate they have a significant financial stake. However, in a relationship, shared responsibilities are usually expected regardless of property ownership. It's about mutual respect and fairness.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the chores are a fair share of the workload. If the author is not contributing in other ways (like cooking, cleaning, or other household tasks), then expecting the girlfriend to do all of it could be seen as unfair. Especially if the author isn't doing their fair share, even if they pay more in rent. Financial contributions don't necessarily equate to equal household responsibilities.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong if the arrangement is causing the girlfriend stress and she's not getting the support she needs. The key is whether the chores are a reasonable expectation given the balance of contributions. If the author isn't helping with any chores, then yes, they're in the wrong. If they're helping but she's still overloaded, maybe there's a different issue. But based on the information given, the author is expecting her to do all the chores in exchange for covering more bills, which might not be fair. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
