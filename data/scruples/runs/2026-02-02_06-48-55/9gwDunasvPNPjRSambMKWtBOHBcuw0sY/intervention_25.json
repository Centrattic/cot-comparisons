      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. They've been together for 8 years, live together, and the author owns the house. The author's salary is double the girlfriend's, so they pay more rent/utilities. The girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their situation. Financial contributions are a big part here. The author pays more because they earn more. But does that mean the girlfriend should do all the chores? Maybe there's an assumption that because he pays more, she should handle more chores. But household responsibilities aren't necessarily tied to income. \n\nIn many relationships, chores are shared based on time availability and personal preferences rather than financial contributions. Even if one person earns more, it doesn't automatically mean they should do less housework. However, some people might negotiate chores differently based on their circumstances. But if the author is expecting their girlfriend to do all the cooking and cleaning just because they pay more, that might not be fair. \n\nThe girlfriend's irritability suggests that the current arrangement isn't working for her anymore. Maybe she feels overburdened or unappreciated. The author's perspective is that since he pays more, she should do more. But that might not take into account her feelings or the fact that she might have other responsibilities. \n\nIt's also important to consider mutual agreement. If they agreed on this arrangement initially, but now she's unhappy, the author should revisit the discussion. Maybe the workload is too much for her now. The author might not be in the wrong for expecting some help, but if the expectation is that she does all the chores, that's unfair. \n\nAnother angle: financial contributions don't always translate to equal division of labor. Many couples split chores based on what each can manage, not income. If the author is using their higher income as a reason to assign more chores to the girlfriend, that's a problem. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong if they're both contributing in different ways, but if it's an unequal split without consideration for her well-being, then maybe they are. \n\nAlso, the length of the relationship (8 years) means that expectations might have shifted over time. What worked two years ago might not now. The author needs to communicate and adjust, rather than sticking to the original arrangement. \n\nSo, putting it all together, if the author is making the girlfriend do all the chores just because he pays more, that's likely unfair. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the arrangement is unequal and not considering the girlfriend's current feelings or capacity.\n"
