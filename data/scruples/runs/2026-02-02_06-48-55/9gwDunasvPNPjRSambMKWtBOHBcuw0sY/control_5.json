      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning, given that the author owns the house and earns twice as much as her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for 8 years and live together. The author pays more towards rent and utilities because of their higher salary. In return, the girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable. The author is questioning whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework since he covers more of the costs.\n\nI should think about the fairness of the arrangement. While the author pays more, expecting the girlfriend to handle all the housework might not be fair. Housework isn't just about splitting tasks based on financial contributions; it's also about mutual respect and shared responsibilities in a relationship. The fact that she's becoming irritable suggests that the current setup is causing stress. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that higher financial contribution justifies more chores might be a traditional viewpoint that doesn't account for equality in modern relationships. It's possible that the girlfriend feels her contribution is undervalued, especially if she's working and contributing financially as well. \n\nAnother angle is communication. If the arrangement was agreed upon initially, maybe there hasn't been a discussion about her increasing workload or her feelings about it. Change in dynamics over time might require renegotiating responsibilities. \n\nI should also consider cultural factors. In some cultures, dividing chores based on income is common, but in others, equality in chores is expected regardless of income. The key here is whether both partners are comfortable with the arrangement. If the girlfriend is now uncomfortable, then the author might need to adjust.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because expecting his partner to do all the housework solely because he pays more could be seen as unequal. Relationships usually require a balance beyond just financial contributions. The fact that she's getting irritated indicates that the current setup isn't working for her, and the author's expectation might not be fair.\n"
