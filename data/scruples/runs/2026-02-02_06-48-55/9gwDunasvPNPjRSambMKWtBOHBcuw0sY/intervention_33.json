      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning, given the financial arrangement. \n\nFirst, the setup: they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more rent/utilities. She does the cooking and cleaning. That worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable about chores. The author thinks she should do more housework since he pays more.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. \n\nThe key factors here are financial contribution and the division of labor. The author is assuming that because he contributes more financially, it's fair for her to handle more chores. But is that a valid assumption? \n\nIn relationships, fairness is subjective. Some people might see splitting chores as equal regardless of income, others might think financial contribution affects it. But expecting her to do more just because he pays more could be seen as unfair. Maybe the initial arrangement was balanced, but now there's a shift in her feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that he owns the house and it's in his name might play a role. Does that mean he has ownership and thus responsibility for the house's maintenance? Not necessarily, but maybe he feels a sense of responsibility. \n\nHowever, the main issue is the expectation. If she's irritable, it might mean the current division isn't working for her anymore. The author might be sticking to an old arrangement without considering her current feelings. Maybe the workload has increased, or she feels taken advantage of. \n\nAnother angle: the author's reasoning seems to link financial input directly to chore division. But in many relationships, chores are split equally or based on what each person can do, not necessarily tied to income. So if he expects her to do more because he pays more, that might be the problem. \n\nAlso, considering that they've been together 8 years, maybe there's an unspoken agreement that's been working until now. But if she's now uncomfortable and he's still expecting the same, he might not be adapting to her needs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not willing to adjust the chores despite her being irritable, that's a problem. But if he's arguing that the current arrangement is fair based on their financial setup, others might disagree. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, chores should be discussed and mutually agreed upon. Assuming she should do more because of financial reasons could be seen as unequal expectations. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not being flexible and considering her feelings now.\n"
