      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning based on the financial contributions.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together for 8 years, live together. The author owns the house, pays more rent/utilities, and his salary is twice the girlfriend's. In return, she does most of the cooking and cleaning. But now she's getting irritable about the chores. The author wonders if he's in the wrong for thinking she should do more since he's paying more.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. Let's break it down.\n\nFinancial contributions: He pays more, which is why he expects her to handle more chores. But is that fair? Well, in relationships, fairness isn't always about splitting things 50-50. It's about mutual agreement and what both parties are comfortable with. \n\nThe key point here is that the arrangement was working for two years but now she's getting irritable. The author is assuming that because he pays more, she should do more. But maybe she feels that the chores are now too much, especially considering other factors like work hours or personal preferences. \n\nAnother angle: The author owns the house and pays more. Does that automatically mean he's entitled to less chores? Not necessarily. Even if you pay more, household responsibilities often require cooperation. If the arrangement was agreed upon mutually and then she's now upset, maybe there's a communication issue. The author might not be considering her current feelings or workload.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's irritable suggests that the current setup isn't satisfying for her. The author might be rigid in his expectations without checking in with her. Relationships require flexibility and understanding. If he's expecting her to continue without considering her input, that could be the problem.\n\nAnother thought: The author's assumption that financial contribution directly translates to chore responsibilities might be flawed. Chores are part of maintaining a home, and expecting someone to do more just because you pay more could be seen as unfair. It's possible that she feels the chores are not being shared equitably, especially if other factors (like time, energy) are at play.\n\nIn some cultures or traditional setups, men pay more but women handle domestic tasks. However, modern relationships often emphasize equality. The key is mutual agreement. If the author is enforcing this without considering her current situation, he might be in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, maybe the initial arrangement was mutual. The problem arises because she's now irritable. So the author's expectation isn't inherently wrong, but the fact that he's sticking to it without addressing her concerns could be. The issue is more about communication and adapting rather than the original arrangement.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's mistake is assuming that his financial contribution justifies her doing more chores without checking if she's comfortable with it now. He should be open to discussing and adjusting the arrangement. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering her current feelings and the arrangement might need renegotiation.\n"
