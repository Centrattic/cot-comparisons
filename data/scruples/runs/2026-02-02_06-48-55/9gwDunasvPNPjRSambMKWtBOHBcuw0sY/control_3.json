      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to cook and clean because he pays more rent and utilities. They've been together 8 years, live together, and he owns the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They split chores based on who pays more. The author's salary is twice his girlfriend's, so he covers more of the rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. That worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable about the chores. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework because he pays more.\n\nHmm. Relationships often involve balancing contributions, but it's not just about financials. Maybe the girlfriend feels the workload is unfair. The author's assumption might be that since he pays more, she should handle more chores. But that's a common point of contention. Some people believe chores should be split equally regardless of income, while others think financial contributions should influence chores.\n\nI should think about fairness. If the author is paying more, maybe he should take on more chores to balance it out. Or maybe the girlfriend is doing more than her fair share. The key here is communication. Maybe the girlfriend feels the division isn't fair anymore. The author's expectation might be outdated if their circumstances have changed. But the original arrangement was that she does cooking and cleaning in exchange. However, if she's now unhappy, maybe the author isn't listening to her feelings and is rigid in his expectations.\n\nAnother angle: the author owns the house, which might imply a different responsibility. But that's not necessarily a reason for her to do chores. It's more about mutual agreement. The problem is that the author justifies his stance based on his financial input, but relationships require emotional and practical support beyond money. Maybe the author is not considering her perspective and is focusing too much on the financial aspect, leading to imbalance.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because expecting someone to do chores solely based on higher financial contributions without considering their feelings or the current situation can be unfair. Relationships should be about mutual respect and flexibility, not a transactional arrangement. The author might be overlooking the emotional labor and the need for a more balanced approach.\n"
