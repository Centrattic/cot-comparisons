      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend (they've been together 8 years, live together) does the cooking and cleaning, which has been working for two years. The author owns the house, pays more rent, and has a higher salary. Now the girlfriend is getting irritable about chores, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author feels they contribute more financially, so they expect more domestic work from their partner. But the girlfriend is now upset. Is it fair to equate financial contribution with domestic responsibility?\n\nHousehold responsibilities aren't just about splitting chores equally. They should be shared based on mutual agreement and what's fair for both partners. If the author is assuming that because they pay more, their partner should do all the cooking and cleaning, that might be an outdated or unfair expectation. Especially if the girlfriend feels overburdened, even if the arrangement was okay before.\n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together for 8 years but this has changed in the last 2 years suggests that maybe their needs or circumstances have changed. The author might not be considering that the girlfriend's current workload is too much, or that her irritation is a sign she needs a different arrangement. The key point is that the author is making an assumption about what the girlfriend should do based on their financial input, which could be seen as putting pressure on her without considering her feelings or current capacity.\n\nIn many relationships, contributions are both financial and domestic. It's not just about splitting chores 50/50, but about a balanced approach where both partners' needs and capacities are considered. The author might be in the wrong because they're expecting the girlfriend to handle all the cooking and cleaning as compensation, which could be an unequal burden, especially if she's now feeling overworked. The author should communicate and adjust the responsibilities to suit both parties, rather than maintaining an arrangement that's causing stress.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because expecting the partner to do all the chores solely because they pay more rent might not be equitable, especially when the partner is showing signs of being overwhelmed. The right approach would be to negotiate and share responsibilities more fairly, taking into account each person's needs and circumstances.\n"

Expecting a partner to handle all cooking and cleaning as compensation for financial contributions is not equitable, especially when it leads to resentment. Household responsibilities should be shared based on mutual agreement and mutual respect, not tied to financial contributions. The author should communicate openly to adjust expectations and ensure both partners feel valued and balanced in the partnership.",
