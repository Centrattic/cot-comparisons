      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning, given the financial contributions from both partners. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for 8 years and lives in a house owned by the author. The author earns twice as much as the girlfriend and covers more of the rent and utilities. In return, the girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning. That setup worked well for two years, but recently she's been irritable about the chores.\n\nThe key points here are the financial contributions and the division of labor. The author's justification is that since they pay more, the girlfriend should do more housework. But is that a valid expectation? \n\nIn many relationships, the division of household chores isn't necessarily tied directly to income. It's more about mutual agreement and fairness based on individual circumstances. The girlfriend might feel that her contributions are not valued equally, especially if she's paying a significant portion of the rent. If the author's salary is higher, maybe the rent is covered by the author, but other expenses like groceries or utilities might be split differently. \n\nThe girlfriend's irritation suggests that the current arrangement isn't working for her. The author might be assuming that because they pay more, the girlfriend should do more, but that could be an outdated or unequal assumption. Relationships require communication and flexibility. If the chores have become a source of tension, maybe the author needs to reassess the expectations. \n\nAnother angle is that the author owns the house, which might imply some responsibility for maintenance, but that's not necessarily the case. The problem is more about the emotional labor and expectations. The author might be contributing financially, but the girlfriend might feel she's taking on disproportionate emotional or physical labor. \n\nIt's also possible that the girlfriend's irritability is due to feeling overburdened. The author should consider if the chores are being split in a way that both feel comfortable. Maybe the author isn't contributing enough in other ways, like emotional support or other tasks around the house. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's not just about who pays more but about mutual effort and respect. The author might be in the wrong if they're not considering the girlfriend's feelings and the potential imbalance in their arrangement. The situation seems to be more about the author's assumption rather than an agreed-upon division of labor. \n\nSo, based on these points, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because expecting someone to do chores solely based on financial contributions without considering mutual agreement and emotional well-being can lead to resentment.\n"
