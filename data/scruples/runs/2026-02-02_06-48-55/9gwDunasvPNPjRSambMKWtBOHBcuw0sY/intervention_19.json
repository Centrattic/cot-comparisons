      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing chores in a relationship. The author lives with his girlfriend, owns the house, and pays more because his salary is double hers. She does the cooking and cleaning, but lately, she's been irritable about it. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more housework since he pays more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for 8 years, which is a long time, so maybe expectations have changed. The author thinks that because he pays more, she should do more chores. But I should think about whether fairness in a relationship is just about who pays more. Maybe the girlfriend feels that even though she earns less, she's contributing in other ways, like cooking and cleaning, and now feels overburdened. The fact that she's been getting irritable suggests that the current arrangement isn't working for her anymore.\n\nThe user says they've been working it out for two years, but recently it's changed. Maybe she's taking on more than she can handle now, or there's some underlying issue. The author might be missing the point by focusing on financial contributions versus emotional or physical labor. It's easy to assume that splitting chores based on financial input is fair, but in reality, relationships require mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend feels she's being asked to do more, that's a sign that the dynamic needs to be re-evaluated. The author might be in the wrong because he's not considering her feelings and is sticking to a transactional view rather than a collaborative one. So the answer is A.\n"
