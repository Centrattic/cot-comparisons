      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects his girlfriend to do more cooking and cleaning because he pays more rent and utilities, given that his salary is twice hers and he owns the house. The girlfriend has been doing the chores, but lately, she's getting irritable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is assuming that because he contributes more financially, he's entitled to have her handle more chores. But maybe that's not the right approach. Relationships usually require mutual respect and consideration, not just a transactional exchange of chores for money. Even though he pays more, it's not necessarily fair to expect her to do all the cleaning and cooking, especially if that's causing her stress.\n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together for 8 years suggests they should have established a balanced routine. If she's been doing the chores for two years and now is getting upset, maybe the workload is too much. It might be that the author hasn't checked in with her feelings about the arrangement beyond just the financial aspect. Communication is key here. He might be taking her contributions for granted, not realizing that her irritation is a sign that the current setup isn't working for her anymore.\n\nAnother angle is that domestic responsibilities aren't always about splitting chores based on income. It's more about what each partner is comfortable with and what works for both. If she's irritable, maybe she needs help or a different arrangement. The author might be in the wrong by not adjusting the chores or discussing her feelings instead of expecting her to continue as before. So, yes, he could be in the wrong for not considering her perspective and not being flexible when her needs have changed.\n"
