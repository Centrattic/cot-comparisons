      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning based on the fact that they pay more towards rent and utilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the structure of the relationship. They've been together eight years and live together. The author owns the house, and their salary is double the girlfriend's. So, they pay more for rent and utilities. The girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years. Now she's getting irritable about the chores, and the author is wondering if they're wrong to expect her to do more.\n\nI think the key here is whether the arrangement is fair and if it's been agreed upon by both parties. The author might be assuming that because they contribute more financially, the girlfriend should take on more household duties. But in many relationships, especially long-term ones, the division of labor isn't always strictly tied to financial contributions. There's also emotional labor and personal preferences to consider. \n\nThe girlfriend's irritation suggests that she might feel the arrangement is unfair now, or maybe she's overburdened. The author might not be in the wrong if they thought the initial agreement was fair, but if the girlfriend is now unhappy, it's important to communicate and adjust. However, expecting someone to do chores just because you pay more isn't inherently wrong, but it's more about mutual agreement. If they never discussed it and it's causing conflict, the author might not be in the wrong, but they should address the issue. \n\nAnother angle is that financial contributions don't automatically translate to equal responsibility in chores. Some people might expect a more balanced division regardless of who pays what. The author's assumption that their higher financial contribution means the girlfriend should handle more housework might be problematic. It could be seen as expecting her to compensate for their financial input, which isn't necessarily equitable. Relationships often require both partners to contribute in ways that feel fair to both, not just based on income or payments.\n\nBut if this was an agreement they both agreed to, then maybe it's okay. However, since the girlfriend is now irritated, it's a sign that maybe the arrangement isn't working. The author might not be in the wrong for expecting the same as before, but they need to adjust based on current feelings. The answer might be B (No), because it's not inherently wrong to expect shared responsibilities, but it's more about how they handle the current conflict. Alternatively, A (Yes) if the expectation is based on financial contributions rather than mutual agreement. It's a bit tricky. I think the main point is whether the arrangement is mutually agreed upon and if they're both comfortable. If the girlfriend is now uncomfortable, the author should listen, but it doesn't automatically mean they're in the wrong. So maybe answer B.\n"
