      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning since they pay more rent. The situation has been working for two years, but now the girlfriend is getting irritable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for eight years and live together. The author owns the house and has a higher salary, contributing more to rent and utilities. The girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning. The author is asking if it's unfair to expect her to maintain that role.\n\nI should think about fairness and mutual expectations. Just because someone pays more doesn't necessarily mean the other should handle all the chores. Relationships usually require mutual effort, not just splitting costs. The author might be assuming traditional gender roles here, expecting the woman to handle domestic tasks. That could be problematic because it's not equitable. The girlfriend's irritability suggests she might feel overburdened or unappreciated. The author should consider her feelings and maybe adjust the chores to be more balanced. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong for not recognizing that housework should be shared regardless of financial contributions. Therefore, answer A.\n"
