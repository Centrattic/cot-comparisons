      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework based on financial contributions. The situation is that they've been together for 8 years, live together, and the author owns the house. His salary is twice her salary, so he pays more rent and utilities. She does the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their arrangement. The author is using financial contribution as a reason to expect more housework from his girlfriend. The key point here is whether it's fair to tie chores to who pays how much. In some relationships, people split chores based on income, but that can lead to issues if one person feels it's unfair or if the balance shifts over time.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The girlfriend might feel that the chores are her responsibility, but if the author is using his higher income as a justification, that could be seen as unfair. Even if he pays more, housework isn't always negotiable in the same way as money. Expecting her to do more because he contributes financially more might not consider her own contributions and could be seen as taking advantage.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's been irritable recently might indicate that the arrangement isn't working anymore. The author might not be considering her feelings or the emotional labor she's putting in. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. If the author is rigid in his expectations without discussing the situation, that's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, if both agreed initially that she would handle the chores in exchange for him covering more expenses, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if the arrangement was informal and now he's expecting her to do more, that's where the issue arises. The problem might be that the author is not adapting to her current feelings and is sticking to an old agreement without communication.\n\nAnother angle is that housework should be shared equally regardless of income. The author's approach could be seen as transactional, which might not be healthy long-term. Expecting someone to do chores based on financial contributions can lead to resentment if one person feels it's not balanced.\n\nIn summary, the author might be assuming that because he pays more, she should do more, but this could be unfair. The key is whether the arrangement was mutually agreed upon and if there's open communication. Since the user thinks the author is wrong and the situation seems to be causing conflict, it's likely that the author is not considering his girlfriend's perspective and needs to adjust his expectations.\n"
