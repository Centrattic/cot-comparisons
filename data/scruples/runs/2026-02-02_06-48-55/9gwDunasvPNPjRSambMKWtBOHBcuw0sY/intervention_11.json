      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about household chores and finances.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years and live in a house he owns. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more for rent and utilities. She does the cooking and cleaning. Recently, she's been irritable about chores. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more because he pays more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are financial contributions versus household responsibilities. The author is assuming that because he contributes more financially, he's entitled to her doing more chores. But is that fair?\n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about splitting tasks based on income. Both partners have different strengths and preferences. Even if one makes more, expecting the other to handle all chores might not be balanced. Maybe they need to discuss and adjust roles based on what's manageable for both, not just financial contributions.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests she's feeling overburdened or maybe undervalued. The author might not be considering her feelings beyond the financial aspect. Maybe he's not recognizing her efforts or the emotional labor involved. \n\nAnother angle: living in a house owned by him, but they both live there. The financial responsibility isn't the only factor. Shared living means shared responsibilities, even if one pays more. Expecting someone to do chores because you pay more could come off as transactional, which might not be healthy in a relationship.\n\nBut then again, some people might have traditional roles. However, in modern relationships, it's more about mutual agreement rather than assuming roles based on income. The author might not be wrong if they had an explicit agreement, but since there's tension, maybe it's time to reassess.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably in the wrong because he's using his financial contribution as a basis for expecting more chores from his partner without considering her feelings or their mutual needs. The right approach would be communication and finding a balance that works for both, not assigning chores based on who earns more.\n"
