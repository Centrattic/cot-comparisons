      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. They live together, he owns the house, his salary is twice hers, so he pays more towards rent and utilities. She does the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years. Now she's been irritable about some chores. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for thinking she should do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together eight years, so it's a long-term partnership. The fact that he owns the house and pays more due to higher income is a significant point. But does that mean she's obligated to do more chores? Maybe they had an informal agreement, but relationships often require mutual adjustment. \n\nIn many relationships, chores are divided based on what each person can do, not necessarily based on income. Even if he pays more, that doesn't inherently mean she has to do all the chores. However, the fact that she's been doing it for two years without complaint might suggest an unspoken agreement, but now her irritability indicates she might feel overburdened.\n\nAlso, gender roles can play a part here. In some societies, women are expected to handle more domestic work, but modern relationships often aim for equality. The key here is communication. The author might be assuming that because he's contributing more financially, she should contribute more domestically. But domestic responsibilities are a separate aspect of partnership. \n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend might feel that her contributions aren't recognized or that the balance isn't fair. If he's expecting her to do more without considering her feelings or workload, that's a problem. The author's assumption that she must do more just because he pays more could be the issue. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the agreement is fair and if both parties are comfortable. The author might be in the wrong if he's not considering her perspective and the current imbalance in chores. It's about mutual respect and communication rather than financial contributions dictating household responsibilities.\n"
