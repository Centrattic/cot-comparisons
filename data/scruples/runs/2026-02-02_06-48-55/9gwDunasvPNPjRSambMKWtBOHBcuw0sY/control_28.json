      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who posted this question is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years and live together. The house is in his name, and he earns twice as much as she does, so he pays more for rent and utilities. In exchange, she does the cooking and cleaning. This setup has worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable about the chores. The author is wondering if he's at fault for expecting her to handle more housework since he contributes more financially.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is about the division of household responsibilities. The author thinks it's fair because he pays more, but the girlfriend is upset. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, financial contributions are a factor, and it's common for people to balance responsibilities based on income. On the other hand, relationships are about mutual respect and communication. If the arrangement was agreed upon and then changed without discussion, that could be a problem. Also, expecting someone to do all the chores might be seen as unequal, regardless of financial contributions. But if both parties were comfortable with the initial setup, maybe the issue is that the girlfriend's needs have changed, and the author isn't adapting. \n\nWait, the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial agreement might have been fair, but if the girlfriend is now unhappy, the author should address her feelings. The problem might be that he's not considering her current feelings and is sticking to an old arrangement. So, the author's mistake could be not communicating and adjusting to her needs. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because relationships require ongoing communication and flexibility. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to make sure. Let me check again. The author expects her to do more because he pays more, but if that's causing her stress, he should re-evaluate. So, the answer is A.\n"
