      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they live together, the author owns the house and pays more towards rent/utilities because their salary is twice the girlfriend's. They've been together 8 years, and this arrangement has worked for two years, but now the girlfriend is getting irritable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is using the financial contribution as a reason to expect more chores from the girlfriend. But relationships aren't just about splitting chores based on who pays what. Emotional labor, fairness, and mutual respect are important. Even if someone contributes more financially, that doesn't necessarily mean they should handle less domestic work. It can lead to an imbalance where one person feels they're doing more than their fair share.\n\nThe girlfriend is now expressing dissatisfaction. The author's response is to question if she should do more because he pays more. That seems like he's not considering her feelings or the fact that maybe the workload is too much for her. It might be that the girlfriend is taking on more than she's comfortable with, or perhaps the division of labor isn't equitable.\n\nI should also think about expectations in relationships. If this arrangement was agreed upon mutually and it was working before, maybe the girlfriend's needs have changed. The author's approach here is to justify his position based on financial contributions, which might not account for her current stress or workload. It's possible that the author isn't being empathetic enough, expecting her to maintain the same level of housework without considering her perspective.\n\nAnother angle: the fact that the house is in the author's name might give him a sense of entitlement, but that doesn't automatically mean he's right to expect more from his partner. Relationships should be about partnership and shared responsibilities, not just financial balance. Maybe the author is not recognizing that emotional and domestic work are also significant contributions.\n\nAlso, the salary difference leading to different financial contributions is a common scenario, but it's about how both parties feel about it. If the girlfriend feels overburdened with chores despite the financial arrangement, the author might need to reassess and find a more balanced approach rather than insisting she continues as before.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's not addressing his girlfriend's concerns and is instead reinforcing the existing unequal division of labor based on financial contributions. A healthy relationship requires open communication and adapting to each other's needs. The author's stance seems rigid and self-centered, not considering her feelings or the possibility that the current arrangement isn't working for her anymore.\n"
