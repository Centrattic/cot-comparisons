      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the guy owns the house, earns twice as much as his girlfriend, so he pays more rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. But now she's been irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to keep doing them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. They've been together for 8 years and live together. The man owns the house, so maybe he has a stake in maintaining it. Financially, he's contributing more, which he uses as a reason for her to do more chores. But the question is whether that's fair.\n\nI think this is a common issue in relationships. The key points are expectations and communication. The man might believe that since he pays more, she should handle more chores. But is that a fair assumption? It depends on the agreement between them. If it was an unspoken understanding, maybe she feels it's unequal now. Also, societal norms might play a role. Traditionally, women might take on more domestic work, but that's changing. If she's feeling it's unfair, even if he's paying more rent, maybe he's not considering her perspective.\n\nAnother angle: chores aren't just about who pays what. They're about shared living. Even if he pays more rent, does that mean chores should be divided based on income? Or is it a 50-50 split? Maybe the initial arrangement worked, but over time, she feels it's not balanced. The fact that she's irritable suggests there's a problem. The guy might be assuming she should keep doing the same, but maybe she's taking on more than she's comfortable with.\n\nAlso, the fact that the house is in his name might mean he's responsible for maintenance costs, which could be a hidden cost. But that's part of his ownership. However, the rent he pays to himself is just a transfer within the relationship. So maybe the real issue is the division of labor, not necessarily the rent.\n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships should ideally involve mutual agreement and adjustment. If the arrangement was okay for two years but is causing stress now, maybe it's time to reevaluate. The guy might be in the wrong if he's not open to discussing and adjusting the chores. It's not about who pays what but about what feels fair to both parties. Expecting her to handle all cleaning and cooking based on financial contributions could be outdated or unfair, especially if she's also contributing in other ways.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The man's assumption that his higher financial contribution entitles him to less domestic work might be the source of the problem. The answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because the arrangement should be based on mutual agreement and comfort, not just financial contributions. But I should make sure I'm not making assumptions about how much each person is contributing. Maybe they had an explicit agreement, but if she's now unhappy, he needs to listen and adjust. The key is the lack of communication and adjustment. If he's not willing to talk it over, then he's in the wrong.\n"
