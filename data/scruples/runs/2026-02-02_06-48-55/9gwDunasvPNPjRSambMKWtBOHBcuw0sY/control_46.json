      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning, given that he pays more of the rent and utilities because his salary is higher. They've been together 8 years and live together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a long time, so maybe they've had an unspoken agreement about chores. The author thinks that since he contributes more financially, she should handle more housework. But the girlfriend is getting irritable now.\n\nI should think about fairness and mutual expectations. In many relationships, chores are shared regardless of financial contributions. But some people might feel that if one person pays more, the other should handle more chores. However, it's also possible that expectations have changed over time. Maybe the girlfriend feels the work is unbalanced or that her contributions aren't valued.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author might not be considering her perspective. If she's irritable, it's a sign that something's off. Maybe she's taking on more than she can handle or feels it's unfair in another way. The author's assumption that he's right because he pays more might be the issue. It's possible that they need to renegotiate their household responsibilities.\n\nAlso, financial contribution vs. chores isn't a universal formula. Some relationships split chores equally, while others adjust based on other factors like time available, physical ability, etc. The author's reasoning is based on paying more, but if that's causing tension, it might not be the right approach.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's expecting a certain arrangement without considering her feelings or the current situation. The key is that relationships require mutual understanding and adjustment. Assuming that financial contribution dictates chores could be problematic and overlooks the need for a balanced, communicative partnership.\n"
