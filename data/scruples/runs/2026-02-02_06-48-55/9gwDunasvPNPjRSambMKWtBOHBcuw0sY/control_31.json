      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe person is asking if they're at fault for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. They've been together for 8 years and live together. The house is in the man's name, and he earns twice as much as his girlfriend, so he pays more for rent and utilities. In return, the girlfriend handles cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years, but she's been getting irritable lately. The man is questioning if she should do more housework since he pays more.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're not married, but they've been together a long time. The man owns the house and contributes more financially, so he might feel entitled to having the girlfriend handle more domestic tasks. However, expectations around chores can vary, and what worked before might not be sustainable now.\n\nThe key points here are mutual agreement and changing circumstances. If the arrangement was mutual and agreed upon, then maybe the man isn't in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's irritability indicates that the current setup isn't working for her, perhaps the man isn't being considerate enough. Also, just because he pays more doesn't necessarily mean she should do all the chores. Relationships often require flexibility and communication.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that financial contribution translates to equal distribution of chores. That might not be fair. Even if he pays more, emotional labor and physical labor are important. Maybe the girlfriend feels overburdened with the chores despite the financial arrangement. The man might not be acknowledging her contributions beyond just the chores he expects.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. Traditionally, there's been an expectation that the person earning more would have the other handle more housework, but modern relationships often emphasize equality. However, every relationship is different based on what both parties agree on.\n\nSince the arrangement worked for two years but is causing issues now, maybe there's a need for a renegotiation. The man might be wrong in expecting her to maintain the same level without considering her current feelings. It's possible he's not wrong, but if he's not open to discussing and adjusting the chores based on her feedback, then he might be in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the man is in the wrong for expecting her to do more because he pays more. If the expectation is based on a past agreement and he's not being responsive to her current irritability, that could be problematic. The answer might hinge on communication. If he's not willing to talk about it and adjust, then he's at fault. If he's open to discussing, maybe not. But based on the info given, he's not considering her current state, which could be a problem.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) if the assumption is that he's not being flexible, or B (not in the wrong) if the original agreement still stands. It's a bit ambiguous, but leaning towards A because expecting someone to do more without considering their feelings now could be unfair.\n"
