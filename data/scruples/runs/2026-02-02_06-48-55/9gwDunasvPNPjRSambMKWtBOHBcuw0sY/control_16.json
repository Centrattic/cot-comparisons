      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years and live together. He owns the house, and his salary is twice hers, so he pays more for rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. But recently, she's been getting irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The fact that they've been together for 8 years suggests a long-term partnership. In such relationships, expectations can evolve over time. What worked two years ago might not work now. The author's reasoning is that since he pays more, she should do more chores. But does that make sense?\n\nHousehold responsibilities aren't always directly tied to income or who owns the property. In many relationships, chores are divided based on what each person can do, their preferences, and mutual agreement rather than financial contributions. The author's approach seems to be a quid pro quo: you pay more, so I do more. But maybe that's a outdated or unfair assumption. \n\nAlso, gender roles might come into play here. If the author is assuming that because he pays more, she should handle the domestic work, that could be reinforcing traditional gender roles where women are expected to manage the home regardless of their financial input. This could be the source of her irritation. \n\nAnother angle is communication. If the arrangement was previously agreed upon but now she's unhappy, the author might not be in the wrong for expecting the same as before, but he might not be addressing her current feelings. Maybe the expectations need to be renegotiated. \n\nThe key here is whether the agreement is consensual and fair. If she agreed to take on more chores in exchange for him paying more, then he's not wrong. But if she's now resentful, that suggests the arrangement isn't working for her anymore. The author's question is whether he's wrong for expecting her to continue. \n\nHowever, the problem is that he's assuming her irritability is because she's not doing enough, but maybe she feels overburdened or that the division isn't fair. The author might need to have a conversation to understand her perspective instead of assuming he's right. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's maintaining an expectation based on past contributions without considering her current feelings or if the arrangement was ever mutual, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the arrangement was supposed to be a fair exchange and she's now overworked, he might be. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more. \n\nIn many cases, relationships require flexibility. If the previous arrangement is causing stress, the author should be open to adjusting. However, the initial premise that the chores are in exchange for financial support might not be a standard practice. Some people split chores equally regardless of income, while others might have different arrangements. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the original agreement was mutual and if there's been a change in circumstances. The author's approach might be seen as unfair if it's based on traditional roles or if it's causing her distress. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not adapting the arrangement based on her current feelings. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more because he pays more, there's a nuance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's following an agreement they had. However, if she's now unhappy, maybe he's not considering her needs. It's a bit of a toss-up. In many modern relationships, equal sharing is expected, but that's not universal. The problem is that the author is questioning if he's right to expect her to do more, which implies he's not considering that her role might have changed or that she's overburdened. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the arrangement might be based on unequal expectations and traditional gender roles, leading to her irritation. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is B if the arrangement was mutually agreed. However, since she's now irritable, maybe the author is not in the wrong for expecting the same as before, but he should adjust. The question is whether he's in the wrong now. \n\nHmm. The Reddit style usually leans towards considering mutual agreement and current feelings. If the arrangement was previously okay but now she's upset, the author might not be in the wrong for the expectation itself, but he's ignoring her current feelings. So maybe the answer is A because he's not considering her current needs. But I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe B if the original arrangement was fair and he hasn't changed anything. \n\nI think the key is that expecting someone to do chores because you pay more can be problematic. It's not necessarily fair to tie domestic work to financial contributions unless both parties agree. If she's now unhappy, the author might be in the wrong for not adjusting. So answer A.\n"
