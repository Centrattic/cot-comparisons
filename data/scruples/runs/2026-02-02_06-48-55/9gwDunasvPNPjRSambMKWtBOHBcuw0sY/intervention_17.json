      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been together for 8 years and live together. He owns the house, and his salary is twice hers, so he pays more towards rent and utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable about some chores. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for expecting her to handle more housework since he covers more of the costs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is assuming that because he pays more, she should do more chores. But is that a fair assumption? Money isn't the only factor in a relationship. Emotional labor, personal preferences, and the value of time should also be considered. If the arrangement was mutually agreed upon and working for two years, maybe the recent irritability is a sign that it's causing her stress. The author might not be considering her feelings or workload. \n\nAlso, the fact that he owns the house and pays more doesn't necessarily mean he should expect her to handle all the chores. Relationships should be about teamwork and mutual support, not a transactional exchange. Maybe the author is taking for granted her contributions and not recognizing the effort she puts in. If she's feeling overwhelmed, he should talk to her to find a better balance instead of insisting she does more. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that contributing financially entitles him to less household responsibility. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should share responsibilities based on their capabilities and preferences, not just financial contributions. It's possible that the author isn't considering her current workload or her need for help. The irritability she's showing could be a sign that the current setup isn't sustainable or fair anymore. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong because he's making an assumption based on financial contributions rather than her well-being and the overall balance in the relationship. He should communicate with her to understand her perspective and adjust the responsibilities accordingly.\n"
