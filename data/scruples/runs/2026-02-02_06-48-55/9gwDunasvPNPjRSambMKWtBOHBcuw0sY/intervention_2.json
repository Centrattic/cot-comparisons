      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework because he pays a larger share of the rent and utilities. They've been together 8 years and live together. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more. She does cooking and cleaning, but now she's irritable about it. He's wondering if he's the asshole (AITA) for thinking she should do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They live together, so shared responsibilities are expected. But how are these responsibilities divided based on income? The author is thinking that since he pays more, she should do more chores. But that might be problematic because financial contributions don't necessarily dictate household duties. Relationships often require mutual effort regardless of who pays more. \n\nHousehold chores aren't just about splitting costs; they're about maintaining the living environment for both. Even if one person pays more, both benefit from a clean home and meals. So expecting the other to handle all the chores based on their contribution to rent might be unfair. It's about fairness and respect, not just financials.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests that she might feel overburdened or that her contributions aren't recognized. Maybe the division of chores isn't in line with their actual capabilities or willingness. The author might not be considering her feelings or the fact that she's also contributing in other ways. \n\nMoreover, the assumption that higher financial contribution equals more chores could lead to resentment. It's possible the author isn't sharing other responsibilities, or maybe there's an imbalance in how they split tasks. The key here is communication. The author might be making assumptions without discussing the current situation with his girlfriend, leading to her irritation.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's tying chores to financial contributions, which isn't a standard or fair approach. Relationships should involve mutual agreement and balance, not a transactional model. His expectation might be unrealistic and could cause more conflict instead of resolving it.\n"
