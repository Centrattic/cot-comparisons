      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning because he pays more of the rent and utilities. They've been together 8 years, live together, and the house is in his name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The author pays more because his salary is double hers. He uses that as a reason for her to do more chores. But is that fair? Splitting chores shouldn't necessarily correlate directly with who pays more. Housework is a shared responsibility, not a debt owed based on income. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend has been getting irritable lately. That suggests she's unhappy with the current arrangement. If the author is making her do chores as compensation, maybe he's not considering her feelings or the balance of their relationship. Relationships should be about mutual respect and support. Expecting someone to do chores because you pay more can come off as transactional. \n\nMoreover, the fact that the house is in his name might add to the imbalance. He might feel ownership over the space, leading to higher expectations. But even then, housework is part of shared living. It's possible the author isn't seeing the emotional labor and effort she's putting in, especially if she's stressed or overworked. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the author isn't contributing enough. If he's paying more financially, does he help with other responsibilities? If he's not doing his part, that's a problem. The key here is communication. They should talk about their expectations and find a balance that works for both, rather than one person dictating based on financial contributions. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering her feelings and the fairness of the arrangement. The chores should be shared equitably, not based on income. The fact that she's getting irritable indicates that the current setup isn't working for her. The author's reasoning is flawed because it's not about who pays more, but about mutual effort and respect in maintaining their shared home.\n"
