      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 8 years, live together. He owns the house, pays more due to a higher salary. She does the cooking and cleaning. But now she's getting irritable. He's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness in chores. The author's reasoning is that since he pays more, she should do more chores. But is that a valid expectation?\n\nI remember that in relationships, expectations are often based on mutual agreement and communication. Just because one person pays more doesn't automatically mean the other should do all the chores. It's about the balance of contributions, not just monetary. Maybe the girlfriend feels that she's contributing in other ways, or that the chores are unfair. Also, 8 years is a long time; maybe things have changed over time, and the initial arrangement isn't working anymore.\n\nAnother angle: The author might be assuming that chores should be proportional to income or financial contribution. But that's not a common standard. Usually, chores are divided based on what each person can do, their preferences, and mutual agreement. The fact that he owns the house and pays more might not be a valid reason to assign chores. It's possible that the girlfriend feels the chores are too much, or that they're not shared equally despite the financial contributions.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests she's unhappy with the current setup. The author might not be considering her perspective or how she's feeling. It's important to communicate and adjust the chores based on both parties' needs and capacities. Maybe she's taking on more than she can handle, or there's another issue causing her stress that's unrelated to chores.\n\nIn terms of fairness, expecting someone to do chores based on financial contributions can be seen as transactional. Relationships are usually about mutual support and respect, not just a barter system. The author might be missing the point that emotional and physical labor are also important contributions. If the girlfriend is doing all the chores, that's a significant part of domestic work, which can be as valuable as financial support.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not considering the emotional aspect and the need for a balanced, communicative approach to household responsibilities. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
