      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house and earns twice her salary, so he pays more in rent/utilities. She does the chores, which worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're in a long-term partnership, not married, but living together. Financial contributions are unequal\u2014his salary is double hers, so he pays more. The question is whether the division of chores is fair. He's arguing that since he contributes more financially, she should handle the chores. But maybe there's an assumption that financial contribution equates to responsibility for chores. \n\nBut wait, in many relationships, chores are divided based on convenience, time availability, or mutual agreement rather than financial contributions. The problem here is that the author is using his financial input as a reason for her to do more chores. However, this might not account for other factors like time, energy, or personal preferences. \n\nThe girlfriend has been doing the chores but is now irritable. That suggests she might be feeling overburdened or unappreciated. If the author expects her to continue without considering her feelings or workload, that's a problem. It's possible that the initial arrangement was agreed upon, but circumstances have changed, or maybe the workload has increased. \n\nAlso, the fact that he owns the house might imply that he expects her to maintain it, but that's not necessarily fair unless both parties agree. The key here is mutual respect and communication. If the author hasn't discussed her feelings and is instead insisting based on financial contributions, that's where he's in the wrong. Financial contributions don't automatically justify unequal division of labor unless both parties agree to that arrangement. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the chores are taking up too much of her time, affecting her well-being. The author should be empathetic and consider adjusting the chores or sharing more responsibility, rather than sticking to a rigid system based on money. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is framing the issue as a transactional exchange (money for chores), but relationships are about mutual support and flexibility. By not addressing her irritation and maintaining the expectation, he's not being considerate. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
