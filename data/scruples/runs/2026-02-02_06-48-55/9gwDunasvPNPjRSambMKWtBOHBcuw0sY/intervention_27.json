      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The setup is that they've been together for 8 years, live in a house owned by the author, and he pays more because his salary is twice hers. The arrangement has been that she does the chores as compensation. Now she's getting irritable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the arrangement. The author is using the financial contribution as a basis for assigning chores. But chores aren't just about money; they're about shared responsibilities in a relationship. Even if one partner pays more, it's generally expected that both contribute to household tasks. The problem here is that the author sees the chores as a form of compensation, which might not be a fair or healthy dynamic. \n\nAnother angle is communication. If the girlfriend is now getting irritable, maybe the expectations have changed or there's an imbalance. The author assumes she should continue doing more because he pays more, but relationships require mutual effort and flexibility. It's possible that the girlfriend feels overburdened or that her contributions aren't valued beyond just chores. \n\nAlso, since they live together long-term, expecting her to do more based on financial input might not account for other factors like time availability, personal preferences, or emotional labor. The key here is whether the arrangement is a mutual agreement or an unspoken expectation that's causing resentment. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's imposing an unequal division of labor without considering her feelings or the evolving needs of the relationship. It's important for both partners to discuss and adjust responsibilities as needed, rather than sticking to a rigid system based on financial contributions alone.\n"
