      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning because he pays more towards rent and utilities. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 8 years and live together. The house is in his name, and his salary is twice hers. They've had an arrangement where he pays more, so she does the chores. But now she's getting irritable.\n\nSo the question is whether it's fair for him to expect her to do more because he contributes more financially. I need to consider if financial contributions alone should determine the division of household chores.\n\nIn many relationships, the expectation isn't always proportional to financial input. Emotional labor, time, and personal preferences all play a role. Maybe the arrangement worked for two years, but now she's feeling it's unfair. The key here is communication. If he's not considering her feelings and the arrangement isn't working anymore, he might be in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that the house is in his name might give him a sense of ownership, but that's separate from shared responsibilities in a relationship. Even if he pays more, mutual respect and adjustment are important. If she's irritable, it's a sign the current setup isn't meeting both of their needs. He should probably revisit the arrangement and talk about it instead of assuming she should keep doing more just because he pays more. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he's not addressing her feelings and the existing arrangement might be unequal now. But I need to check if there's any cultural or traditional factors, but the question doesn't mention that. The key is the current conflict and his expectation without considering her perspective.\n"
