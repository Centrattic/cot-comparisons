      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning based on the fact that he pays more of the rent and utilities. They've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, his salary is twice hers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They have an arrangement where she does chores because he pays more. But now she's getting irritable. The author is questioning if it's fair to expect more from her since he contributes more financially.\n\nThe key points here are fairness, mutual agreement, and communication. Just because he pays more doesn't automatically mean he's entitled to more chores from her. Relationships require balancing contributions beyond just financial aspects. Emotional labor and household responsibilities are also important. Maybe the arrangement was agreed upon, but if her workload has increased or she's feeling overburdened, it's a sign that the balance might be off.\n\nAlso, the fact that he owns the house and pays more utilities doesn't necessarily translate to her having to do all the chores. It's more about mutual respect and what both parties are comfortable with. If she's getting irritable, maybe the author isn't considering her feelings or workload anymore. He might be assuming that his higher financial contribution justifies more household labor from her, which could be seen as transactional rather than a partnership.\n\nAnother angle is that the initial arrangement worked for two years but now there's a change. Maybe her circumstances changed, or she's taking on more responsibilities outside the home. It's possible that the author hasn't adapted to these changes, leading to her irritation. The author might need to reassess the division of labor, communicate better, and find a fairer balance rather than sticking to the old arrangement.\n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about splitting things 50/50 in every aspect. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's contributions. If the author is expecting her to do more just because he pays more, he might be overlooking her contributions and emotions, which can create resentment. So, he could be in the wrong for not addressing the imbalance in chores and not being attuned to her feelings.\n"
