      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. The situation is that they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, his salary is double hers, and she does the cooking and cleaning. Recently, she's been getting irritable, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more because he pays more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a long time, so maybe their expectations have changed. He owns the house and pays more utilities because his salary is higher. He thinks she should do more housework as a trade-off. But she's getting upset now. \n\nThe key here is whether it's fair to link housework to financial contributions. Traditionally, some people might expect that the partner earning more would pay for expenses and the other would handle chores. But relationships are about mutual respect and communication. If their arrangement was working for two years, maybe there's a shift now. Perhaps she feels overburdened or that her contributions aren't valued. He might be assuming she should do more based on his higher income, but maybe she feels that's not fair anymore. \n\nAlso, since they live together, sharing responsibilities should be part of their partnership. If she's doing all the cooking and cleaning, maybe he's not contributing enough. It's possible that he's not doing his fair share, making her feel it's a trade-off where she's giving more than she's getting. The fact that he owns the house and pays more might not necessarily mean she should do all the chores. Relationships should ideally involve shared responsibilities regardless of financial contributions unless both agree otherwise. \n\nHe might be in the wrong if he's expecting her to do more because he pays more, without considering her feelings or if the workload is too much. Maybe the balance has shifted, and he needs to adjust his contributions. The answer would depend on whether he's being reasonable and communicative. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer could be A (yes) if he's not allowing flexibility or considering her perspective. Alternatively, B (no) if their original agreement was mutual and he's sticking to it. However, given that she's becoming irritable, it's possible he's not adjusting to her needs, so he might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A because he's expecting her to do more based on his higher payments, which might not be fair. Relationships require balance and mutual effort, not just a transactional approach.\n"
