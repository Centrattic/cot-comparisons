      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about household responsibilities and finances.\n\nThe person owns the house and has a higher salary, so they pay more rent and utilities. Their girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning. But now she's getting irritable, and the author is wondering if they're at fault for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if there's a right or wrong here. Household chores can be subjective. The author pays more, so maybe they think that justifies more work from her. But relationships aren't just about splitting chores based on income; they're about mutual respect and communication.\n\nThe key points: they've been together for 8 years and it worked for 2 years. Now she's irritated. Maybe the expectations have changed? Maybe she feels overburdened. The author might not realize that her feelings have shifted. \n\nIs it fair to assign chores based on who pays more? Not necessarily. Financial contributions and household labor aren't directly proportional. Both partners should contribute in ways they're comfortable with, but it's about balance and communication. If she's struggling, maybe the author should take on more, but the question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he pays more, so she should do more. But in a relationship, it's about teamwork. Maybe he's not considering her feelings or the fact that she might be overwhelmed. The fact that she's getting irritable suggests that the current arrangement isn't working for her. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's not addressing her feelings and is holding onto an old agreement without checking in.\n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering her current feelings and the arrangement might be unfair now.\n"
