      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning. They've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house and pays more due to a higher salary. The girlfriend does the chores as a way to compensate.\n\nFirst, financial contributions vs. household chores. The common idea might be that if one person pays more, the other does more chores. But that's a generalization. The problem here is that the girlfriend is getting irritable about it. So, the author is questioning whether he's right to expect her to do more. But he's also the one who set up this arrangement where she does chores because he pays more. Now she's unhappy with the workload. \n\nThe key points: They've been together a long time, so maybe the arrangement was okay before but things have changed. Maybe she's working more, or the chores have increased. The author isn't considering her feelings and is focusing on the financial aspect. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If she's feeling overburdened, the author should be empathetic rather than insisting she keeps up the same level of work. \n\nAlso, the fact that he owns the house and pays more might not be a valid reason for her to do all the chores. Housework is a shared responsibility in many relationships, regardless of income. Expecting someone to do chores just because you pay more could be seen as unfair, especially if it's causing stress. The author might be taking her contributions for granted. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not being considerate of her current feelings and the imbalance in the workload. He should be more open to adjusting the chores to make it a fair division based on what they can handle now, not just past agreements.\n"
