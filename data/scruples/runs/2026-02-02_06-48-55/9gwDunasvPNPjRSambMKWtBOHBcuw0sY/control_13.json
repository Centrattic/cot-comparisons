      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework. The situation is that they've been together for 8 years, live together, he owns the house, and his salary is twice hers. He pays more of the rent and utilities, so she does cooking and cleaning. But recently, she's been irritable about chores. The author thinks she should do more because he pays more.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The fact that he owns the house might mean he has a financial stake there. But in a relationship, especially a long-term one, expectations about household responsibilities can vary. He's using the compensation model where he pays more, so she handles the chores. But now she's upset. \n\nIs it fair to assume that financial contributions should directly translate to household duties? Maybe not. Relationships often require mutual understanding and adjustment. If he's paying more, perhaps he could take on more chores too. But he's expecting her to do more because he pays more, which might not consider her feelings or workload.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's been irritable might indicate she's feeling overburdened. The author might not be considering her contributions beyond just the chores. Maybe she has other responsibilities or is stressed. Expecting her to do more just because he pays more could be seen as unfair, especially if the balance isn't working for her anymore.\n\nAnother angle: in some cultures or relationships, traditional roles are expected, but that doesn't mean they're right. The key here is communication. The author might not be wrong if they had an agreement, but if the agreement isn't working now, he might need to adjust. Since she's expressing dissatisfaction, it's a sign that the current arrangement isn't equitable for her.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he's not considering her feelings and the arrangement might need renegotiation. He's assuming his payment entitles him to more from her, which isn't necessarily fair. Therefore, AITA would be answer A, he is in the wrong.\n"
