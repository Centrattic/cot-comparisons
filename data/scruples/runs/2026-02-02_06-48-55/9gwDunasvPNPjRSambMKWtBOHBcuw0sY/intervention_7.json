      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects his girlfriend to do cooking and cleaning because he pays more of the rent/utilities. They've been together 8 years, live in a house he owns, and his salary is double hers.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are about fairness in chores and financial contributions. The author's argument is that since he pays more, she should take on more chores. But maybe there's an assumption that financial contribution directly translates to responsibility in housework. However, relationships often involve mutual agreements and emotional labor. \n\nI should think about whether it's fair to link chores to financial contributions. Maybe the author is not considering that housework is a shared responsibility regardless of income. Also, expecting her to handle all cooking and cleaning could be seen as unequal. The girlfriend's irritability suggests she feels overburdened. \n\nAnother angle: the author owns the house, so maybe he expects her to maintain it. But in a partnership, both partners usually contribute. If the girlfriend is doing all the chores, that might be unfair even if he pays more. Money and chores aren't always directly proportional. \n\nAlso, the duration of the relationship (8 years) means they might have established a routine, but if her workload has increased or she's unhappy, that's a red flag. The author might be overlooking her feelings and the balance of work in the household. \n\nI think the author is assuming that his higher financial contribution justifies her doing more chores, but in reality, household responsibilities are often shared to maintain equality and mutual support. So he might be in the wrong for not adjusting their arrangement to account for her workload or her changing feelings. The answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
