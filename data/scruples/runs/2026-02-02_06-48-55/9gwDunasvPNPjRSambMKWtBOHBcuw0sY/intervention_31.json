      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning based on the financial contributions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for 8 years and lives together. The author owns the house solely and earns twice as much as his girlfriend. He pays more rent/utilities, so she does the cooking and cleaning. This arrangement worked for two years, but now she's getting irritable. The author is wondering if he's at fault for expecting her to handle more chores since he pays more.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is the fairness of splitting chores based on income. The author's reasoning is that since he contributes more financially, she should handle more chores. But is that a valid expectation? \n\nI think there are a few points to consider. First, in a healthy relationship, both partners should have a mutual agreement on responsibilities. If this was an initial agreement, maybe it's time to revisit it. But if the arrangement was informal and now things have changed, maybe the author hasn't considered her changing needs or workload.\n\nAlso, expecting her to do chores as compensation for his financial contribution might be seen as transactional rather than cooperative. Relationships thrive on mutual respect and consideration, not a strict quid pro quo. If she's becoming irritable, it could indicate that the current arrangement isn't working for her anymore. The author might not be in the wrong if this was a mutual agreement, but if he's enforcing it without considering her feelings or circumstances, then he might be at fault.\n\nAnother angle is that chores are a shared responsibility regardless of financial contributions. Even if one person earns more, household duties are typically split based on what each person can contribute, not just money. So expecting her to do all the cleaning and cooking just because he pays more might be unfair, especially if her role has become overwhelming.\n\nMoreover, the fact that she's been getting irritable suggests that the current setup is causing her stress. The author should be attuned to her feelings and be willing to adjust the household responsibilities. Instead of focusing on the financial aspect, it's better to discuss and find a balance that works for both parties.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's assuming that his higher financial contribution justifies her taking on all the chores. It's possible he hasn't considered her perspective or the emotional labor involved. Relationships require flexibility and communication, so expecting her to continue in the same role without addressing her concerns could be problematic.\n"
