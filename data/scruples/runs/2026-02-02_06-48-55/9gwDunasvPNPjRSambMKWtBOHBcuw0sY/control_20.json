      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for expecting their girlfriend to do more housework because he pays more towards rent and utilities. The situation is that they've been together for 8 years, live together, and he owns the house. His salary is double hers, so he covers more of the expenses. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning. But lately, she's been irritable about the chores, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the division of household chores. The user's reasoning is that since he pays more, she should contribute by doing more chores. However, relationships often require mutual effort beyond just financial contributions. Even if one partner pays more, emotional labor and domestic tasks are part of the partnership. \n\nThe girlfriend's irritability suggests she might feel overburdened or that the arrangement is unfair. The user might be assuming that money should dictate the division of labor, but that's not necessarily how relationships work. Healthy partnerships usually involve open communication and negotiation rather than transactional agreements. \n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together for 8 years implies that their dynamic might need revisiting. What worked two years ago might not be sustainable now. The user's expectation could be based on outdated norms or assumptions. It's possible he's not considering her feelings or the changing circumstances. \n\nMoreover, expecting her to do more chores just because he pays more could be seen as unfair. Contributions in a relationship aren't just financial; emotional support, quality time, and shared responsibilities also matter. If she's feeling resentful, that's a sign that the balance isn't right. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his girlfriend's perspective and the emotional aspects of the relationship. The expectation that financial contributions should determine chores is flawed, and the situation requires communication and adjustment rather than a transactional approach.\n"
