      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning based on their financial contributions. \n\nFirst, the relationship has been going on for 8 years, which is a significant amount of time. They live together, and the house is in the author's name. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more for rent and utilities. The arrangement has been that she does the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years. Now, she's getting irritable, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong by expecting her to do more.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness in domestic responsibilities. Financial contributions don't necessarily dictate how chores should be divided. Even though the author pays more, expecting someone to do more chores because of that can be seen as unfair. Relationships are about mutual respect and compromise, not just splitting tasks based on income. \n\nAlso, considering that they've been together for a long time, maybe there's an unspoken agreement that needs revisiting. The author's assumption that he's entitled to her doing more because he pays more might be the issue. It's possible he's not considering her feelings or the emotional labor involved. \n\nAnother angle: the fact that the house is in his name adds another layer. Maybe she feels that since he owns the house, she's responsible for more, but that's not a fair dynamic either. The expectation that her chores should compensate for his financial contributions might be setting up an unequal partnership. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing chores is about balancing time and effort, not just money. The author might be in the wrong for not addressing the arrangement openly and instead expecting her to continue without considering her current stress or workload. The irritation she's showing suggests that the current setup isn't working for her anymore, so maybe the author should be more flexible and discuss a new agreement rather than insisting she does more.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's approach might be contributing to the tension. It's not just about what's fair in terms of money but also about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs and limitations. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
