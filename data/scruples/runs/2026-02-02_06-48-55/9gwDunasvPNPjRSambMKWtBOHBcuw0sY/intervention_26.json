      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning based on him paying more of the rent and utilities. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for 8 years and live together. The house is in his name, and he earns twice as much as her. He pays more for rent and utilities, so he thinks she should handle more chores. But she's getting irritable.\n\nI remember from relationship advice that chores should be shared based on mutual agreement, not just financial contributions. Money and chores are separate issues. Even if he pays more, that doesn't necessarily mean he should have less responsibility at home. It's about fairness and communication. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's becoming irritable suggests there's some underlying issue. Maybe she feels overburdened or unappreciated. The author's expectation might be based on an unspoken agreement that because he pays more, she does more, but perhaps that's not a fair arrangement for both parties.\n\nI think the problem here is that the author is assuming a transactional approach where financial contributions determine domestic responsibilities. However, healthy relationships require a balance where both partners feel they are contributing in ways that are agreeable to both. If there's a shift in her feelings, it's important to discuss openly rather than assume she should continue as before. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering her feelings and the current dynamics. He should have a conversation to understand why she's irritated and find a compromise that works for both.\n"
