      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning. They've been together for 8 years, live together, and he owns the house. His salary is double hers, so he pays more rent and utilities. She does the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years, but now she's irritable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The fact that he owns the house might mean he has more financial responsibility, but they live together, so it's a shared home. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because expecting chores based on who pays more might not be fair. \n\nHousework expectations can vary. Some people might argue that splitting chores equally is fairer, regardless of income, since it's a shared living space. Others might think that if one person is contributing more monetarily, the other can take on more chores. But the key point here is that the girlfriend is getting irritable. That suggests the arrangement isn't working for her anymore.\n\nThe author is assuming she should do more because he pays more. But maybe she feels that her contribution in chores isn't enough, or that the division isn't balanced. Communication is key here. If the author hasn't discussed this with her, he might not understand her feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that they've been together for 8 years implies that their circumstances or expectations might have changed. What worked two years ago might not work now. The author's expectation might not consider her current situation or feelings. \n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about splitting things proportionally. It's about mutual respect and understanding. If the author is making her do chores because he pays more, that could be seen as transactional, which might not be healthy. The girlfriend's irritation could stem from feeling used or undervalued. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering her feelings and the evolving nature of their relationship. He should be open to discussing and adjusting the household duties instead of expecting her to maintain the previous arrangement without considering her current perspective.\n"
