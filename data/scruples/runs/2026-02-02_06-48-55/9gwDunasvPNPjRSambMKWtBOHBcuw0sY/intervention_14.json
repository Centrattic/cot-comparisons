      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle the cooking and cleaning. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the author owns the house and earns twice as much as their partner. They've had a system where the girlfriend does the chores in exchange for covering more utilities and rent. Now, she's getting irritable, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for 8 years, which is a significant amount of time, so some expectations might have changed. The author pays more for rent and utilities due to their higher salary, and in return, the girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning. This seems like a mutual agreement they've had for two years. However, the girlfriend is now irritable, which might indicate that she's feeling overburdened or that the original arrangement isn't working anymore.\n\nFinancial contributions are a factor here. The author owns the house, so they might have a different sense of responsibility. But in a relationship, chores aren't just about money; they're about partnership and shared responsibility. Even if one person pays more, it doesn't necessarily mean the other has to take on more domestic work. Relationships often require an equal share of emotional labor and household chores, not just monetary contributions.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend's irritability could stem from unmet needs or expectations. Maybe she feels that her contributions aren't valued, or perhaps the division of labor is becoming unequal. The author's expectation that she should continue doing more because they pay more might be seen as transactional, which can strain a relationship. Emotional support and teamwork are crucial in partnerships.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. Traditionally, chores like cooking and cleaning have been assigned to women, but modern relationships often advocate for a more balanced approach. The fact that the author is questioning whether it's their fault suggests some self-awareness, but they might not see the transactional nature of the arrangement as problematic.\n\nMoreover, the author's reasoning is that since they pay more, the girlfriend should do more chores. This assumes a direct trade-off between money and labor, which might not account for the emotional and relational aspects. It's possible that the girlfriend feels her work is undervalued or that the chores are piling up beyond what's fair.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because expecting someone to do chores as a form of payment for their living expenses creates an imbalance. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and shared responsibilities, not a transactional setup. The irritability from the girlfriend could be a sign that the current arrangement is unfair, and the author needs to reassess how they're contributing beyond just financially.\n"
