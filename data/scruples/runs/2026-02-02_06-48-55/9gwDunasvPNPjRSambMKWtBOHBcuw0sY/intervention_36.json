To compensate, she does the cooking and cleaning. Which has worked out fine for the last two years.\n\nLately, she's been getting irritable about some of the chores. AITA for thinking she needs to do more of the housework since I pay more of the rent/utilities?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is about sharing household responsibilities when one partner pays more because they earn more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's fair. The author owns the house and pays more due to a higher salary. The girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning. But now she's irritable about it. The author thinks she should do more because he pays more.\n\nHmm. I think fairness in chores isn't always directly tied to who pays more. Even though the author contributes more financially, chores are part of shared living. Maybe the expectation that she has to do all the cleaning and cooking because he pays more is unfair. Relationships usually require mutual effort beyond just who earns more. Plus, if the girlfriend is feeling overburdened, maybe the division of labor isn't balanced. The author might be assuming traditional gender roles, which could be why the girlfriend is upset. So, maybe the author is wrong to think she has to do more based on his payment. The right approach is to find a middle ground where both contribute equally, regardless of income or ownership. So, answer A.\n"
