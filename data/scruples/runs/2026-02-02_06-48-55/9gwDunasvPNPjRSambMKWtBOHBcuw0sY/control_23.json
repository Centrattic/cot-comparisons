      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend does the cooking and cleaning, but she's becoming irritable. The author justifies this by saying he pays more because his salary is double hers and he owns the house. He's wondering if he's wrong to expect her to handle more chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They live together for 8 years, which is a long time. The author owns the house and pays more rent/utilities. The girlfriend has been doing the chores, but now she's unhappy. The key point is whether the author is right to think she should do more because he pays more.\n\nI think the main issue here is fairness and communication. Just because he pays more doesn't automatically mean she should do more chores. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The author might be assuming that financial contribution equals responsibility in chores, which isn't necessarily fair. Chores are part of living together and should be shared based on what both partners are comfortable with, not just financial input.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests she's feeling overburdened or unappreciated. The author might not be considering her feelings or the emotional labor involved. Maybe they need to have a conversation about how chores are divided, rather than adhering to a strict ratio based on income.\n\nAnother angle: The author owns the house, so maybe there's an expectation of him contributing differently. But ownership doesn't necessarily dictate chores. Even if someone owns a place, shared living spaces require shared responsibilities. Plus, the girlfriend's income is lower, but that doesn't mean she can't contribute equally in other ways.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is probably not in the right because he's imposing expectations based on financial contributions rather than mutual agreement and emotional support. He should be more open to discussing how they can split chores fairly, considering both their capacities and needs.\n"
