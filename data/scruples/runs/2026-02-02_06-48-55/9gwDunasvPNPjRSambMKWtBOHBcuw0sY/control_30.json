      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting his girlfriend to do the cooking and cleaning because he pays more towards rent and utilities. They've been together 8 years, live together, and the house is in his name.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author assumes that since he contributes more financially, it's fair for her to handle the chores. But housework and chores aren't just about money. Relationships often require mutual effort and communication. The girlfriend is getting irritable, which suggests she might feel overburdened or that the arrangement isn't fair anymore. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. The financial contribution ratio doesn't necessarily dictate the division of labor. Even if he pays more, it's a shared home, so responsibilities should be shared unless both agree otherwise.\n2. The girlfriend's irritation indicates a problem. The author might not be considering her feelings or workload. Maybe she's taking on more than she's comfortable with, or there's an imbalance he's not seeing.\n3. The length of the relationship (8 years) means expectations might have changed. What worked two years ago might not now. It's possible the girlfriend feels the arrangement is outdated or unfair as their lives evolve.\n4. The house is in his name, but they both live there, so ownership doesn't automatically mean he should bear all financial responsibility. However, he does contribute more, so maybe the expectation is that she takes on more chores as a form of contribution. But this could be seen as transactional, which might not be healthy.\n\nIn many relationships, emotional labor and physical labor are also considered. If she's doing all the cooking and cleaning, maybe she's also handling more emotional tasks. The author might be overlooking her contributions beyond just housework.\n\nThe question is whether it's fair to expect her to do more because he pays more. But fairness in relationships isn't just about splitting things proportionally. It's about mutual respect and understanding. If the girlfriend is unhappy, the author should communicate and adjust the arrangement rather than stick to an old understanding.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering her feelings and the current situation. The initial arrangement might have been okay, but if she's now irritable, it's time to reassess and find a balance that works for both, not just based on financial contributions.\n"
