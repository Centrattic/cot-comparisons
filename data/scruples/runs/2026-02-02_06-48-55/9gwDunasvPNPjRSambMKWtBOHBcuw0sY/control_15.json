      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning in their shared home. The situation is that they've been together for 8 years, live together, and he owns the house. His salary is twice hers, so he pays more towards rent/utilities. In return, she does the cooking and cleaning, which worked for two years. Lately, she's been getting irritable about the chores, and he's questioning if he's wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their partnership. The key points here are the financial contributions and the division of household labor. He owns the house and pays a larger share of the rent/utilities because he earns more. She, on the other hand, is handling the cooking and cleaning. The arrangement has been working for two years but now she's unhappy with the workload.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, there's often an expectation of shared responsibilities. While financial contributions can be a factor, it's not necessarily a direct trade-off for chores. The question is whether expecting her to do more housework based on his higher financial input is fair.\n\nHe mentions that she's been getting irritable. This could mean that the current division of labor is causing her stress or imbalance. Even if they had an unspoken agreement, maybe she's now feeling overburdened. It's possible that the chores have increased, or she's taking on more than she can handle, leading to her irritability.\n\nAnother angle is the length of the relationship. They've been together for 8 years, which is a significant time. Over time, people's needs and capacities can change. What worked two years ago might not be sustainable now. The fact that she's been complaining suggests that the current arrangement isn't meeting her needs anymore. The author might be resistant to adjusting the chores because he feels it's fair based on financial contributions, but fairness in relationships isn't always a one-size-fits-all equation.\n\nAlso, considering that he owns the house, there's a power dynamic here. He might feel more entitled to have her handle certain chores, but that could be contributing to the imbalance. It's important to note that in a healthy relationship, both partners should feel that their contributions are valued and that the workload is shared equitably, regardless of financial inputs.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. If they haven't discussed the division of chores explicitly, it's possible that there's been an unspoken agreement that's not aligned with current realities. The author might not realize that his expectations are causing her stress. It's essential for both partners to communicate their needs and adjust accordingly.\n\nIn terms of fairness, expecting someone to do chores simply because you pay more rent/utilities can be seen as transactional. Relationships thrive on mutual respect and consideration, not just a trade-off of resources. If the chores have become a source of tension, it's a sign that the current setup isn't working. The author might be in the wrong if he's not willing to adjust the division of labor to accommodate her feelings and capacity.\n\nMoreover, the fact that she's been irritable indicates that she's not happy with the arrangement. The author's perspective is that she should continue as before because he pays more, but her dissatisfaction suggests that the current setup is unfair from her viewpoint. It's possible that the chores are more time-consuming than he realizes, or she has other responsibilities that haven't been considered.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's reasoning is based on financial contributions, the key issue here is the emotional and physical well-being of both partners. Relationships require flexibility and empathy. If the chores are causing her stress, it's important to reassess the division of labor, perhaps by sharing more equally or finding a compromise. The author might be in the wrong if he's not open to adjusting the chores to maintain a harmonious relationship.\n"
