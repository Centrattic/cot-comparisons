      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to do more chores because they pay more rent and utilities.\n\nFirst, the relationship has been going on for 8 years, and they live together. The author owns the house and earns twice as much as their girlfriend. They've had a setup where she does the cooking and cleaning, which has worked for two years. Now she's getting irritable about it. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong for expecting her to do more.\n\nHmm, in relationships, fairness isn't just about splitting chores based on income or who owns the house. It's more about mutual respect and understanding each other's contributions. Even though the author pays more, household chores aren't typically calculated in monetary terms. Expecting someone to do more because they earn less might come off as unfair or transactional. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests she might feel overburdened or unappreciated. The author's approach assumes that financial contribution directly translates to housework responsibility, which isn't a standard expectation. Relationships usually require flexibility and communication. If the author hasn't discussed this with her, maybe he's not considering her feelings or the balance of their contributions beyond just money. \n\nSo, the key points are: the arrangement might be seen as unequal in non-monetary terms, lack of communication, and not accounting for emotional labor. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not addressing her feelings or adjusting the chores fairly.\n"
