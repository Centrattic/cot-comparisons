      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning because he pays more of the rent and utilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together 8 years and live together. The author owns the house, and his salary is double his girlfriend's. He pays more towards rent and utilities, so she handles the cooking and cleaning. Recently, she's been getting irritable about chores.\n\nThe key points here are financial contributions versus domestic responsibilities. The author believes that since he's contributing more financially, she should take on more chores. But is that a fair assumption?\n\nI think the issue is about fairness and communication. Just because someone pays more bills doesn't automatically mean they shouldn't also do more chores. Housework isn't something that can be strictly divided by income. It's a shared responsibility in a household. The author might be viewing the relationship like a business arrangement, which could be problematic. Relationships are based on mutual respect and cooperation, not a transactional balance sheet.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's irritability suggests that the current division of labor isn't working for her. Maybe she feels like she's carrying an unequal burden, even if she's doing the cooking and cleaning. The author should consider her feelings and maybe discuss a more balanced approach. Assuming that financial contribution justifies more chores might be unfair because it doesn't account for other factors, like time, energy, and personal preferences.\n\nAnother angle: the length of the relationship (8 years) implies they should have established a routine that works for both. If she's now getting irritable, maybe the division needs to be revisited. The author's expectation seems to be based on a transactional view, which might not be healthy. Relationships require empathy and adaptability. The author might need to step back and realize that fairness isn't just about money but about mutual effort and understanding.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because expecting her to do more chores solely based on his higher income is transactional and doesn't consider emotional labor or mutual agreement. They should talk and find a fair balance that works for both, rather than assigning chores based on income.\n"
