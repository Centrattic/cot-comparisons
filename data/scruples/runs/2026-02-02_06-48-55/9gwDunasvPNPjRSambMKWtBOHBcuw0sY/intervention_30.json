      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting their girlfriend to handle cooking and cleaning. The setup is that they've been together 8 years, live together, he owns the house, his salary is double hers, and they've had a system where he pays more for rent/utilities and she does the chores. Now she's getting irritable, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for expecting her to keep doing the housework.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the arrangement. He pays more because his income is higher. But housework isn't something that's directly tied to income. Traditional roles might suggest that whoever earns more contributes more financially, but housework is more about shared living. \n\nThe fact that they've been fine for two years but now she's getting irritable might indicate that the balance is shifting. Maybe she's feeling overburdened or that the arrangement isn't fair anymore. The key point here is whether expecting her to do all the cooking and cleaning is fair, especially since they live together as a couple. \n\nIn modern relationships, many people advocate for an equal sharing of household responsibilities, regardless of income. So even if he pays more, the chores should be split equally. If he's not contributing, that could lead to resentment. The author might be assuming that because he's paying more, she should do more work, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlso, the fact that the house is in his name might add to the complexity. He's the one who owns it, so maybe he feels more entitled to certain comforts, but again, housework is a shared responsibility. The income difference shouldn't translate to unequal division of labor in the home. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's expecting her to take on all the domestic work despite living together. It's about mutual effort and respect. Even if their financial contributions differ, the chores should be shared. His belief that she needs to do more because he pays more is likely the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
