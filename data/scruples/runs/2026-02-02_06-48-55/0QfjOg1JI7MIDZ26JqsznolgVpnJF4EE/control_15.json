For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother being a teenager when he had a kid, then neglecting the child after a breakup. The parents are now taking care of the child, but there are issues like swearing in front of the kid, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the ex is using the child as leverage. The author reported this to CPS, leading to family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical obligations. In many places, there are mandatory reporting laws where anyone who suspects child neglect or abuse should report it. The author might be fulfilling a legal duty here. From an ethical standpoint, the child's well-being is the priority. If the parents and brother are neglecting the child, reporting might be the right choice to protect the child.\n\nHowever, the family dynamics complicate things. The brother is upset, and the author didn't inform the father immediately, which might have caused more conflict. But the father was involved in the discussion, so maybe the author thought it was the right step. The key points are whether the neglect is significant enough for CPS intervention and if the author acted in the child's best interest.\n\nThe neglect described\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, swearing\u2014could be signs of neglect. CPS stepping in is a standard response. The author might not be in the wrong because their action could prevent further harm. However, some might argue that the family should handle it internally first. But given the severity and the potential risk to the child, the author's choice might be justified. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
