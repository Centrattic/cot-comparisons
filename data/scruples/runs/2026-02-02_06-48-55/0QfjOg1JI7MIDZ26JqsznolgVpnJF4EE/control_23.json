For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a father after a breakup, and now he's neglecting the child. The ex is also acting irresponsibly, leaving the kid unattended and using her as leverage. The author's parents are now taking care of the child, but the brother isn't helping much. The author reported the neglect to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child neglect is a serious issue. Leaving a child unattended, exposing them to swearing, and injuries are signs of neglect. CPS exists to protect children in such situations. The author's intent was to protect the 16-month-old, which is a valid concern. Legally, anyone can report suspected child abuse or neglect without needing to be a family member, and they're protected from retaliation (though sometimes it happens).\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, intentionally reporting neglect to CPS is generally the right thing to do. However, there might be nuances. Did the author have enough evidence? The post mentions specific instances like leaving the child in a playpen for hours, injuries, and neglect. Those could be valid reasons for a report. Also, the brother's behavior post-breakup and the mother's actions contribute to the neglectful environment.\n\nAnother angle is the family dynamics. The author might have felt responsible, especially if the parents are stepping in. But the brother was an adult when he became a parent, so the responsibility is on him. However, the author's decision to report without discussing it more with the family could cause tension. But the main goal was to protect the child.\n\nThe brother is upset because he's losing custody, but if CPS is involved, that's a necessary step if the child is at risk. The author might not be in the wrong because their intent was to protect the child. However, some might argue that they should have tried to resolve it within the family first. But if the neglect is ongoing and harmful, CPS involvement is appropriate.\n\nSo the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). They acted to protect a child from neglect, which is a valid and responsible action. The brother's anger doesn't negate the necessity of the report.\n"
