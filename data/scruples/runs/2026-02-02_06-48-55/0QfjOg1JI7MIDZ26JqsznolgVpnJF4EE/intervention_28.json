For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author reported their brother to Child Protective Services because they believe he's neglecting his child. The brother had a kid at 17, and there's a lot of conflict between him and the baby momma, leading to the child being left unattended, exposed to swearing, and even getting injured. The parents are now taking over most of the parenting, and the brother isn't helping.\n\nThe author's main concern is whether reporting their brother was the right thing to do. They mention that CPS has intervened, and the brother is upset, blaming their dad. The author is also considering whether they're in the wrong for not revealing they were the one who reported it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporting laws require people to report suspected child abuse or neglect. If the author is a family member, they might not be a mandatory reporter, but they still have the responsibility to protect the child's well-being. The situation described includes neglect\u2014leaving the child unattended, not supervising leading to injuries, exposing her to swearing. These are red flags for child neglect.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother is a minor (17 when the child was born, so he's still 18 or 19 now), and the mother is also unstable. The author's decision to report could be seen as trying to protect the child from a harmful environment. However, there's also the aspect of family loyalty. The brother might feel betrayed, and the author might have caused family tension by going to CPS.\n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the child is in immediate danger, then reporting is the right action. Neglect can have long-term effects on a child's development, so intervening could be necessary. The author might have done the right thing to protect the child, even if it caused family conflict. However, some might argue that they should have tried to resolve the issue within the family first, like through counseling or support, rather than involving CPS.\n\nBut given the circumstances\u2014multiple incidents of neglect, the child being injured, and the parents already taking over care\u2014it seems like the author acted in the child's best interest. The brother's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't negate the potential harm to the child. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. They had a duty to protect the child, even if it meant making a difficult decision that strained family relations.\n"
