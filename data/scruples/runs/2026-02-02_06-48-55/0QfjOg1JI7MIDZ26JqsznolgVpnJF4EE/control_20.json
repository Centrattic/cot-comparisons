For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe brother had a kid at 17 with an unstable girl. They broke up, and both are neglecting the child. The mom stalks the brother, leaves the kid unattended, and they both use the child as ammunition in their fights. The parents are now taking over, but the brother isn't helping. The author reported this to CPS, which caused conflict because the brother thinks the dad did it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. Well, CPS is there to protect children from neglect and abuse. The situation described includes leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries from not supervision. Those are valid concerns. The author's action was to prevent harm to the child, which is a duty in many places. However, the brother is a minor (17 when the kid was born, now presumably older, but maybe still in his 20s?), so maybe there's a legal aspect. But the child's safety is the main point here.\n\nThe brother is upset, thinking the dad did it, but the author stayed quiet to avoid conflict. But the main issue is the child's wellbeing. Reporting CPS is a responsible action if there's credible evidence of neglect. The author might have done the right thing by intervening when the parents and brother weren't. So probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
