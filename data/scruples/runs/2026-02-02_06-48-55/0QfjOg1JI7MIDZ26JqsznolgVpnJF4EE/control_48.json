For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the person reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) because of neglect and instability in their brother's care of his child. The brother is 17, had a kid with an unstable girl, and after a breakup, both he and the mother are using the child to get back at each other. They're neglecting the kid\u2014swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, not watching her properly, leading to injuries. The parents are now taking care of the child, and the brother isn't helping. The person reports this to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking maybe their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, adults are mandated reporters if they suspect child abuse or neglect. So if the person is an adult and has witnessed neglect, they might have a legal duty to report. But the brother is an adult, so the child is his daughter. However, the child's well-being is the main concern here.\n\nThe neglect described includes leaving the child unattended, injuries from lack of supervision, and emotional harm from parental conflict. These are serious issues. If the person reported it to protect the child, that's a valid reason. On the other hand, the person stayed anonymous, which might have caused conflict in the family, but maybe they had a right to remain silent to avoid further conflict.\n\nBut is the person in the wrong? Well, the key points are: Did they have a legal obligation to report? Yes, if they are a mandated reporter. Did they act in the child's best interest? Yes, preventing neglect and ensuring the child's safety. However, maybe the person could have tried to resolve it within the family first, but given the severity, CPS involvement might be necessary. The brother is an adult, but his judgment is impaired due to youth and the unstable situation. The parents stepping in might be a temporary fix, but CPS stepping in could be necessary for the child's safety.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the person could have handled it differently, like speaking directly to the brother or the mother first. But if they were ineffective, then reporting is justified. The brother is upset, but the child's welfare is paramount. The person isn't in the wrong if their intent was to protect the child, even if it caused family issues.\n\nSo, based on the information, the person is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
