For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a father and is now not taking proper care of his daughter. The author reports this to Child Protective Services (CPS), leading to some conflict in the family. The question is whether the author is justified in their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the legal and ethical responsibilities regarding child welfare. In many places, there are mandatory reporting laws that require people to report suspected child abuse or neglect. If someone doesn't report, they might be legally liable. So, if the author witnessed neglect, like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries, then reporting could be their duty.\n\nThe brother is 17, which is an age where he might not be considered mature enough to handle parenting responsibilities. The author mentions that the parents are now taking over most of the duties, and the brother isn't contributing. The ex-girlfriend is also not a reliable parent, given the stalking and using the child as a weapon. \n\nThe author's reasons for reporting include neglect and potential harm to the child. CPS stepping in suggests that there were valid concerns. However, the brother is upset because he thinks the dad reported him, leading to family tension. The author stayed quiet about being the reporter, which might be a point of contention. But did they have a duty to report regardless of the family fallout?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried to address the issue within the family first, like encouraging the brother to seek help or suggesting counseling. But if the situation was already in a state of neglect and the child's safety was at risk, immediate action through CPS might be necessary.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong if they reported suspected abuse or neglect. Ethically, they might be right to prioritize the child's safety over family feelings. However, the decision to stay anonymous might complicate things, but that's their choice to protect the family from further conflict.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author likely did the right thing by reporting to protect the child. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
