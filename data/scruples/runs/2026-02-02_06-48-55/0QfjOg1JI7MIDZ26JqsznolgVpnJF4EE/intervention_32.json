For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother became a father at 17, and after a breakup with the mother, both are neglecting the child. They use the kid as leverage, don't supervise properly, leave her with a playpen, and there are injuries. The parents are now taking over, but the brother isn't helping. The author reported to CPS, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, you can report suspected child neglect or abuse to CPS as a mandatory reporter, even if you're a family member. So the act of reporting might be justified. But morally, it's a family conflict. The brother is a minor (17) and has a young child. The mother is also unstable. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a good motive.\n\nBut the brother might feel betrayed because a family member reported him. The question is whether the author overstepped. On one hand, the child's safety is paramount. On the other hand, maybe they could have tried other solutions first, like counseling or family intervention. However, the neglect described (leaving the child unattended, injuries, swearing in front of her) seems serious. CPS stepping in is appropriate in such cases.\n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable, but the author's action was to protect the child. So, the author might not be in the wrong. However, staying silent and not helping the child could be worse. The dilemma is between family loyalty and child welfare. In ethical terms, protecting a child from harm should take precedence. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
