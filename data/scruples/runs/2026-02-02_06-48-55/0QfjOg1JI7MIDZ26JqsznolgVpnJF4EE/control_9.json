For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation is that the brother, at 17, has a child and is neglecting the daughter with his ex. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping, and the ex is using the child as leverage. The author reported this to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The brother is a minor (17) when he had the child, which complicates things. The neglect includes leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries due to lack of supervision. The ex is also acting irresponsibly. The author, as a sibling, reported this to protect the child. \n\nCPS is supposed to step in when there's child neglect or abuse. The author's intention was to ensure the child's safety, which is a valid reason. However, the brother is a teenager, which might make the situation more sensitive. But the child's well-being should be the priority regardless. The author didn't reveal themselves, which is common in these cases to avoid retaliation. \n\nIs there a wrong here? If the author believed the child was in danger, reporting to CPS is the right action. The brother's reaction is a consequence, but the author isn't obligated to stay quiet if they think the child is at risk. The ex's behavior also contributes to the neglect. \n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the brother is young but could improve with support. The author might have exacerbated family conflict. However, the child's safety overrides family dynamics. CPS is there to handle such cases without family bias. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
