For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services. The situation involves the brother and the baby's mother both neglecting their child, leading to incidents like leaving the child unattended, exposing her to swearing, and even injuries. The author reported this to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral and ethical implications. The author's main concern is the child's well-being. The brother and the mother are clearly not fulfilling their parental duties, which is a serious issue. Reporting to CPS is a legal responsibility in many places, especially if a child is in danger. The author mentions specific neglectful behaviors that could harm the child, so their action might be justified as trying to protect the child.\n\nHowever, the brother's reaction and the family conflict are also important. The author chose not to inform the brother they were the one who reported, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the act of reporting itself. Legally, if there's reason to believe a child is being neglected, reporting is required. Ethically, it's about the duty to protect a vulnerable child versus family loyalty.\n\nThe brother's actions are harmful, so the author's intervention might be necessary. The fact that the parents have taken over most responsibilities doesn't negate the need for CPS involvement if the child is at risk. The author might not be in the wrong, but they might have a responsibility to consider how to handle the situation to minimize family conflict while ensuring the child's safety.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, mandatory reporting laws require individuals to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Since the author is not a professional, but they've observed neglect, their report could be legally justified. The brother's anger doesn't make the author right or wrong; it's about the child's welfare. Staying silent would mean not acting on known harm.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because their actions were aimed at protecting the child, which is a higher priority than family loyalty in this case.\n"
