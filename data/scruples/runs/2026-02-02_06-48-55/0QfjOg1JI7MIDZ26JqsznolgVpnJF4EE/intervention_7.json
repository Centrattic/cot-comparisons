For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to child protective services is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, and then both the mother and brother neglecting the child. The brother leaves the kid in a playpen while gaming, and there's swearing in front of her. The parents have taken over, but the author reported it to CPS, which caused family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The key points are the neglect described: leaving the child unattended, injuries from not supervision, and the parents using the child as a weapon in their conflicts. The author's intention was to protect the child from neglect. Legally, in many places, anyone can report suspected child abuse or neglect. So the act of reporting isn't inherently wrong if there's a genuine concern for the child's safety.\n\nThe brother is upset, but the author's motivation was to prevent harm to the child. The question is whether the author overstepped or if it's a responsible action. Since the neglect is present and the child's well-being is at risk, the author's report could be seen as necessary. However, some might argue that it caused family strife, but the primary duty is to protect the child. So the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
