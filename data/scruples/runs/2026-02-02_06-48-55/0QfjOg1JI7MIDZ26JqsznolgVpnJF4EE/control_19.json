For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother being a teenage dad who's neglecting his child, and the baby's mom isn't handling things well either. They're using the kid as a way to get back at each other, and there's been some neglect\u2014like swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, injuries from not supervision. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The author reported it to CPS, which caused family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's action was wrong. The key points are the child's safety and well-being. The neglect described\u2014leaving the child alone, injuries, swearing\u2014could be considered signs of neglect or harm. CPS is responsible for protecting children in such cases. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. However, the brother is their sibling, so there's a family conflict here.\n\nBut legally, if there's a suspicion of child neglect or abuse, anyone can report it to CPS, and they have a duty to investigate. The author didn't have to be the parent; they could still report if they believed the child was in danger. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't necessarily make the report wrong. The alternative is not reporting and allowing the child to remain in a harmful environment. So, the author's action was in the best interest of the child. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
