For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother, who was 17 when he had a kid, being neglectful and the baby momma being unstable. Both are using the child as leverage in their bitter breakup. The author decided to report the neglect, leading to CPS involvement and family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, reporting suspected child abuse or neglect is not just allowed but required. The person is a mandated reporter if they're in certain professions, but even if not, the law usually protects whistleblowers in these cases. The key here is whether the neglect is significant enough to warrant CPS intervention.\n\nThe details given include leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries from neglect, and the parents using the child as a weapon in their disputes. These are serious issues. Leaving a child unattended for hours, even if not extreme, can still be considered neglect. The injuries, even minor ones, when repeated, might add up. The parents are also not cooperating, which exacerbates the problem.\n\nThe author's brother is 17, which is a teenager himself. Parenting at such a young age is challenging, and without proper support, it's hard to provide adequate care. The fact that the other parent is also unstable and using the child for her own purposes (like taking Instagram pictures) adds another layer of concern.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did the right thing by reporting. The author's intent was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. However, the brother is upset, thinking it was their dad who reported. The author is also staying quiet about being the reporter, which might be seen as manipulative or causing family tension. But the main issue is the welfare of the child.\n\nLegally, the author is not in the wrong for reporting. It's their responsibility to ensure the child's safety. Ethically, it's a tough call. The author might have considered other options first, like involving other family members or community resources. But given the circumstances described, where the child is being harmed and the parents are uncooperative, reporting to CPS is justified.\n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't negate the need for the report. The author's silence about being the reporter could be seen as problematic, but the priority here is the child's well-being. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as they acted to protect the child, which is a legitimate concern, even if it caused family issues.\n"
