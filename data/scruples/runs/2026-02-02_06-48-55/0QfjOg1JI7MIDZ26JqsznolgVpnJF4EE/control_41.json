For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation is that the brother had a child at 17, had a bad breakup with the mother, and now both are neglecting the child. The author reported it after seeing neglect like swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, and injuries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, reporting suspected child neglect to CPS is a legal obligation, especially if the child is in danger. The writer might be acting in the best interest of the child. The brother and the mother are both involved in harmful behavior, so the writer's action could be justified as protecting the child.\n\nBut there's also the family dynamics. The brother is upset, thinking the dad did it, which is causing family issues. The writer is staying silent about their role, which might be causing distrust. However, the main question is whether reporting was wrong. If there's credible evidence of neglect, reporting is the right thing. CPS's job is to investigate, so even if the situation is messy, the intent was to help the child.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the writer should have tried to resolve it within the family first. But if the parents are already taking over parenting and the brother isn't helping, the writer might not have other options. Also, leaving a 16-month-old unattended and exposed to swearing can be considered neglectful, so it's important to report.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They acted to protect the child, even if it caused family conflict. Staying quiet was a choice to avoid further tension, but reporting was necessary for the child's safety.\n"
