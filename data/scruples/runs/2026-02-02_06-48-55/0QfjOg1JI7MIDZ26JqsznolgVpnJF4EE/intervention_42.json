For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who's a dad, and there's neglect happening with the child. The author reports to CPS, leading to family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporting laws require certain people to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Even if the person isn't a mandatory reporter, they might still have a moral obligation if they see a child in danger. The brother is 17, so he's a minor himself, which complicates things. The mother is also unstable, and there are instances of neglect like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. \n\nThe author's actions are based on concern for the child's safety. CPS is involved, and the brother is upset, thinking it's their dad. The question is whether the author was wrong to report. \n\nPossible angles: Did the author have enough evidence? The post mentions specific instances like the child being left in a playpen, injuries, and parents taking over. These seem like valid concerns. The brother is a minor, so maybe the family isn't equipped to handle parenting responsibilities. \n\nHowever, family dynamics can be sensitive. The author might have overstepped by not trying to resolve the issue within the family first. But given the neglect and potential harm to the child, reporting could be justified. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants to know. I need to decide if the author's actions are justified. Since the child's safety is at risk, reporting to CPS is likely the right move. The brother's reaction is problematic, but if the author is protecting a child from harm, they're in the right. So answer B.\n"
