For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who had a kid with an unstable girl, and after a breakup, both parents are neglecting the child. The author reported the neglect to CPS, which led to their brother being upset and the family dynamic getting tense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, you're required to report it to authorities. The author mentions neglect like swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the baby's mom using the child for selfies. These could be signs of neglect or harm. So legally, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nThen, the moral aspect. The brother isn't taking his parental responsibilities seriously, which is concerning. The author is trying to protect the child's well-being. Even though it's family, the child's safety is paramount. The brother's anger could be because he's upset about the consequences, not necessarily because the author did something wrong. \n\nAlso, the author didn't take any action before reporting. They might have tried to talk to their parents first, but if that didn't work, CPS is a valid step. The alternative of staying silent could lead to more harm. So the author's choice to report might be justified. \n\nI should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The brother might feel betrayed, but the author's intent was to protect the child. The neglect is ongoing, and the parents are involved, so the report isn't just about one parent. The author might have had to stay quiet initially to avoid family conflict, but once it escalated, reporting was necessary. \n\nSo the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect the child, which is a priority over family loyalty in this case.\n"
