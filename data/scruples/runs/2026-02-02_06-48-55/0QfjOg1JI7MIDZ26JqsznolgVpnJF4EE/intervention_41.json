For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child with a girl he later had a bad breakup with. They both neglect the child, and the parents are now taking over. The author reports this to CPS, which causes conflict in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, you are not only allowed but sometimes required to report it to authorities like CPS. So from a legal standpoint, the author might not be in the wrong because they're fulfilling a duty to protect a child.\n\nEthically, the situation is trickier. The brother's actions are neglectful, and the child's safety is compromised. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. However, family dynamics can be complex. The author might have considered other options, like trying to mediate or get help before reporting, but sometimes when neglect is ongoing and immediate, reporting is necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by not discussing it more within the family first or giving the brother a chance to improve. But given the severity of the neglect\u2014leaving the child unattended, not providing supervision leading to injuries\u2014it's a serious matter that CPS is designed to handle.\n\nThe brother's reaction adds another layer. He's upset, and the author didn't disclose being the reporter. But the main question is whether the act of reporting was wrong. Since the child's well-being is at stake, the author's actions were likely justified.\n\nSo considering the legal duty, the child's safety, and the severity of the neglect, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). The author acted to protect a vulnerable child, which aligns with societal and legal expectations.\n"
