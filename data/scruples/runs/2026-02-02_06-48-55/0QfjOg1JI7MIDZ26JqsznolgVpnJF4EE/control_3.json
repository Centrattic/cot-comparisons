For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother had a baby at 17, and now he and the mother are neglecting the child. They're using the kid as ammunition in their bitter breakup. The mother stalks the brother, drops off the kid unexpectedly, and there's neglect like swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, injuries from not supervision. The parents are now taking over most of the parenting, and the brother isn't helping. The author reported to CPS, and now the brother is upset, blaming the dad.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider the ethics and legality here. Reporting child neglect is a legal right and duty in many places. If a child is in danger, reporting it is the responsible thing to do. The author's actions were to protect the child, which seems justified. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The brother might feel betrayed, but the child's safety is paramount.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe they should have tried to help the brother fix the situation first, but given the ongoing neglect and the child's safety, it's not just about helping the brother. Also, the brother isn't stepping up, so the author might have felt it was necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't stay silent when there was clear neglect. The CPS intervention is for the child's benefit. While the brother is upset, the child's well-being is more important. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. They might have handled the communication with the family differently, but the action itself is justified.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
