For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author reported their brother to child protective services (CPS) because they were concerned about their niece's well-being. The brother had a kid at 17, and after a breakup, both he and the mother are neglecting the child. There are issues like leaving the kid unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries from not supervision, and using her as a way to get back at each other. The parents have taken over most of the parenting, but the brother isn't helping. The author stepped in and reported it to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities and the legal/ethical aspects. In many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, it's actually your legal duty to report it. So the author might be doing the right thing by reporting. But then again, the brother is the parent, and maybe the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first? But the situation seems pretty bad\u2014leaving a 16-month-old in a playpen while gaming for hours, injuries, and constant conflict between the parents. That could be considered neglect, which CPS is there to handle. \n\nThe brother is upset, but the author's intention was to protect the child. Even though it caused family tension, the well-being of the child is a priority. The author might not be in the wrong here. Also, the question is whether they should have stayed quiet. If they didn't report, the child might have continued to be neglected. So maybe not being in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, if the author had a vendetta against the brother, but the story says they were concerned. So no, the author is probably in the right.\n"
