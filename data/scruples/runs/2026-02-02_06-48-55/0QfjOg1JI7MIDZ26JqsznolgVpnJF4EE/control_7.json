For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother's daughter being neglected after a bitter breakup. The brother is 17 and not stepping up, while the baby momma is using the child as leverage. The parents are now taking care of the kid, and the author reported it to CPS.\n\nFirst, the key points: the child's well-being is at risk. There's neglect like swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, injuries. CPS is there to protect children, so reporting is their job. The brother is a minor (17) and not handling responsibilities. The author's actions were to protect the child. The brother is upset because he blames their dad, but the author didn't reveal themselves. \n\nNow, considering the options. If the author is in the wrong (A), maybe they overstepped, but given the neglect, it's a duty to report. If not in the wrong (B), then it's justified. The brother's actions are harmful, and CPS intervention is necessary. The author's silence about their role might be an issue, but the main act of reporting is correct. So the answer is B.\n"
