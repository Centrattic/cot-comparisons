For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. So the situation is that the brother had a kid at 17, and after a breakup with the mother, they both became neglectful. The author mentions specific issues like swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the parents taking over. The brother isn't helping, and the mother uses the kid for social media. The author reported to CPS, which caused conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child Protective Services exists to ensure children's safety. If a child is being neglected, reporting it is usually a responsibility. The examples given\u2014leaving the kid unattended, injuries, not providing proper supervision\u2014are signs of neglect. The author might feel they had a duty to act to protect the child.\n\nBut then, there's the family dynamics. The brother is 17, which is a tough age. The author's motivation could be concern for the child's well-being versus interfering in family matters. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key is whether their actions were justified. Since the child's safety is at risk, reporting it might be the right thing. Also, the brother is not fulfilling his responsibilities, and the mother is using the child as a weapon, which adds to the concern.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author shouldn't have stepped in without trying to resolve it within the family first. But given the severity of the neglect and potential harm to the child, CPS involvement is necessary. The author's action was to protect the child, which is typically seen as responsible. The brother's reaction, feeling betrayed, is a family conflict, but the child's welfare comes first.\n\nSo, based on the details provided, the author's action seems justified. Therefore, they're not in the wrong.\n"
