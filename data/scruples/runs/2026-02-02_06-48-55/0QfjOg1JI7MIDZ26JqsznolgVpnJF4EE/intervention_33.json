For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) because of neglect towards their niece. The brother had a child at 17, which already puts him in a tough spot, but after a breakup, both him and the mother are using the child as a weapon. There are instances of the child being left unattended, exposed to swearing, and even injured. The parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, and the brother isn't helping. The author, after discussing with their dad, reported the situation to CPS. Now, the brother is upset and thinks the dad did it, causing family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporters (like teachers, social workers) have to report suspected child abuse or neglect. But the author is a sibling, not a mandatory reporter. However, they might feel a moral obligation to act. The question is whether their actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, the niece's safety is paramount. The described neglect\u2014leaving her unattended, injuries, exposure to swearing\u2014could be considered neglect under CPS definitions. Reporting could protect the child from further harm. The author might be trying to prevent the child from suffering, even if it causes family conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, reporting can have serious consequences. The brother might lose custody, face legal issues, or be stigmatized. The author's decision to stay silent about being the one who reported adds complexity. While they might have had good intentions, the secrecy could lead to betrayal feelings within the family. However, sometimes people choose anonymity to avoid conflict or protect themselves.\n\nIs there any indication that the author exaggerated or reported falsely? The post mentions specific instances, so it's hard to say. If the author genuinely believed there was neglect and reported in good faith, they might not be in the wrong. But if they overreacted or misjudged the situation, that's different.\n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable\u2014he's under a lot of stress. But as a parent, his actions are putting the child at risk. The author's intervention, while causing family strife, might be necessary. The key is whether the report was based on valid concerns. Since the child was already being left in dangerous situations, the report seems justified.\n\nSo, considering the potential harm to the child versus family dynamics, the author's action might be the right choice. They prioritized the child's well-being over family harmony, which is a heavy decision but possibly the correct one. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
