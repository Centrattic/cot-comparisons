For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The brother had a kid at 17, and the situation has deteriorated. Both the mother and the brother are being neglectful, leading to the child being left unattended, exposed to swearing, and even injured. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The author reported it, which caused conflict.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can report suspected child abuse or neglect without being a family member. So the act of reporting might be justified. But ethically and in terms of family dynamics, there's a lot to unpack. Did the author try to resolve it before reporting? They mention discussing it with their dad first, which might indicate they tried family intervention first. However, if the neglect continued, reporting could be necessary.\n\nThe brother is upset, thinking their dad did it. The author chose not to reveal themselves, which might add to the tension. But was the report warranted? The neglect described\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, and exposure to swearing\u2014is serious. CPS involvement might be necessary to protect the child.\n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as not in the wrong because they prioritized the child's safety. However, some might argue that family matters should be handled within the family first. But given the severity of the neglect, the author might be justified. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
