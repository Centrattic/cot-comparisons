For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, ongoing conflict with the mother, and now neglect issues. The author reported it after seeing neglect like swearing in front of the kid, leaving her unattended, and injuries. The parents are now handling most of the parenting, and the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporters (like teachers, doctors) have to report child neglect or abuse. But the author isn't mentioned as one of those, so maybe that's not their role. However, even non-mandated individuals can report if they believe a child is in danger. The author's intent here is to protect the child, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut wait, the brother is an adult, even though he's 17. Wait, the brother is 17 now? Wait, he had a kid at 17. Now he's still 17? Or maybe he's older now. The question doesn't specify his current age. If he's still a minor, then he might not be the legal guardian. The baby momma is the mother, but they're both neglecting the child. So CPS involvement is because of the child's safety.\n\nThe author reports to CPS, which is within their rights if they genuinely believe the child is in harm's way. However, the brother is upset and blames the dad. The author chose not to reveal themselves, which might have caused more tension. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, protecting a child is a priority. On the other, maybe the author should have tried to help the brother resolve the situation without involving CPS, like family support or other resources. But if the neglect is severe enough, reporting is necessary. The author might have acted out of care for the child, which is a good motive. However, the brother might feel betrayed. But the child's well-being is paramount. So likely, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
