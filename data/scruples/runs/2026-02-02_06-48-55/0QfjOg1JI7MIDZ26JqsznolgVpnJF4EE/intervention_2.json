For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a father and is now struggling with the baby mom, leading to neglect of the child. The author reported the neglect to CPS, which caused family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporting laws require individuals to report suspected child abuse or neglect. If the author witnessed neglect\u2014like leaving the child unattended, injuries, and exposure to swearing\u2014they might have a legal duty to report. Ethically, protecting the child's well-being is paramount, even if it strains family relationships.\n\nHowever, there's nuance. The brother is 17, which is a young age, and the situation might involve complex family dynamics. The author's decision to stay anonymous initially adds another layer. If the brother is a minor, there might be considerations about parental rights versus the child's safety. Also, the author's parents are stepping in, so maybe the family was already trying to handle it without external intervention. But the author's actions led to CPS involvement, which the brother is upset about. \n\nI should weigh the potential harm of not reporting against the family conflict caused by reporting. Child neglect is serious, and the signs mentioned (injuries, neglect) are concerning. The author's intent was to help the child, which is a strong ethical point. On the other hand, the brother might feel betrayed, but the author's responsibility is to the child's safety. The answer likely depends on the specific laws and the severity of the neglect. Since the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, I need to consider if that's the case. But given the described neglect, I think the author did the right thing. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
