For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about their younger brother becoming a parent at 17, and now there's a lot of conflict with the baby's mother. Both parents are neglecting the child, leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and using her as a weapon in their fights. The author reported this to Child Protective Services (CPS), and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporting laws require people to report suspected child abuse or neglect. If the author is a mandatory reporter (like a teacher, healthcare worker, etc.), they might be legally obligated. But even if they aren't, reporting suspected neglect could be seen as a responsible action to protect the child.\n\nThe brother is being neglectful, and the baby's mother is also acting irresponsibly. The child is being harmed\u2014left unattended, injured, exposed to swearing. The parents are using the child against each other, which is definitely not in the child's best interest. The author's parents have taken over most parenting duties, and the brother isn't contributing. The mother seems to use the child for social media, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nThe author's decision to report to CPS was to protect the child. Even though the brother is upset and the family is in turmoil, the main issue is the child's well-being. If there's credible evidence of neglect, reporting is the right thing to do. However, the author didn't disclose that they were the one who reported it, which might add some tension within the family. But staying silent in the face of potential harm could be considered inaction that harms the child.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions were likely in the best interest of the child. While it's causing family conflict, the primary responsibility is to ensure the child is safe. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
