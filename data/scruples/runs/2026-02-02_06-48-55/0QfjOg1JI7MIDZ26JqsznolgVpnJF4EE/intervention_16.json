For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS). The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, then neglecting the daughter after a breakup with the mother. The author reports the neglect, leading to CPS intervention and causing family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The brother is a minor (17 years old) when he had a child, which in many places means he's legally a parent but very young. The main issues are neglect: swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, playpen for hours, and injuries. The parents are taking over parenting, and the baby momma uses the child for Instagram and to mess with the brother. The author reports to CPS, which causes family tension because the brother blames the dad, and the author remains silent about being the one who reported.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the author is aware of child neglect and reports it, they might be doing the right thing. In many jurisdictions, it's actually a legal obligation to report suspected child abuse or neglect if you're a mandated reporter, but even if not, individuals can report anonymously. The well-being of the child is paramount, and if there are credible concerns about harm, reporting is often seen as responsible.\n\nHowever, the emotional and family dynamics are important too. The brother is young and possibly unprepared, and the author's actions might be seen as overstepping if they're not a legal guardian. The brother's reaction (losing it on the family) and the existing family conflict could be factors. But the author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. The fact that they didn't report immediately but waited until talking to their dad suggests some consideration, though the dad's role isn't clear here. The brother's negligence is causing the child to be harmed, so the author's intervention might be necessary.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: They might be causing unnecessary harm to their family, especially the brother, who is already struggling. The brother could be resisting help, and the author's report might be seen as a betrayal, especially if they didn't communicate it to him first. Also, the mother's behavior is part of the problem, but the author focused on the brother's actions. However, the author's primary responsibility is to the child's safety, and sometimes that means difficult decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is not the parent, but if they're in a position to know about the neglect and have the means to report it, they might be justified. The alternative of staying silent could leave the child in a harmful situation. The brother's age and inexperience could be contributing to the neglect, but that doesn't excuse it. The fact that both parents and the mother are not adequately caring for the child is a red flag. \n\nSo, in most cases, reporting child neglect is a responsible action, even if it causes family strife. The author's decision to prioritize the child's safety over family harmony might be seen as right, so the answer is B. The \"in the wrong\" part would be if the report was malicious or without cause, but the described incidents suggest neglect. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting.\n"
