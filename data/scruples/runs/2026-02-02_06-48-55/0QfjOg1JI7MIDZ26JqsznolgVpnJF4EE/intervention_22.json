For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the brother is 17 when he has a kid. The parents are unstable, and there's a lot of conflict between them, leading to neglect of the child. The author mentions things like swearing in front of the kid, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the parents not helping with childcare. The parents (the author's parents) have taken over, and the brother isn't contributing. The author, after discussing with their dad, decides to report to CPS. Now the brother is upset and there's family tension.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, you can report suspected child abuse or neglect anonymously to CPS. The goal is to protect the child, even if the parents are family. The brother's actions, like leaving the child unattended and the mom using the kid as leverage, do seem neglectful. The author's intent was to help the child, not just to meddle. However, the brother might feel betrayed, but the child's safety is a priority.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried other solutions first, like more direct intervention or working with family members. But given the severity of the neglect and the immediate risk to the child, reporting seems justified. The author isn't in a position to handle it alone, especially since the parents are already involved but not resolving it. So, even though the brother is family, the child's well-being comes first. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
