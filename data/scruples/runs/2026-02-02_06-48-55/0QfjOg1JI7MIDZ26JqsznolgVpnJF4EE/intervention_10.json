For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother being a minor parent with a daughter, and there's neglect happening. The brother and the baby's mother are using the child as a weapon against each other, leading to the child being left unattended, exposed to swearing, and even injured. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The author reported it to CPS, which caused tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, there are mandatory reporting laws for child abuse or neglect. If the author is a mandated reporter (like a teacher, doctor, etc.), they might be legally required to report. But if not, they still have a moral obligation to protect a child. The key here is that the child is being harmed. Leaving a 16-month-old unattended is neglectful, and injuries from not supervision are serious. Swearing in front of her might not be the worst, but combined with other issues, it adds up.\n\nThe brother is 17, so a minor parent. In many states, minors cannot legally care for a child on their own, which could be another reason for CPS involvement. The author's actions could prevent harm to the child, so the intent is protective. However, the brother feels betrayed, and the author didn't disclose being the reporter, which might add to the conflict.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the neglect is real and the child is at risk, then reporting is the right thing. The brother's anger is understandable but doesn't negate the necessity of the report. The author might be seen as a whistleblower rather than an asshole. However, the way the report was handled (not disclosing) could be a point of contention. But the priority is the child's safety. So the answer would likely be B, not in the wrong.\n"
