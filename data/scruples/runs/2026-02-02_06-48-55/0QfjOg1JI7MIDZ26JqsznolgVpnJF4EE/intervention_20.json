For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother had a kid at 17 with a girl who isn't stable. They broke up, and now both parents are acting out. The mom is dropping the kid off in front of the cops, and the dad isn't helping. The daughter is being neglected\u2014left unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries from not being watched. The parents are more focused on using the kid as a weapon in their fights.\n\nThe author reports this to CPS, leading to intervention, but the brother is upset because he blames their dad. The question is whether the author is the asshole for reporting and/or for staying silent about it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the main issue here is neglect. If there's actual neglect happening, like the child being left alone, injured, or exposed to swearing, then reporting to CPS is a legal duty in some places. In many jurisdictions, anyone who suspects a child is being harmed can and should report it. The author might be a mandated reporter, but even if not, they have a moral obligation to protect the child.\n\nThe brother's reaction is anger, but if the child is in danger, the author did the right thing. The brother's actions (not helping, neglect) are the problem. The author isn't the one neglecting the kid; they tried to intervene. Also, CPS stepping in is a positive outcome to protect the child. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first. But if the family isn't acting, and the child's safety is at risk, waiting might endanger the kid. The author's priority is the child's well-being, which is valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They took action to protect a vulnerable child from neglect. The brother's anger is misplaced; the issue is his neglect, not the report. The author's silence might have been a mistake if they knew about the neglect and didn't act. But since they did act, the answer is B.\n"
