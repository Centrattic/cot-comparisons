For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The person's younger brother had a kid at 17 with a girl who's unstable. The brother was doing okay at first but after a breakup, both he and the mother are neglecting the child. They use the child as a weapon against each other. The mother drops the kid off unexpectedly, leading to police involvement. The brother is neglecting the child, leaving her alone, not supervising, leading to injuries. The parents are now taking care of the child, and the brother isn't helping. The author reported this to CPS, which caused conflict with the brother.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, there are mandatory reporting laws where if you suspect child neglect or abuse, you have a duty to report it. The author is an adult, so they might be a mandated reporter or just a concerned individual. The brother's actions\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries\u2014could be considered neglect under CPS standards. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to protect the child. However, the brother is their family member, and there might be tension in the family dynamics. But the primary concern here is the well-being of the child. If CPS is involved and taking steps to ensure the child's safety, the author's action could be justified. \n\nThe brother is upset because he feels the author betrayed him, but the author's responsibility is to the child. The author didn't inform the brother, which might be why he's angry. However, in situations where a child is in danger, remaining silent might not be acceptable. The author didn't just stay quiet; they took action. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author didn't give the brother a chance to improve, or the situation wasn't severe enough. But the examples given\u2014leaving the child in a playpen for hours, injuries, and the mother's erratic behavior\u2014do seem like signs of neglect. The parents' involvement is a mitigating factor, but the brother isn't contributing, so it's still a risk. \n\nI think the author acted in the child's best interest, so they're not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
