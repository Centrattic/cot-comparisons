For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who had a child with an unstable partner. They're both neglecting the child, with incidents like swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, and injuries. The parents are taking over, and the brother is upset because CPS got involved after the user reported it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporting laws require individuals to report suspected child neglect or abuse. If the user is in a state where they're a mandatory reporter (like in the U.S.), then they might be legally required to act. Even if they're not a mandatory reporter, the ethical obligation to protect a child from harm could be a strong argument for their action.\n\nThe brother's behavior\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, swearing\u2014does sound like neglect. The mother is also acting irresponsibly. The user's parents are stepping in, but the brother is uncooperative. The user, as a family member, might feel compelled to report to ensure the child's safety. However, the brother is upset, thinking their dad reported, and the user is now hiding that they did it.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? If the neglect is real and present, then reporting to CPS is a responsible action. However, maybe the user could have tried to intervene in other ways first. But given the severity of the neglect described, it's a tough call. The key factors here are the child's safety and the legal/ethical duty to report. If the user acted in good faith to protect the child, then they're not in the wrong. The brother's anger doesn't necessarily make the user at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
