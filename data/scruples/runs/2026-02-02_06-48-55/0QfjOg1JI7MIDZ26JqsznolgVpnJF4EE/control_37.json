For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for reporting their brother to CPS. Their brother became a father at 17 and now he's not taking care of his daughter properly. The baby's mom is also involved, and they're both neglecting the kid. The brother leaves her alone a lot, swears in front of her, and she's getting hurt. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The person reported to CPS, and now the brother is upset and thinks it was their dad.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The key points here are the neglect of the child. Leaving a 16-month-old unattended, not watching her leading to injuries, and the parents taking over. CPS exists to protect children from neglect and abuse. If there's evidence of neglect, reporting it is the responsible thing to do. The brother isn't fulfilling his duties, and the mother is using the child as a weapon. The author's intention was to protect the child, not just to meddle. Even though the brother is their sibling, the well-being of the child is paramount. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help the child. The answer should be B, No.\n"
