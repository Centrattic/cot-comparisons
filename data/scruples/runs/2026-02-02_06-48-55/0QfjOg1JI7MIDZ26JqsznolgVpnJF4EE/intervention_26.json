For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a child at 17, and now he's neglecting the child with the mother. The author reported it to CPS, and the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporters are required to report suspected child neglect or abuse. The author might be a mandatory reporter if they're a family member in some states, but I'm not sure about the exact laws here. Even if not, if someone suspects a child is in danger, they might have a moral obligation to act.\n\nThe situation describes neglect: swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries. That's concerning. The parents are taking over, but the brother isn't helping. The mother is also using the child for revenge. So the child's well-being is at risk.\n\nThe brother is upset because he was reported, but the author's intention was to protect the child. Reporting to CPS is a legally recognized way to address such issues. The brother's reaction is understandable, but the priority here is the child's safety.\n\nThe author didn't stay silent when there was clear neglect. They might feel guilty for causing family tension, but the alternative is risking the child's safety. The question is whether the action was justified. Since the child is being harmed, the author is likely not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
