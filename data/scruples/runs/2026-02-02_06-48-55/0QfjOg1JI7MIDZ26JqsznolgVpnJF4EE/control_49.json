For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services (CPS). The situation involves the brother having a child at 17 with an unstable partner, leading to neglect and the parents stepping in. The brother and the mother are using the child as a weapon in their conflict, and there are signs of neglect like swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, and injuries. The author reported this to CPS, which caused family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, if someone suspects child neglect or abuse, they have a duty to report it to authorities. The U.S., for example, has mandatory reporting laws where certain professionals must report, but many states also encourage any citizen to do so if they believe a child is in danger. The author is not a mandatory reporter, but their action is still within legal bounds if they genuinely believed the child was at risk.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The primary concern is the child's well-being. If the child is being neglected or harmed, the author's intervention might be justified to protect the child. The brother's actions\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, and the mother using the child for revenge\u2014could constitute neglect. The author's decision to report could be seen as a responsible action to ensure the child's safety.\n\nHowever, there's also the family dynamics aspect. The brother is upset because he feels betrayed, especially if the author didn't disclose their role. The author might have considered the child's safety over family relations, which is a tough choice. But is the author in the wrong for prioritizing the child? It's a balance between family loyalty and the child's welfare.\n\nPotential counterarguments: The author might not have enough evidence, or maybe the situation isn't as bad as described. But according to the story, there are multiple instances of neglect, and CPS has already stepped in, indicating there was enough to warrant investigation. The author's intent was to protect the child, which is a valid reason.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the author's action seems justified under the duty to protect a child from neglect. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
