For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the brother is 17 when he has a kid with an unstable girl. After a breakup, both parents are neglecting the child. The mother drops the kid off unexpectedly, and the brother isn't helping. The daughter is being left unattended, exposed to swearing, and has been injured. The parents have taken over, but the brother is doing nothing. The author reported it to CPS, causing family tension now.\n\nSo, the main question is whether reporting was the right thing. On one hand, the child is being neglected, which is a serious issue. CPS exists to protect children from harm. The author might be acting in the child's best interest. On the other hand, the author is part of the family, and reporting can cause a lot of conflict. But the key here is that the child's safety is at risk. The neglect described\u2014leaving the kid unattended, injuries, swearing\u2014could be signs of neglect or even abuse. \n\nThe brother is 17, which is an adult, but the child is 16 months old. The parents (the author's parents) are involved, taking over most duties. But the brother's behavior seems to be part of the problem. The author decided to report after talking to their dad. The dad might have supported it. The brother is upset, thinking the dad did it. The author is staying quiet about being the reporter, which might add to the family tension. \n\nBut the main ethical question is whether the child's safety justifies the report. If the neglect is real and the child is in danger, the author isn't in the wrong. CPS is meant to handle such cases. Even if the brother is upset, the priority is the child's well-being. The author might feel conflicted, but the action was to protect the child. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they acted to protect the child from neglect and potential harm.\n"
