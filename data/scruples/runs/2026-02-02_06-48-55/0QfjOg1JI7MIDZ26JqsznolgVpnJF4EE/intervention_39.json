For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a younger brother who had a child at 17, and now there's a lot of conflict between him and the baby's mother. The brother isn't taking care of the child properly, and the mother is using the child to get back at him. The author reported this to Child Protective Services (CPS), and now the brother is upset, blaming the dad instead. The author is wondering if they're the asshole for reporting or for keeping quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, if someone suspects a child is being neglected or abused, they are legally required to report it. The brother's actions\u2014like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries\u2014could be signs of neglect. The mother is also being irresponsible by dropping the child off in anger and using her as leverage. So, the author might be right to report because they're trying to protect the child's safety.\n\nBut then, maybe the author didn't give the brother a chance to fix things first? Like, did they approach him directly before involving CPS? If the author tried to intervene and failed, reporting might be justified. However, if they went straight to CPS without giving the brother any opportunity to address the issues, that could be seen as overstepping. But the story says the brother is \"super bitter\" and not helping, and the parents are taking over. The author might have felt there was no alternative to ensure the child's well-being.\n\nAlso, the brother's reaction is causing family problems. The author didn't reveal themselves, which could be a good choice to avoid family conflict. But is keeping quiet part of the problem? The question is whether the author is wrong for reporting or for staying silent. The key here is the child's safety. If there's actual neglect, then reporting is the right thing. The brother's age and the circumstances (17, unstable mother) might make him less equipped to handle parenting, which could justify CPS involvement.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is usurping the parents' role. However, the parents are already taking over most duties, so the author's report might not be the main issue. The main concern is the child's welfare. Since the author's action led to CPS stepping in, which is meant to protect children, the author is likely not in the wrong. The brother's neglect and the mother's behavior are the real problems here.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Reporting to CPS in cases of suspected child neglect is a responsible action, especially when the child's safety is at risk. The family's conflict and the brother's failure to provide proper care support the author's decision.\n"
