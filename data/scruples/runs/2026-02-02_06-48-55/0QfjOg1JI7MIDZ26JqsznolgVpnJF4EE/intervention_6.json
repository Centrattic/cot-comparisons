For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who's a father, and there's neglect happening with his child. The brother isn't helping, and the mother is using the child as a weapon. The author reported it, CPS got involved, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, there are mandatory child abuse reporting laws. If someone suspects neglect or abuse, they have a duty to report it. So if the author is a mandatory reporter (like a teacher or childcare worker), they're required to report. But if they're not, is it still their responsibility? Even if not mandatory, if someone knows about potential neglect, they might feel ethically obligated to act to protect the child.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author's parents are taking over parenting duties, which might be a good thing, but the brother is still not contributing. The baby's mother is using the child for Instagram and to harass the brother. The neglect mentioned includes leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries. These are signs of neglect that could justify CPS involvement.\n\nBut there's also the personal relationship aspect. Reporting a sibling could strain family ties. The brother is upset, thinking it was the father, but the author chose to stay quiet about who reported. That silence might be causing additional stress in the family.\n\nSo, the key points are: Is the author legally obligated to report? If not, was it the right ethical choice to protect the child despite family repercussions? The neglect is real and ongoing, which might support the author's decision. However, the brother's reaction and family fallout are also important. But the child's safety is paramount. Even if it's hard on the family, preventing harm to the child is a priority. So, legally and ethically, the author probably isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But maybe the user thinks the author should have tried another approach first. But given the situation, with the brother not stepping up and ongoing neglect, reporting seems necessary. The author isn't the asshole here.\n"
