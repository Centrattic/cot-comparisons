For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe brother became a father at 17, and after a breakup with the baby's mom, they're both neglecting the child. The mom does things like dropping the kid off suddenly and using her as leverage. The brother isn't helping, leaves the kid unattended, and there are incidents where the child gets injured. The parents are now taking over, and the brother's neglect is evident. The person reporting is the sibling, who went to CPS after discussing it with their dad. Now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it, and the reporter is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the safety and well-being of the child. The brother's actions\u2014leaving the kid alone, swearing in front of her, and the child getting hurt\u2014could be considered neglect. The mother's behavior is also problematic. The reporter's intent was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. However, family dynamics can complicate things. Reporting to CPS is a legal action intended to protect children from abuse or neglect. If there's evidence of neglect, then the report isn't unwarranted. But there's a question of whether the reporter could have handled it differently, like intervening more within the family first. However, given the severity of the neglect described, CPS involvement might be necessary. The brother's anger is understandable, but the child's safety is paramount. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the report was made to protect the child, which is the main concern. The brother's neglectful behavior justifies the report. The reporter isn't at fault for trying to ensure the child is safe, even if it caused family conflict.\n"
