For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother being a teen parent, having a breakup, and both parents neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping, the mother is using the child as a weapon, and there's neglect like swearing in front of the kid and leaving her unattended.\n\nThe user, the reporter, decided to call CPS after discussing with their dad. Now the brother is upset, thinks the dad did it, and there's family tension. The question is if the reporter is wrong for reporting, or for staying silent about being the one who did it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, any citizen can report suspected child neglect or abuse to CPS. So the act of reporting isn't illegal. The brother's actions\u2014leaving the child unattended, not providing proper care\u2014could indeed be considered neglect. The reporter's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern.\n\nNow, the ethical side. The brother is 17, which is a tough age to be a parent. The neglect described (leaving in playpens for hours, injuries, swearing) is concerning. The reporter might feel responsible as a sibling to step in, especially if the parents are already involved. However, the brother might feel betrayed by the report, which could strain family relationships further.\n\nIs the reporter in the wrong for staying silent? The brother is upset, but the reporter might have chosen not to reveal their role to avoid conflict, which is a common reaction. However, keeping the secret could lead to ongoing family issues if the brother blames someone else. But the original act of reporting seems justified given the child's safety.\n\nConsidering all factors, the reporter's primary duty is to the child's well-being. While it's hard on the family, their actions were aimed at protecting the child. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong). The key points are the neglectful behavior, the reporter's intent to help, and the legal right to report.\n"
