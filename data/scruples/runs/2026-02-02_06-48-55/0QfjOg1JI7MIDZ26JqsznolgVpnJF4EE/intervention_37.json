For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for reporting their 17-year-old brother to Child Protective Services (CPS). The brother had a kid with a girl who's described as \"relatively unstable,\" and after a breakup, both parents are neglecting the child. The author mentions incidents like swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, and injuries. The parents now take over most of the care, and the brother isn't helping. The baby's mother uses the child to mess with the brother, and the author decided to report this to CPS, leading to the brother being upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I know, CPS is meant to intervene when there's a risk of child neglect or abuse. The situation described includes neglect (leaving the child unattended, not watching her enough leading to injuries), and there's a 17-year-old parent, which might be a factor in their ability to care for a child. The author might be right to report if they believe the child's safety is at risk. However, sometimes people might use CPS for revenge or to interfere in family matters, but the post seems to focus on the child's well-being. The brother is acting out, and the author might have felt it necessary to protect the child. But maybe there are other factors, like if the author should have tried to resolve it through other means first, or if the brother's age alone is a valid reason for CPS involvement. However, in many places, a 17-year-old can be a legal parent if married or if the child is born out of wedlock, depending on the jurisdiction. Still, if the parents are neglecting the child, CPS involvement might be justified. The author's actions could be seen as protecting the child rather than being in the wrong. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. So, leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
