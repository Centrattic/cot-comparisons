For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to child protective services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a messy breakup with the mother, and both neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping around the house, and the mother is using the child as a weapon. The parents are now taking over parenting, and the brother is upset because he thinks his dad reported him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author did the right thing. The key points here are the neglect: swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries, and the parents taking over. The brother isn't contributing. The sister reported these issues to CPS, which is within their legal right since any concerned citizen can report child abuse or neglect. \n\nBut is there a moral or ethical issue? Well, the brother is a minor (17 when he had the child) and might be immature, but the sister is acting in the child's best interest. CPS's role is to protect children, so reporting could be justified. However, maybe there's a lack of communication or alternative solutions? The sister might have considered family counseling or involving other resources first. But given the severity of the neglect, like the child being injured, the sister might not have time to explore all other options. \n\nThe brother is upset, but the sister's action is to protect the child. The question is if she's in the wrong. Legally, she's not; it's a legal duty to report. Ethically, if the neglect is real, then she's not wrong. But if the report was malicious, then yes. The context suggests she's concerned and acted after talking to her dad. So the answer is B (not in the wrong). But need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. For example, maybe she could have handled it differently, but the core issue is child neglect. So the answer should be B.\n"
