For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides here.\n\nFirst, the situation: the brother had a child with an unstable partner at 17. They're in a bitter breakup, and both are neglecting the child in various ways\u2014swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, not supervising properly leading to injuries. The parents are now taking over most parenting duties. The author reported this to CPS, which led to CPS stepping in and the brother being upset, thinking the dad did it. The author is now being criticized for reporting and also for not disclosing they were the one who reported.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, the author's concern is for the child's well-being. Neglecting a child, especially a 16-month-old, is serious. Leaving them in a playpen for hours, not supervising, and exposing them to harmful environments can be signs of neglect. CPS is meant to protect children in such cases. So reporting could be justified as a protective measure.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's brother might feel betrayed. Family dynamics can be complex, and involving CPS can have significant consequences. The author might be seen as overstepping, especially if they're not a legal guardian. However, in many places, any person who suspects neglect or abuse can report to CPS without being in trouble. The law often protects reporters from retaliation.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of family relationships. The author might be causing family discord by choosing not to reveal themselves as the reporter, leading to suspicion and blame. The brother is upset, and the parents are involved. Not taking responsibility for the report could be seen as dishonest, even if the intent was good.\n\nHowever, the key here is the child's safety. If the neglect is real and ongoing, then reporting is the right action. The author's intent was to protect the child, which is a moral duty. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't negate the necessity of the report.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the author acted to prevent harm to a child, which is a valid and responsible action. The method of reporting might be a point of contention, but the intent was protective. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
