For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a father and is now neglecting the child due to a bitter relationship with the mother. The author reports their brother to CPS after witnessing neglect, leading to CPS intervention and family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporting laws require individuals to report suspected child abuse or neglect. If the author witnessed neglect, like leaving the child unattended or exposing her to swearing, they might be legally obligated to report it. So, from a legal standpoint, the author is probably not in the wrong.\n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. The brother is a minor (17) and a new parent, which complicates his ability to care for a child. However, the author's decision to report without trying to help the brother improve his situation first could be seen as harsh. Did they offer support before reporting? The narrative doesn't mention that. The brother's actions are harmful, but the author's approach might come off as a betrayal, especially within the family. The brother's frustration is understandable, as he's being targeted by CPS, which might affect his future.\n\nOn the other hand, the child's safety is paramount. If the neglect is real and the parents are failing, the author's report could be lifesaving. The question is whether the author had other options before reporting. Maybe involving the parents first, or trying to mediate between the parents and the brother. The fact that the parents are now taking over duties might be a positive outcome, but the brother's lack of help in the house suggests he's not contributing, which adds to the problem.\n\nThe key points are the legal duty to report, the severity of the neglect, and the potential consequences of not reporting. If the neglect is as described, the author's actions could be justified. However, the manner in which they kept their identity secret might exacerbate family tensions. The brother's reaction is part of the fallout, which is a valid concern for family dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have acted out of concern for the child's well-being, the ethical dilemma lies in how they handled it. Legally, they might be in the right, but ethically, there's room for debate about whether all possible support was given to the brother before reporting. However, given the circumstances described, the child's safety likely overrides the family conflict.\n"
