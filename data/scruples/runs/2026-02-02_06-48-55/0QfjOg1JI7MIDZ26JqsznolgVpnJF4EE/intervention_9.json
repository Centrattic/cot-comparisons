For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who's a father, and he's not handling parenting responsibilities. The ex is also neglecting the child. The author reports them, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, if someone has reason to believe a child is being neglected or abused, they have a legal duty to report it to authorities like CPS. So from a legal standpoint, the author might be doing the right thing by fulfilling that duty.\n\nEthically, it's a bit tricky. The brother is a minor himself, so his ability to care for a child is questionable. The author's parents are stepping in, but the neglect is still happening. The author might feel torn between family loyalty and the child's well-being. \n\nThe brother is upset because he feels betrayed, but the primary concern here is the safety and welfare of the 16-month-old. Leaving a child unattended, exposing them to swearing, and injuries are serious issues. CPS involvement could be necessary to protect the child.\n\nThe author didn't disclose their role, which adds to the brother's anger. But the original act of reporting to CPS was to protect the child, not to cause family conflict. The question is whether the ends justify the means. \n\nIn many cases, mandatory reporters are protected by law to encourage people to come forward without fear. So the author might be justified in their actions. However, the family dynamics are complex, and there's potential for the report to be seen as betrayal. \n\nBut the core issue is child neglect. If the author genuinely believed the child was in danger, then reporting is the right move. The answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the priority is the child's safety. The author isn't obligated to keep the child in a harmful environment just for family peace.\n"
