For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the brother had a kid at 17, went through a breakup with the mother, and both are neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping, leaving the kid unattended, swearing in front of her, and she's getting hurt. The parents are now taking over, and the author reported it to CPS. Now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it, causing family problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, mandatory reporters (like teachers, doctors) have to report suspected child abuse or neglect. But even if the person isn't a mandatory reporter, they might still have an ethical duty to protect a child. The situation described includes neglect: leaving the child unattended, not watching her leading to injuries, swearing in front of her. These are signs of neglect, which CPS is meant to address.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The brother is an adult, but a minor at 17 when his daughter was born, so he's still a teenager now (assuming a few years have passed). He's not handling parenting responsibilities, which is a big problem. The mother is also acting irresponsibly, using the child as leverage. The author's parents are stepping in, but maybe they need CPS to help enforce better care.\n\nThe author's actions: reporting to CPS. The key points here are whether the report was justified. If there's credible evidence of neglect, then reporting isn't in the wrong. The author lists specific instances: leaving in playpen for hours, injuries, not helping at home. Those are valid concerns. However, maybe the author could have tried other avenues first, like family intervention, counseling, or involving other relatives. But given that the parents are already involved and the situation isn't improving, CPS might be the right step.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother is an adult, so some might argue that the author shouldn't interfere without the parents' input. But since the parents are involved and the situation is deteriorating, the author's report could be seen as necessary to protect the child. Also, the brother is 17 when the child was born, so he's now maybe 19 or 20, but still young and possibly not equipped to handle the situation. The mother is unstable as well.\n\nThe ethical angle: preventing harm to the child versus family loyalty. The author chose to prioritize the child's safety over sparing the brother's feelings. Since the child is being harmed, the report is likely justified. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't outweigh the child's well-being.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe CPS is overstepping, or the author should have tried to help the brother instead. But the neglect is ongoing and severe enough that CPS involvement is necessary. The author's anonymity in the report might not matter as much, but staying silent after reporting could be seen as abandoning the brother, but the main issue is the child's safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect a vulnerable child from neglect. The answer should be B (No).\n"
