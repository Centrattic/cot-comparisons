For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a kid at 17 with an unstable girl, and now both parents are neglecting the child. They leave her alone, swear in front of her, and use her as a weapon in their arguments. The author's parents are now taking care of the child, and the author reported the situation to CPS. The brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author did the right thing. The main issue here is child neglect. Leaving a 16-month-old unattended, not supervising leading to injuries, and using the child as a pawn in their conflicts are serious issues. Child Protective Services (CPS) is meant to intervene in such cases to protect the child's welfare. \n\nThe author's intent was to report neglect and potential harm to the child. Even though the brother is a family member, the child's safety is paramount. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't negate the need to act if the child is at risk. The author didn't mention any malicious intent, just a concern for the child's well-being. \n\nHowever, there might be considerations about family dynamics and the brother's ability to improve. But given the described neglect, like leaving the child unattended and injuries, it crosses into actionable neglect. The author's choice to report could be seen as a responsible action to ensure the child is safe, even if it caused family conflict. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the priority is the child's safety. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
