For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a contentious relationship with the mother, and the child being neglected with various issues like swearing in front of her, being left unattended, and injuries. The author reported the incidents, leading to CPS involvement, and the brother is upset, thinking it was their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother is a minor (17) when the child was born, which in many jurisdictions means he's a minor parent, which can complicate things. The neglect described\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, swearing\u2014might be signs of child neglect. Reporting to CPS is a legal duty in some places if someone suspects abuse or neglect. However, the brother is still a minor, so there might be different considerations.\n\nThe author's actions are based on concern for the child's safety. CPS is there to protect children, so if there are credible signs of neglect, reporting could be justified. However, the brother's age and possible lack of resources might mean he needs support rather than punishment. The mother's behavior is also problematic, using the child as leverage.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the legal obligation to report suspected child abuse/neglect and the intentions behind the report. If the author genuinely believed the child was in danger, they might be justified. However, if the report was more about family intervention rather than immediate harm, it could be seen differently.\n\nIn many places, you are legally required to report if you suspect child abuse or neglect. The author might be fulfilling that duty. On the other hand, if the report caused family disruption without sufficient cause, maybe it's not justified.\n\nAlso, the brother is 17, so the author might have considered that he's underage and unable to properly care for a child, but that's a different issue. However, neglectful behavior, regardless of age, is a valid concern for CPS. The fact that the parents (the author's parents) are now taking over most of the parenting duties might indicate that the brother isn't capable, which is a red flag.\n\nThe author is staying silent about being the reporter, which might be causing family tension. But the main question is about the act of reporting itself. If the author had evidence of neglect and believed the child's safety was at risk, then reporting is the right action. The brother's reaction and the family dynamics are secondary to the child's well-being.\n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong because they acted to protect the child from neglect. The answer should be B.\n"
