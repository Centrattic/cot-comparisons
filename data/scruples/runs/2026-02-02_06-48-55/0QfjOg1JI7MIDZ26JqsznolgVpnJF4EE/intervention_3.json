For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother, who is 17, having a child with an unstable partner. They're in a bitter custody battle, and the child is being neglected in various ways. The author reports to CPS, leading to the brother being upset and blaming their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, you're legally required to report suspected child abuse or neglect. If the author witnessed neglect\u2014like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, the child getting injured\u2014it's their responsibility to report it. The brother is a minor himself (17), which might complicate things, but the child's safety is the priority.\n\nThe brother's actions clearly fall under neglect. Leaving a toddler in a playpen for hours, not supervising, and using the child as a weapon in a custody battle are serious issues. The mother's behavior is also problematic, like dropping off the child unannounced and causing disturbances. The parents stepping in to care for the child suggests the situation is dire.\n\nThe author's decision to report might have caused family tension, especially since the brother blames the dad. But the author's duty is to protect the child. Withholding the report could have led to further harm. The brother's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't negate the necessity of the report. The author didn't act out of malice but concern for the child's well-being. So, legally and ethically, the author is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
