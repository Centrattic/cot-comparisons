For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to child protective services is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a child when he was 17, there's been a bad breakup with the mother, both are neglecting the child, and the parents are stepping in. The author decided to report to CPS, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main question is whether the author's action was justified. The key points here are the neglect of a child. If a child is being neglected, then reporting to CPS is generally considered a responsible action to ensure the child's safety and well-being. The author mentions instances like swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, and injuries. Those are red flags for child neglect.\n\nHowever, the brother is a minor, which complicates things. The author might be in a family conflict, and the brother is upset because he feels betrayed. But the primary responsibility here is the child's welfare. CPS exists to investigate such cases, and mandated reporters (like teachers or healthcare workers) are required by law to report, but even for non-mandated reporters, it's a moral duty if they suspect neglect or abuse.\n\nAnother angle is the brother's age. He's 17 when the child was born, so he's a teenager. Teen parents often struggle, and the environment here seems chaotic. The author's parents are taking over, which might be a sign that the family is trying to protect the child. The author stepping in could be seen as going above and beyond to ensure the child's safety, even if it causes family tension.\n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable, but if the child is in danger, the author's action is justified. The alternative is staying silent and letting the child continue in a neglectful environment. The author might be seen as a whistleblower in this context, even if it's within the family.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
