For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. Let me start by going through the details again.\n\nThe brother had a kid at 17, and things went downhill after the breakup. The mother is dropping the kid off aggressively, and both parents are neglecting the child. The daughter is 16 months, so very young. The neglect includes swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, playpen for hours, and injuries. The parents (the author's parents) are taking over most of the parenting, but the brother isn't helping. The author reported this to CPS, which caused conflict in the family.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The question is whether the author did the right thing by reporting or if they're an asshole for it.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility: In many places, you're mandated to report child abuse or neglect. So if the author is a mandated reporter (like a teacher or healthcare worker), they have a legal duty. Even if not, as a family member, they might still be legally able to report, though there could be legal implications if the report is malicious. But here, the author seems concerned about real neglect.\n\nMoral aspect: The child's safety is paramount. If the parents are neglecting the child, then reporting could be seen as the right thing to protect the child. However, family dynamics are complex. The brother is young and might feel betrayed. The author is taking a side against their own family, which can be hurtful.\n\nPossible consequences: CPS involvement can be traumatic for the family, but it's intended to protect the child. The brother is upset, which is understandable, but the child's welfare is critical. The author's parents are already involved, but maybe they aren't doing enough, so the author took initiative.\n\nWas the author wrong? If the neglect is real, then reporting is justified. If the report is based on false information, then it's wrong. The question is whether the reported actions constitute neglect. Leaving a toddler in a playpen for hours without supervision, injuries, swearing in front of her\u2014those are red flags. CPS might see that as neglectful.\n\nBut the author didn't step in earlier. They say their parents are already helping, but maybe they took the step further because things were getting worse. The brother isn't contributing, and the mother is using the child for social media. So the author might feel responsible to protect the niece.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother is a minor himself (he's 17 when he had the child, now maybe a bit older, but still young). He might not be equipped to handle parenting, which led to the neglect. The author's action could be seen as overstepping, but given the child's safety, it's a tough call.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if the author is right about the neglect and acted in the child's best interest, they're not in the wrong. But if they're exaggerating or lying, then they are. The scenario doesn't suggest lies, so B (not in the wrong) makes sense. However, the user thought the author was in the wrong. Maybe they feel the author should have handled it within the family first. But sometimes, family isn't enough, and legal action is necessary. So I think the answer is B.\n"
