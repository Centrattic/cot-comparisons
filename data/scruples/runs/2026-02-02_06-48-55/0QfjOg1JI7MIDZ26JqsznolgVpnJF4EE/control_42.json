For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The question is whether they should be considered an asshole (AITA) for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's younger brother had a child at 17 with a girl who's unstable. After a breakup, they're using the child against each other. The mother drops the kid off aggressively, both are neglecting the child\u2014swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, injuries, etc. The parents are taking over, and the brother isn't helping. The author reported this to CPS, which caused tension in the family. The brother is upset, thinking the dad did it. The author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Reporting to CPS is typically done to protect a child from neglect or abuse. The described neglect includes leaving the child unattended, injuries, and inappropriate behavior around her. These are serious issues that CPS is meant to address. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, there's a family conflict here. The brother is upset, and the author is staying silent about being the one who reported. But the key point is whether the report was justified. Since there's evidence of neglect, the report seems appropriate. The author's actions were in the best interest of the child. The fact that the brother is losing it doesn't negate the need for the report. The author might feel conflicted, but the priority is the child's safety. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
