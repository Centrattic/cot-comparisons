For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a sibling who reported their 17-year-old brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) because he's not adequately caring for his child. The brother had a child with a girl who's also unstable, and after a breakup, they've been using the child as a weapon against each other. The mother has been dropping the kid off unexpectedly and even had to be removed by police. The brother neglects the child by leaving her in a playpen for hours, swearing in front of her, and not watching her, leading to injuries. The parents are now taking over, but the brother isn't helping, and the mother uses the kid for Instagram posts. The author reported this to CPS, which caused tension in the family.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The key points are the child's safety and well-being. The brother is a minor (17) when he had the child, and there's evidence of neglect, like leaving the child unattended, leading to injuries. The mother is also problematic. CPS exists to protect children from neglect and abuse. If the child is in a dangerous situation, reporting it is a legal duty in some places, especially if you're a mandated reporter (like a teacher, but the author is a sibling, so maybe not mandated). However, even non-mandated people can report if they suspect harm.\n\nThe brother's actions are neglectful, and the mother is not providing proper care either. The author's parents are stepping in, but that doesn't necessarily mean the situation is safe enough. The fact that the child has been injured multiple times is a red flag. Reporting to CPS is a way to get professional help and ensure the child is protected. The author might be acting out of concern for the child, even if it causes family conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first, like talking to the parents or other authorities before involving CPS. But given the severity of the neglect and the child's safety at risk, it's arguable that waiting might not be safe. The brother is resistant to help, as he's in a state of anger and blaming others. The author's decision could prevent further harm to the child.\n\nSo, considering the child's safety is the top priority, the author's action is justified. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
