For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the brother had a kid at 17 and now both him and the baby's mom are neglecting the child. The author reports it to CPS, and now the brother is mad, thinking the dad did it. The question is whether the author is an asshole for reporting or staying silent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The brother is 17, and the neglect isn't super obvious but includes swearing in front of the kid, leaving her unattended, playpen for hours, injuries, and the parents of the brother are taking over. The author reports it, leading to CPS involvement. The brother is upset, blaming the dad.\n\nSo, the key points are: the child is being neglected, the brother is not fulfilling his duties, and the author took action. Legally, in many places, you can report suspected child abuse or neglect anonymously. The author did the right thing by reporting to protect the child. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't justify the neglect. However, the author didn't reveal themselves, which might have caused tension in the family.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author reported to protect the child and did it correctly (without lying), then they're not in the wrong. The brother's negligence is the issue here. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong). The alternative is A if the author acted wrongly. Since the child is at risk, reporting is justified. The silence part is about not telling the family, but that's personal and not necessarily wrong. So B.\n"
