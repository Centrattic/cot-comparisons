For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the brother became a parent at 17, which is young. He had a breakup with the baby's mother, and they're both acting out, using the child as a way to get back at each other. The examples given include leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and not properly watching her leading to injuries. The parents are now taking care of most of the child's needs, and the brother isn't contributing. The sister reports this to CPS, causing family conflict now.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the sister did the right thing. On one hand, CPS is supposed to protect children from neglect or abuse. If the brother and the mother are neglecting the child, then reporting could be necessary. The child's safety is the priority here. But on the other hand, family dynamics are tricky. The sister might be seen as betraying her brother, especially since he's under 18 and maybe not in the best situation. But is that a valid reason not to report neglect?\n\nThe key points are the neglectful behaviors: leaving the child unattended, injuries from not being watched, swearing in front of her. These are red flags for child welfare. CPS exists to intervene in such cases. The sister's duty might be to protect the child, even if it upsets the family. The brother's age and inexperience might contribute to his inability to care for the child properly, but that doesn't excuse neglect. \n\nThe sister did talk to her dad first, which shows she tried to address it within the family. When that didn't work, she took action. It's possible that she's not in the wrong because the child's well-being is more important than family loyalty in this case. The brother's anger is a consequence, but neglecting a child is a serious issue. So, the answer is probably B: No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
