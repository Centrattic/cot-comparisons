For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a tumultuous relationship with the mother, and neglect of the child. The author reports to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother is 17, which is a minor in most places, but he's a parent now. The mother is also unstable, and both are neglecting the child. The neglect includes swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, injuries, and using her as a pawn. The parents are stepping in. The author reports to CPS, and the brother is angry, thinking their dad did it.\n\nSo the question is, is the author the asshole? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the author is a sibling, but they're trying to protect the niece. The brother is the parent, and legally, parents have the right to care for their child, but there are limits when there's neglect. The author took action to protect the child, which might be justified. On the other hand, the brother might feel betrayed, and the author didn't try to resolve the issue within the family first. But given the severity of the neglect, the author's actions might be necessary to protect the child's welfare. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, any person can report suspected child abuse or neglect to CPS. The author isn't in a position of legal authority, but their responsibility as a family member isn't clear. However, if the child is in danger, the duty to report might override family loyalty. The brother's reaction might stem from feeling that the author overstepped, but the author's intent was to help. \n\nThe key factors here are the child's safety and well-being. If there's genuine neglect, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. The brother's anger is understandable, but the author's action was to prevent harm. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
