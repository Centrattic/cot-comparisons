For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services (CPS). The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a contentious breakup, and both the mother and brother neglecting the child by leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and using her as a pawn in their conflict. The parents are now taking over most of the parenting duties, and the author reported all the incidents they observed to CPS. The brother is upset, thinking the dad did it, and the family dynamics are strained.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, mandatory reporters (like teachers, doctors) are required to report, but even non-mandatory reporters can do so. The key here is whether the child is in danger. The author describes neglect: leaving the child unattended, playpen while gaming, injuries from not supervision, and exposure to swearing. These could be signs of neglect, which CPS is meant to address.\n\nThen, the brother's reaction. He's angry, and the family is upset. But does that make the author in the wrong? If the child is being harmed, the author's action might be justified. However, it's important to check if the author had the right to report. In the U.S., for example, you can report anonymously, so maybe the author did the right thing. But the brother might feel betrayed, which is a family issue. The author might have considered the child's safety over family loyalty, which is a tough call.\n\nAnother angle: was the author responsible for the child's well-being? Since the parents are now stepping in, maybe they could handle it. But if the parents are not able to or the situation is still harmful, CPS intervention might be necessary. The author might have wanted to protect the child, even if it caused family tension. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The author could be overstepping, maybe the brother just needs more support. But the description suggests ongoing neglect and conflict, so support might not be enough. Also, the author might be anonymous but still caused a rift by not telling the family. However, the main duty here is to the child's safety. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's primary responsibility is to protect the child. Reporting CPS is a legal obligation if there are reasonable suspicions. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they acted to prevent potential harm to the child, even though it caused family conflict. The brother's anger is a result of the situation, but the author's action was in the child's best interest.\n"
