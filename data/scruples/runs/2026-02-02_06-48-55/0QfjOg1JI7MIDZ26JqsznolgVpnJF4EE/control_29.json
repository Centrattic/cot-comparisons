For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's younger brother had a child when he was 17. Initially, he was taking responsibility, but after a bad breakup with the mother, things went downhill. Both the mother and the brother are using their daughter as a weapon against each other. The mother drops the baby off unexpectedly to bother my brother, leading to police involvement. Both parents are neglecting the child: swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, putting her in a playpen while they play games, and the child has gotten injured. The parents are now not helping with parenting, and the ex takes the child for Instagram pics. The author's parents have taken over, and the author reported this to CPS. Now the brother is upset because he thinks their dad did it, and there's family conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, mandatory reporters are required to report suspected child abuse or neglect. The author is likely a mandatory reporter if they're a family member, depending on jurisdiction. Even if not, anyone can report if they suspect harm. The child is being neglected\u2014left unattended, injured, exposure to swearing. Those are red flags for CPS.\n\nOn the emotional side, the brother is upset because he's losing custody, and the author didn't tell him it was them. But the brother's actions (neglect) are harming the child. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid reason. However, the method of not revealing themselves might cause additional family tension, but the priority is the child's safety.\n\nThe mother is also involved in the neglect, so the problem isn't just the brother. The author's parents are stepping in, but maybe not enough. Reporting CPS is a responsible action to ensure the child is safe. The brother might feel betrayed, but the author's responsibility to the child outweighs family loyalty in this case.\n\nSo the answer is B (no), the author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect the child from neglect and potential harm.\n"
