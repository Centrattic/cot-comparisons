For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother became a father at 17, had a breakup, and now both him and the mother are neglecting the child. The author reports this to CPS, which leads to the brother being upset and thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is child neglect. The brother and the mother are leaving the child unattended, yelling at her, not supervising her properly, leading to injuries. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The author felt it was necessary to report this to protect the child.\n\nMoral responsibility: If someone witnesses neglect or abuse, are they obligated to report it? In many places, it's legally mandated to report such cases to authorities. So from a legal standpoint, the author might be doing something required, not wrong.\n\nFamily dynamics: The brother is upset and the author didn't disclose they were the one who reported, which could be causing family tension. But was it their responsibility to do so? Maybe they felt it was necessary without involving the parents, but the parents are already taking care of the child. However, the brother's actions are harmful, so the author's intent was to protect the child.\n\nIs the author an asshole for staying quiet about reporting? If the author is hiding the truth to avoid conflict, maybe that's problematic. But the main issue is the child's safety. The author's actions were to protect the child, which is a noble intention. However, not disclosing their role might be seen as deceitful towards the family.\n\nSo, the key factors are the child's well-being versus family loyalty. If the neglect is real and the author acted to prevent further harm, then they're not in the wrong. However, if the situation was exaggerated or handled without proper evidence, maybe. But the description does include specific incidents like injuries and neglect. Also, the author didn't take it up with the brother first, which might be expected in some cases, but if the brother isn't responsive, reporting is necessary.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, mandatory reporters are required to report suspected abuse, even if it's a family member. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. Ethically, if they had a duty to protect the child, their action is justified. The problem is the family fallout, but that's a separate issue from being in the wrong regarding the report itself.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they prioritized the child's safety, which is a higher responsibility than family loyalty in this case. Even if it caused family issues, the intent was to protect the child from neglect.\n"
