For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services (CPS). The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a breakup with the mother, and both of them neglecting the child. The author reports to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main issue is child neglect. If the child is being harmed or neglected, then reporting could be a responsible action. The examples given\u2014swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, injuries from not supervision\u2014are signs of neglect. The parents are taking over, but maybe not enough. \n\nThe brother is a minor (17) when he had the child, so he's a teenager dealing with a child of his own. The baby's mother is also unstable and using the child against him. The author is concerned about the child's well-being and took action by reporting. \n\nBut wait, the brother is losing it, and the family is in turmoil. The author didn't inform them directly, which might be why the brother is upset. However, the author's duty is to protect the child, not to inform the family first. CPS is there to ensure the child's safety. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the neglect is real and ongoing, then reporting is the right thing. Even if the brother is a minor himself, the child's safety is the priority. The brother's reaction might be due to anger, but that doesn't mean the report was wrong. The other part is about staying quiet and not telling the family. But the question is whether the author is an asshole for reporting or for staying silent. The key is the child's welfare. The author had a valid reason to report, so they aren't the asshole. Answer B.\n"
