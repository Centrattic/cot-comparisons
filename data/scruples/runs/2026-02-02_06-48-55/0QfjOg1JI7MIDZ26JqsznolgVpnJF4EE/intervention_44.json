For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, then a breakup where both he and the mother are neglecting the kid. The author decided to report the neglect to CPS, which caused tension with their brother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporters have a duty to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Even if you're a family member, if you believe a child is in danger, you might be required to report it. So legally, the author might be doing the right thing.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The brother is their sibling, so there's a family relationship. However, the child's well-being is at stake. The author mentions neglect: swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries. These are serious issues. The parents are stepping in, but maybe not enough. \n\nThe author is being criticized by their brother for reporting, and the brother is upset. But is the author wrong for prioritizing the child's safety over family harmony? If the neglect is real, then the author might be justified. However, if the author exaggerated the situation or had ulterior motives, that could be a problem. But from the description, it seems like the author is genuinely concerned about the child's welfare.\n\nAlso, the author is staying quiet about being the reporter, which might be a separate issue. Some people feel that if you report, you should take responsibility for it. But in this case, since the brother is accusing others, maybe the author is protecting the family's privacy by staying anonymous. That part could be debatable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be legally and ethically justified due to the child's safety. The brother's reaction is understandable, but the author's priority is the child's well-being. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
