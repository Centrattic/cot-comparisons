For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a child at 17, and there are issues with neglect and conflict between him and the mother. The author reported it to CPS, and now there's family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The brother is a minor parent, and the child's well-being is the main concern. If there's neglect, like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries, then CPS has a role to step in. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a noble cause. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, reporting suspected child abuse or neglect is a responsibility, and it's protected under the law in many places. So from a legal standpoint, the author did the right thing. \n\nHowever, the family dynamics are complicated. The brother might feel betrayed, especially if he didn't ask for help. The author didn't step in directly but chose to involve CPS. Is there an expectation of privacy within the family? The author is a sibling, so there's a close relationship. Did the author consider other options before reporting? Maybe, but if the situation was severe enough, CPS involvement is appropriate. \n\nThe brother's reaction is causing family issues, but the author's action was to prevent harm. The key point is whether the child's safety was compromised. If the neglect is real, then reporting is justified. The author might not be in the wrong for reporting, even if it caused family conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), as their action was in the child's best interest.\n"
