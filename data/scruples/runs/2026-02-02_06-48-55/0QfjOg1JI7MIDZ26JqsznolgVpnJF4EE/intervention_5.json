For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS). The situation involves the brother having a child with an unstable girl, leading to neglect and conflict. The author reported the neglect after seeing things like swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, and injuries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting suspected child abuse or neglect is mandatory in many places. If there's a reasonable belief that a child is being harmed, it's not just a moral duty but a legal one to report it. The author might have felt they had no choice but to act to protect the child.\n\nThen, there's the family dynamic. The brother is 17, which is under the age of majority in many states, but even so, he's responsible for his child. The mother's behavior is described as erratic, dropping off the child maliciously, and the brother isn't helping. The parents are stepping in, but the situation is clearly not resolved without external intervention.\n\nThe author's decision to report could be seen as necessary to ensure the child's safety. However, the brother is upset, thinking the dad reported him, which might cause family tension. But legally, the author is protected from retaliation for making a good-faith report. The brother's anger is a natural reaction, but that doesn't make the author wrong if the report was justified.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author should have tried to resolve the issue within the family first. However, given the severity of the neglect\u2014leaving a toddler unattended, injuries\u2014intervention might be necessary. The author might have felt that staying silent would harm the child further. Also, the brother's behavior and the mother's actions indicate a pattern that isn't likely to change without CPS involvement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author acted in the child's best interest by reporting. They might not be in the wrong, but it's a tough call because family relationships are strained. However, the moral obligation to protect a child outweighs keeping family issues private in this case.\n"
