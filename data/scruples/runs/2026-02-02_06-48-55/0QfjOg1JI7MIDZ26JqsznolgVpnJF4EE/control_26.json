For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that their younger brother had a kid at 17 and now there's a lot of conflict between him and the baby's mother. They're both neglecting the child, leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and using her as a way to get back at each other. The author decided to report this to child protective services (CPS), which caused tension in the family because the brother is upset and thinks the dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, reporting suspected child neglect or abuse is a legal obligation, and people can do so anonymously. The author is trying to protect a child from what sounds like a harmful environment. The brother and the mother are both neglecting the child, which is a serious issue. Leaving a 16-month-old in a playpen while playing games for hours, not supervising leading to injuries, and exposing her to swearing are all red flags for neglect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's brother might feel betrayed because it's a family matter. But the well-being of the child should be the priority. The author's decision to report could be seen as responsible, especially since the parents are already stepping in, but maybe the brother isn't. The author might have felt it was necessary to involve CPS to ensure the child's safety.\n\nHowever, the author didn't mention if there were other steps taken before reporting, like trying to mediate or get help through other channels. But given the severity of the neglect described, it's understandable they went to CPS directly. The question is whether the author did the right thing despite the family fallout.\n\nSo, considering the child's safety and that reporting is a legal duty in such cases, the author is probably not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
