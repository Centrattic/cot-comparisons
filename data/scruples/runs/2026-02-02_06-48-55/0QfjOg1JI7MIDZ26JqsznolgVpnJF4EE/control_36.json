For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to child protective services is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a kid at 17, and after a breakup, both he and the mother are neglecting the child. Examples include swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, not supervising leading to injuries, and using the child as a weapon in their fights. The parents are now taking over, but the brother isn't helping. The person reported to CPS, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the actions of the person are justified. The key factors here are the well-being of the child and the legal obligations. The brother is a minor himself (17) and the child is 16 months old. The neglect described\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, exposure to swearing\u2014could be considered neglect under child protective services standards. Reporting to CPS is a legal recourse to ensure the child's safety.\n\nThe person's motivation seems to be concern for the child's welfare. They might have felt that no one else was stepping up to protect the child. Even though the brother is family, the responsibility to protect a child from neglect is a societal one. CPS exists for these situations where a parent is unable or unwilling to care for their child properly.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The brother is upset and thinks their dad did it. The person chose to stay quiet about being the reporter. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the aftermath. The act of reporting itself, when there's genuine neglect, is not wrong. The person might have handled the family fallout differently, but the primary action of reporting to protect the child is justified.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The person acted to protect the child from neglect, which is a valid and responsible action. The brother's reaction and the family tensions are a result of the situation, but the reporter isn't the asshole for doing what's necessary to ensure the child's safety.\n"
