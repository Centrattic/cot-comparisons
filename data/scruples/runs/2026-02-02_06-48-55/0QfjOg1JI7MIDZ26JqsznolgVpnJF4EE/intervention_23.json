For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author reported their brother to child protective services because they were concerned about the brother's daughter's well-being. The brother, who's 17, has a kid with an unstable girl, and they're both neglecting the child. The author's parents are now taking care of most of the responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, you're actually legally obligated to report it. So the act of reporting might be the right thing to do. The brother isn't a child himself, but he's a parent now. His actions (leaving the kid unattended, swearing in front of her, not helping with parenting) could be considered neglect. The author is trying to protect the child, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut wait, the brother is a minor? Wait, he's 17 when he had the kid, so now maybe he's a bit older? Let me check the original text again. The user says the brother had a kid at 17, but it doesn't specify his current age. If he's still a minor, there might be additional layers, but if he's an adult now, then it's about his parenting abilities. Either way, the author's intent is to protect the child, which is a good motive.\n\nNow, the brother is upset and thinks their dad did it. The author stayed quiet about being the one who reported. Is that a problem? Maybe the brother has a right to know who reported him, but the author might have a right to privacy. However, by staying quiet, the author might be causing family tension. But the main issue is whether the report was justified.\n\nThe key factors here are: the neglect described (leaving the child unattended, injuries, not helping with parenting duties). If these are true and documented, then the report is appropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to protect a child. Even if the brother is upset, the author's actions were aimed at preventing harm, which is a moral duty.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). They acted to protect a child from potential harm, which is a valid and responsible action.\n"
