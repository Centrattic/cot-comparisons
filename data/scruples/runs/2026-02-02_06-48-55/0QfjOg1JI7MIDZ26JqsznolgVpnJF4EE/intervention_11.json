For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the brother became a father at 17. Initially, he was doing okay, but after a bad breakup with the baby's mother, things went downhill. Both parents are using the child as leverage against each other. The mother drops off the kid unexpectedly to mess with the brother, and the brother, in turn, neglects the child by leaving her alone, swearing in front of her, and not paying enough attention. The child has even gotten injured due to this neglect. The parents (the author's parents) are now taking over most of the parenting duties, while the brother isn't contributing. The baby's mother uses the child for social media and to upset the brother. \n\nThe author, after discussing with their dad, reports the incidents to CPS. Now, the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it, and the family is in turmoil. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for reporting or staying silent about being the one who reported.\n\nSo, from a legal and ethical standpoint, reporting suspected child abuse or neglect is a responsibility. CPS exists to protect children, and if there's credible evidence of neglect (like leaving a toddler unattended, injuries, etc.), reporting is the right thing. The brother's actions here do seem to meet the criteria for neglect, even if it's not extreme. The mother's behavior is also problematic with dropping off the child unannounced and yelling at the brother's parents.\n\nThe author's parents are already stepping in, but maybe not enough. The brother isn't helping, and the child is being harmed. The author chose to report to CPS, which is within their rights. People can report anonymously, but in this case, the author stayed quiet, which might be causing family tension. However, the priority is the child's safety.\n\nSome might argue that the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first, but given the situation's severity and the risk to the child, CPS involvement is appropriate. The brother might feel betrayed, but the child's well-being is paramount. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. The answer should be B.\n"
