For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who had a child with an unstable girl, and now both parents are neglecting the child. The author reported this to CPS, leading to the brother's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, you can report suspected child abuse or neglect to CPS as a mandated reporter, which might include family members. So legally, the author might be within their rights.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The brother is a minor (17), and having a child at that age is challenging. The neglect described\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries\u2014could be signs of neglect. The parents taking over might be a temporary solution, but if the brother is neglecting his responsibilities, a report to CPS could be justified to protect the child.\n\nHowever, the brother is still a teenager, and the situation might be influenced by the unstable relationship with the mother. The author's decision to report without trying to resolve the issue within the family first could be seen as overstepping. But given the child's safety is at risk, the author's action might be necessary.\n\nThe brother's reaction is understandable, but the child's well-being is paramount. The author didn't disclose their role, which might have caused confusion, but that's a separate issue from the decision to report. Overall, if the neglect is real, the author isn't in the wrong. If there were no real signs of harm, maybe, but the story describes multiple incidents. So likely, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
