For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother becoming a parent at 17, then a breakup leading to neglect and conflict between him and the child's mother. The brother isn't helping, the mother uses the child as a weapon, and there's neglect like swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, and injuries. The parents are stepping in, but the brother is now angry, thinking their dad reported him.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the child's well-being and whether the neglect is significant enough for CPS intervention. The examples given\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, swearing\u2014could be considered neglectful. CPS exists to protect children from harm, so reporting such incidents is typically encouraged. The person's intent was to protect the child, which is a strong justification.\n\nHowever, some might argue about family privacy or the brother's right to parent. But the brother isn't fulfilling his responsibilities, and the child's safety is at risk. The brother's anger is understandable but doesn't negate the need for action. The person didn't stay silent when there was clear neglect. So, their actions were likely in the child's best interest, making them not the asshole."
