For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a kid at 17, and now both he and the baby's mother are neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping much, and the mother is using the kid to get back at him. They're both neglecting her, leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and she's getting injured. The parents are stepping in, and the person decided to report CPS. Now the brother is upset and thinks it was their dad.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from a moral and legal standpoint. Reporting child neglect to CPS is generally considered a responsible action because it's in the child's best interest. The brother is 17 when the child was born, so maybe he's a minor or just young. But regardless, if he's a parent, he's responsible for the child's care. The neglect described includes leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries, and the mother using the child as a weapon. These actions could be considered neglectful or even abusive.\n\nHowever, there's a family dynamic here. The brother is a young parent, and reporting to CPS might be seen as interfering. But the key point is the child's safety. CPS exists to protect children from harm, so reporting should be a valid action if there's evidence of neglect. The author didn't report out of malice but because the child was being harmed. The brother's reaction is part of the aftermath, but the author's intention was to help the child. \n\nIs there a gray area? Maybe if there were other solutions first, like family counseling or support. But given the situation has escalated to the point of CPS involvement, and the child is in danger, the report is justified. The author also didn't disclose themselves, which might add to the brother's anger but doesn't make the report wrong. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
