For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author reporting their 17-year-old brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) because of neglect and using the child as a pawn in their conflict. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The brother became a parent at 17, which is young, and after a breakup, he and the mother are using the child to get back at each other. Examples include dropping the kid off unexpectedly, swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, and injuries. The parents are now taking over, and the author reported the incidents to CPS. The brother is upset and blames the dad, leading to family issues. The author is considering if they're the asshole for reporting or for staying quiet.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Reporting to CPS is a legal action to protect a child's welfare. Neglect, like leaving a child in a playpen for hours without supervision, and exposing her to swearing and potential emotional harm, are serious concerns. CPS exists to intervene in such situations, so the author's action might be justified as a responsible step to ensure the child's safety. However, there's a possible lack of evidence; the author might be relying on hearsay or their own observations. Did they have concrete proof before reporting? If not, that could be problematic. Also, the brother's age and lack of parental experience might be factors. But the author's intention was to protect the child, which is a noble cause. The brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't make the neglect okay. The author didn't stay silent; they took action when neglect was evident. So, while the situation is complex, the author's priority was the child's well-being. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
