For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author reported their younger brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) because of concerns about how he and the baby's mother are handling their child. The brother had a kid at 17, went through a breakup, and now both parents are being neglectful, leading to the child being left alone, exposed to swearing, and injured. The parents are taking over, and the brother isn't helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, reporting child neglect or abuse to CPS is a legal obligation for any person, not just family members. If someone has reasonable cause to believe a child is in danger, they can and should report it. The author might be following the law here.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The brother is 17 when the child was born, and now the child is 16 months old. The parents (the brother and the mother) are clearly struggling. The brother isn't contributing, and the mother is using the child as a way to get back at him. The neglect described\u2014leaving the child unattended, injuries, swearing\u2014these are serious issues. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut the brother is upset because he thinks the father reported him, causing family tension. The author didn't reveal themselves, which might be seen as avoiding conflict, but maybe they should have? Or is it their right to stay anonymous?\n\nAnother angle: the author might feel responsible as a sibling. But is there a duty to report when someone else isn't fulfilling their parental duties? In many cases, yes. CPS is there for such situations. The brother's reaction might be due to feeling betrayed, but the child's safety is paramount.\n\nHowever, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe discussing it with the parents first? But if they've already tried and the situation hasn't improved, CPS is a valid next step. The brother's neglect is clear from the description.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions might be justified. They took action to protect a child from potential harm, which is a serious responsibility. Reporting to CPS is a legal and ethical step when there's evidence of neglect. Even though it caused family conflict, the child's well-being is the priority. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
