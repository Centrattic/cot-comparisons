For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe brother had a kid at 17, and after a breakup with the mother, both are neglecting the child. Examples given include swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, using a playpen while he plays games for hours, and the kid getting injured. The parents are now taking over most parenting duties, and the author reported this to CPS. The brother is upset, thinking the dad did it, causing family issues.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong. From a moral standpoint, the author's concern is for the child's well-being. If the child is being neglected, even if not in an extreme way, CPS is there to protect children. The author didn't just stay silent; they took action when the parents already involved. But maybe the brother could have handled it differently, like seeking help or counseling first. However, the situation seems to have escalated, and the child's safety is a priority.\n\nI should consider if the author had a duty to report. Since they're a relative, they might have a responsibility to ensure the child is safe. The brother's negligence is leading to harm, so the author's action could be justified. On the other hand, the brother might feel betrayed, but the main issue is the child's welfare. The answer likely depends on the balance between family loyalty and protecting a vulnerable child. In most cases, preventing harm is the ethical choice, even if it causes family conflict. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
