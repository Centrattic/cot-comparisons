For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe user's younger brother became a father at 17. Initially, he was doing okay, but after a bad breakup with the mother, both he and the mother are using the child as a weapon against each other. The mother drops off the kid suddenly, and there's a lot of conflict. The brother isn't helping much now, and the parents are stepping in. The neglect isn't extreme but includes swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, not watching her leading to injuries, and the mother using the child for Instagram. The user reported all this to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they're an asshole for reporting. First, I need to consider the duty of care for a child. Even if the parents are the ones taking care of the kid now, if they're not the legal guardians, maybe the brother still has responsibilities. The brother isn't helping, and the mother is using the child. The CPS report was based on actual neglect incidents. The user's intention was to protect the child from harm. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a family issue here. The user is causing tension by reporting, even if it's for a good reason. But the key point is the safety of the child. If the brother is neglecting his responsibilities, then reporting might be justified. CPS is there to protect children, even if the parents aren't perfect. The user might be doing the right thing to prevent further harm. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect the child's welfare, which is a priority. Even if it caused family conflict, the child's safety comes first.\n"
