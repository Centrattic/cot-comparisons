For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The key points from the situation are:\n\n1. The brother had a child at 17 and there's a contentious relationship with the ex-partner, leading to the child being used as a pawn.\n2. Both parents are neglecting the child in various ways, including leaving her unattended, swearing in her presence, and the ex-partner dropping off the child as retaliation.\n3. The parents' own parents are now handling most of the parenting duties, while the brother isn't contributing.\n4. The author reported the neglect to CPS, which has caused family conflict, particularly with the brother being upset and not knowing who reported them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The primary duty of any child is to protect the well-being of another minor. If there's evidence of neglect or abuse, reporting to CPS is generally considered the right action. The examples given\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries from lack of supervision\u2014could qualify as neglect. The author likely acted out of concern for the child's safety.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family dynamics and the brother's reaction. The brother is upset, and the author chose not to reveal themselves, which might have contributed to the family tension. But the main question is about being in the wrong. Legally, reporting suspected abuse or neglect is protected under whistleblower laws in many places, so the author shouldn't be in the wrong for doing so.\n\nMoral considerations: The child's welfare is paramount. Neglect is a serious issue, and intervening to ensure the child's safety is ethically sound. The author might have considered other options, like counseling or family mediation, but if those failed, CPS is the appropriate authority. The brother's responsibility as a parent is compromised, and the author stepped in to fulfill that duty when the parents couldn't.\n\nPotential issues: The brother might feel betrayed, and the author's anonymity could cause ongoing family conflict. However, the author's decision to report was based on the child's best interest, not personal gain. The neglect examples are specific and concerning, which strengthens the case for the report being justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were aimed at protecting a vulnerable child from neglect, which is a valid reason to report to CPS. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
