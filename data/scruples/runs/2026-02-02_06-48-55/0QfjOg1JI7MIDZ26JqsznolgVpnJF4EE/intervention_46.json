For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother became a father at 17, and there's been a contentious relationship with the mother of his child. They're using the child as a way to get at each other, neglecting her, and there are incidents like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries. The parents have taken over most of the childcare, and the brother isn't helping. The author reported this to CPS, which led to CPS involvement and the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it. The author is now being blamed by their brother and is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the child is being neglected, there's abuse happening, and the author took action to report it. The question is whether the author did the right thing or if they're in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, most places have laws that allow any person to report suspected child abuse or neglect without fear of retaliation. The author's actions could be seen as protecting the child from a harmful environment. However, family dynamics can complicate things. The brother might feel betrayed, but the author's intent was to ensure the child's safety.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the laws and the circumstances. Since the author observed neglect and injury, reporting to CPS is a responsible action. CPS is there to protect children, so the author isn't in the wrong. The brother's anger is unfortunate, but the primary concern is the child's well-being. The author might have a duty to act, especially if they're in a position to know the details. \n\nOn the other hand, sometimes family members might prefer to handle things internally. However, in cases of clear neglect and harm, outside intervention is necessary. The author might not be in the wrong for reporting, but maybe there's a nuance if there was a way to mediate without CPS. However, given the severity described, it's probably justified.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They took action to protect a vulnerable child when neglect and harm were occurring. While the family conflict is messy, the child's safety is paramount.\n"
