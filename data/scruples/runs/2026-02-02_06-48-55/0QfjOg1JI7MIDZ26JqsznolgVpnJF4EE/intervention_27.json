For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who had a child, and both he and the mother are neglecting the child. The author reported them, leading to CPS involvement and family conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting suspected child neglect is a legal obligation for many people, but even for those without a mandate, it's often considered a moral duty to protect children. The brother is 17, so he's a minor as well, which might complicate things. The neglect includes leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries. These are serious issues that could harm the child's well-being.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid concern. CPS exists to intervene in such cases, so reporting them isn't inherently wrong. However, the brother is also a minor, and the mother is unstable. The author might be overstepping by taking such a drastic step without trying other options first, like counseling or family support. But given the severity of the neglect, maybe there's no better option.\n\nThe family is now blaming the father, but the author knows they did it. The author is also staying quiet about their role, which could be seen as dishonesty. However, keeping the identity confidential is part of CPS procedures, so maybe that's not their fault.\n\nSo, the key points are the child's safety versus the brother's rights and the family dynamics. The author's actions were aimed at preventing harm, which is justifiable. But the brother is a minor, and the approach might not have considered his maturity or potential for change. However, the neglect is significant enough that intervention might be necessary. The author isn't in the wrong because their intent was to protect the child, even if the method caused family conflict. The answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
