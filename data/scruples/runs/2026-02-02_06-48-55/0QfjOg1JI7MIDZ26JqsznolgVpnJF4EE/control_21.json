For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nThe brother became a parent at 17, had a breakup with the mother, and now both are neglecting the child. They argue, use the kid as leverage, leave her unattended, swear in front of her, and there have been injuries. The parents are now taking over, and the brother isn't helping. The person reported to CPS, causing tension because the brother is upset and thinks their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Child neglect is a serious issue. CPS exists to protect children from harm. If there's evidence of neglect, reporting is the responsible action. The author's concerns are valid: neglect, leaving the child alone, injuries. Reporting to CPS is their right and duty to protect the child.\n\nBut maybe there's a family angle. The brother is a minor (17?), but the child in question is his daughter. The mother's behavior is also problematic. The author might be seen as interfering, but if the child is in danger, it's not just family business anymore. The brother isn't meeting his responsibilities, and the parents are stepping in. The author had to do what's best for the child, even if it caused family conflict.\n\nSo, the possible arguments against the author: maybe they should have tried to help the brother first, or maybe the situation wasn't bad enough. But the injuries and consistent neglect are red flags. CPS is there for a reason. The author isn't the asshole; they're protecting a child. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
