For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. So, first, I need to understand the situation. The brother became a parent at 17, had some issues with the baby's mother, and now they're both neglecting the child. The sister-in-law (the person who wrote the post) reports them to Child Protective Services, and the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nNow, the key points here are the neglect: swearing in front of the child, leaving her unattended, injuries from not supervision, and the parents taking over. The brother isn't helping, and the mother uses the kid for attention. The reporter's intention was to protect the child, even though it caused family conflict.\n\nI need to assess whether the action of reporting to CPS is wrong. Legally, any person can report suspected child neglect or abuse, and it's actually encouraged to protect the child's welfare. The person who reported did so because they observed these issues, so they're fulfilling a societal responsibility. \n\nHowever, there might be emotional family dynamics here. The brother is upset, and the reporter is staying quiet about their role. But the main question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the neglect is real and the child's safety is at risk, the reporter's action is justified. The brother's anger is understandable but doesn't make the reporter wrong. \n\nPossible counterarguments: maybe the reporter didn't give the brother a chance to improve, or maybe they're overstepping family boundaries. But given the severity of the neglect (injuries, lack of supervision), it's a safety issue. CPS is there for such cases. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
