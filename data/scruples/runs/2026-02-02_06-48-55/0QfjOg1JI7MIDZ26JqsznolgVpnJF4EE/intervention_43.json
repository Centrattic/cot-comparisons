For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for reporting their brother to CPS. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a parent and is now neglecting his child due to a bitter custody battle with the mother. The author reports the neglect, leading to CPS involvement and family tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting child neglect is usually a legal obligation in many places. If there are credible signs of neglect or endangerment, anyone can report it, especially if the child's safety is at risk. The author mentions specific incidents like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries. These could qualify as neglect.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The brother is 17, which is a minor in most places, but he's a parent. His maturity and ability to care for a child are questionable. The author's parents are stepping in, which might be a temporary fix but doesn't address the long-term neglect. The author's motivation is concern for the child's well-being, which is a valid reason to report.\n\nHowever, the brother is losing it, thinking Dad did it. The author didn't come forward, which might add to the family stress. But staying silent might also allow the neglect to continue. The question is whether the author had a duty to report or if they overstepped.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, mandatory reporters (like teachers, social workers) must report, but others can choose. The author is a family member, so while not a mandatory reporter, their action is legally permissible. Ethically, it's about whether they acted in the child's best interest despite family ties.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but considering the child's safety, the answer leans towards the author being in the right. So the correct answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
