For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The younger brother had a child at 17 with a girl who's described as \"relatively unstable.\" Initially, he was doing okay, but after a breakup, both he and the mother are using the child as leverage. There are examples like the mother dropping off the kid during his dates to get back at him, and the brother neglecting the child by leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and not watching enough leading to injuries. The parents are now taking over most of the parenting, and the brother isn't helping. The author reported all this to CPS, and now the brother is upset, blaming the dad. The question is whether the author is the asshole for reporting or staying quiet.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate based on the details. Reporting to CPS is typically a legal responsibility if there's neglect or abuse. The examples given\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries\u2014could be signs of neglect. The mother's behavior, like dropping the kid off without notice, might also be concerning. \n\nHowever, family dynamics can be complex. The brother is still a minor (17) and might be struggling with responsibilities. The author's role is to protect the child. CPS is meant to determine if the child is in a safe environment. Even if the brother is a family member, the child's well-being is paramount. \n\nThe user might be thinking that the author shouldn't interfere or that the brother's youth and the parents' involvement make it a family matter. But the key here is the child's safety. If there's any indication of harm, reporting is the right step. The brother's reaction is understandable, but the author had a duty to protect the child. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they took action to ensure the child's safety, even if it caused family conflict. The user might be considering whether it's the family's problem, but neglect is a serious issue that CPS is there to address.\n"
