For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation.\n\nThe brother had a kid at 17 with an unstable girl. They're not handling parenting well. The mom is dropping the kid off unexpectedly and being abusive, both parents are neglecting the child. The parents are taking over, but the brother isn't helping. The author reported it to CPS, leading to intervention. The brother is upset and thinks dad did it.\n\nFirst, the key question is whether the author did the right thing by reporting. CPS exists to protect children from neglect and abuse. The situation described includes leaving the kid unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries. These are signs of neglect. The brother and mother are using the child as a weapon in their conflict, which is harmful.\n\nThe author's intent was to protect their niece/nephew. Reporting to CPS is a legal action and within the system's purpose. The brother's anger is understandable but not a justification for ignoring the child's welfare. The author didn't have to stay silent; they had a duty to act if they believed the child was at risk.\n\nEven though family dynamics are messy, the primary concern is the child's safety. The author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to ensure the child isn't neglected. Also, staying quiet might have allowed the situation to worsen. CPS involvement is appropriate here.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They acted in the best interest of the child, which is the purpose of CPS reporting.\n"
