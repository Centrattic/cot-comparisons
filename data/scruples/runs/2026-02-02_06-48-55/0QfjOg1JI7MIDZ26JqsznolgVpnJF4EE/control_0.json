For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a parent and is now neglecting his child, with both him and the mother using the child as a weapon in their bitter split. The sister decided to report this to CPS, and now her brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. CPS is meant to intervene in cases of child neglect or abuse. The brother is a minor parent (17) and the child is 16 months old. Leaving the child in a playpen while gaming for hours, not supervising leading to injuries, and leaving the child with strangers or in unsafe situations could all be considered neglectful. The mother is also being irresponsible by dropping off the child unannounced, yelling, and not taking proper care. The parents have taken over most of the duties, which suggests the brother isn't fulfilling his responsibilities.\n\nThe sister's actions are aimed at protecting the child from neglect. Even though it's a family matter, the well-being of the child is paramount. While it's a difficult decision, the sister's intent was to ensure the child's safety. The brother's reaction is understandable but perhaps misguided. However, the sister staying silent about her role in the report might cause family tension, but that's a different issue. The key point is whether the report was justified. Since there's evidence of neglect, the sister isn't in the wrong for reporting. She's acting in the child's best interest, even if it causes family conflict.\n"
