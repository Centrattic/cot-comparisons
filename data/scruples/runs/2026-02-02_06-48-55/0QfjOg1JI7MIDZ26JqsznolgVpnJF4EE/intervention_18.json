For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a younger brother who became a father at 17 and now is neglecting his child due to a bitter relationship with the mother. The siblings are using the child as leverage against each other, and there are instances of neglect like leaving the kid unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries. The author decided to report this to CPS, and now the brother is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting suspected child neglect is typically protected by law in many places. The author might have a duty to report if they believe the child is in danger. However, the brother and the mother are both adults, so maybe there's a question about whether it's their personal matter or a legal one where the child is involved.\n\nThe child's well-being is the main concern here. If the child is being neglected or harmed, then reporting might be necessary. The author's intention was to protect the child, which is a valid reason. But the brother is an adult, so maybe the parents have a right to handle it without CPS. However, since the child is involved, the law often sides with child protection in such cases.\n\nThe brother is an adult, but the child is a minor. Child Protective Services (CPS) exists to protect children from harm, regardless of the parents' age. So even if the parents are adults, if they're neglecting their child, CPS can get involved. The author's action could be justified as trying to protect the child from harm. On the other hand, if the author had a personal motive or exaggerated the situation, that could be a problem. But from the description, it seems like the author is concerned about the child's safety.\n\nAnother angle is family dynamics. The author might be overstepping by reporting to CPS, which could cause family conflict. But the child's safety comes first. If the parents are neglecting the child, then CPS intervention is appropriate. The brother's reaction is understandable, but his actions might be contributing to the problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If protecting the child is the priority, then the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the author should have tried to resolve it within the family first, maybe it's A. But in cases of child neglect, immediate reporting is often encouraged. So leaning towards B.\n"
