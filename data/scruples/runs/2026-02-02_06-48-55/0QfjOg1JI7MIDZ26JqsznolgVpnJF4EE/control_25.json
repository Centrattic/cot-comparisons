For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether reporting their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) was the right move. \n\nSo, first, the brother is 17 and has a daughter with a girl he's broken up with. The situation sounds pretty bad. They're both being neglectful, using the child as a weapon in their arguments. The mother is dropping the kid off to get back at him, and the brother is leaving the child unattended, letting her get injured, and not helping with parenting. The parents are now taking care of the kid, but the brother is doing nothing. The author reported this to CPS, which caused tension in the family.\n\nNow, the main question is: is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect. In many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, you are legally required to report it. So if the author is a mandated reporter (like a teacher, doctor, etc.), they must report. If not, they still can report if they have concerns. The situation here includes leaving a 16-month-old in a playpen while playing video games, swearing in front of her, injuries\u2014those are signs of neglect. So legally, the author might be in the right by reporting.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The brother is a family member, and the author might feel guilty for reporting a sibling. However, the child's well-being is the priority. If neglect continues, the child could be harmed further. The author might have a responsibility to protect the niece/nephew, even if it causes family conflict.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The brother is upset, thinking the father did it. The author chose not to reveal themselves, which might be to avoid conflict. But is keeping it secret part of the issue? If the brother is being blamed wrongly, maybe the author should come forward? Or maybe the author is in the right because they wanted to protect the child without adding to the family drama.\n\nThe key points are the child's safety versus family loyalty. The author saw neglect and took action to prevent harm. CPS's involvement is necessary if the child is at risk. The brother's reaction is understandable, but the author's action was to protect the child. So, from a moral and legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether they overstepped, but given the circumstances, reporting seems justified.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
