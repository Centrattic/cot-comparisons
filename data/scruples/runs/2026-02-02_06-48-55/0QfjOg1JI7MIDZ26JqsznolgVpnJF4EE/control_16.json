For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complicated. The brother had a kid at 17, and things went south after a breakup. Both he and the baby's mom are neglecting the child, leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and even causing her injuries. The parents are now taking over, and the brother isn't helping. The person in question reported this to CPS, which caused tension in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Child protective services (CPS) exists to protect children from abuse and neglect. If there's evidence of neglect, like leaving a child unattended or exposing them to harmful situations, reporting is actually a legal duty in many places. So legally, the person might be justified.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The child's safety is the top priority. The brother isn't providing proper care, and the mother is using the child as a weapon in their conflict. The reporter, who is an older sibling, might feel responsible since the parents are stepping in but the brother is neglecting his duties. Reporting to CPS is an attempt to ensure the child is safe, even if it causes family conflict.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the reporter should have tried to resolve it within the family first, maybe mediate or support the brother instead of involving CPS. But if the neglect is ongoing and harmful, waiting might not be in the child's best interest. Also, the brother's reaction is understandable but doesn't excuse the neglect. The reporter's anonymity might also be important here; if CPS is involved, they have to follow procedures, which the brother is upset about.\n\nSo putting it all together, the person isn't in the wrong because they acted to protect a child from neglect. The answer should be B, Not in the wrong.\n"
