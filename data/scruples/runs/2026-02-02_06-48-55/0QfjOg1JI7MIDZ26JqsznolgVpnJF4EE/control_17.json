For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother having a child at 17, a breakup, and both parents neglecting the child. The brother isn't helping much, and the ex uses the kid as a weapon. The parents are now taking care of the child, and the author reported to CPS. They're being accused of causing problems.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Reporting child neglect is a serious matter. In many places, mandatory reporting laws require people to report suspected child abuse or neglect. Even if not mandatory, it's a moral duty. The child is being left unattended, there's swearing in her presence, injuries from not being watched, and the parents are using her as a tool in their conflict. That sounds like neglect.\n\nThe brother's behavior isn't great\u2014leaving her in a playpen to game, not helping, and the ex dropping the child off to spite him. The parents stepping in makes sense because they're the grandparents. The author's decision to report might be seen as protecting the child, which is a priority. But the brother is upset because he thinks the dad did it, which is causing family issues. The author didn't tell anyone they were the one who reported, which could be seen as trying to avoid conflict, but maybe they should have been honest.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The main point is whether the report was justified. If the child is in danger, then reporting is correct. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the priority is the child's safety. Even though family dynamics are messy, the author acted to protect the child. The brother's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's concern for the child's well-being is valid. The neglectful actions listed are serious enough to warrant CPS involvement. So, the answer is B.\n"
