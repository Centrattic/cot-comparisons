For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for reporting their brother to child protective services. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the brother became a father at 17 and had some issues with the baby's mother. They are both acting out, using the child as a weapon in their disputes. There are instances of neglect\u2014swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, playpen while gaming, injuries. The parents are now taking over, and the brother isn't helping. The sibling reports to CPS, and the brother is upset, thinking it's the dad. The user is unsure if they're the asshole.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, you are legally required to report suspected child abuse or neglect. So from a legal standpoint, the author might be doing the right thing. But family dynamics are messy. The brother might see this as betrayal, but the author's intention was to protect the child.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried intervening in another way first, like supporting the brother to improve his parenting, or involving other family members or social services before CPS. But given the severity of the neglect and the risk to the child's safety, sometimes direct action is necessary. The question is whether the author had a duty to report and if their intervention was justified despite the family fallout.\n\nThe author's reasoning for staying quiet about being the reporter could also be a point. If they don't take responsibility, that might add to the problem. However, their primary concern was the child's well-being. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, protecting a child from harm is a strong ethical position. The brother's reaction is about personal feelings, but the child's safety is paramount. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
