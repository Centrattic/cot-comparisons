For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a younger brother who became a father at 17 and is now struggling with the baby's mother, leading to neglect of the child. The author reports them to CPS, and now the brother is upset, thinking their dad did it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, mandatory reporting laws require people to report suspected child abuse or neglect. If the author witnessed neglect, like leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and injuries, they might have a legal duty to report. So legally, the author might be in the right.\n\nEthically, the child's well-being is a priority. The brother and mother are not providing adequate care, using the child as a weapon in their conflict. The parents are stepping in, but maybe the child still needs official intervention. The author's action could prevent further harm. \n\nHowever, the author didn't inform their brother beforehand. Maybe they should have tried to help him first, like finding counseling or support. Reporting without trying to resolve it internally might be seen as harsh. But if the brother wasn't receptive to help and the situation was dangerous, the author might have done the right thing.\n\nThe brother is upset and it's causing family issues. The author is silent about their role, which could be seen as avoiding conflict, but it's also protecting the child. The question is whether the duty to protect the child outweighs the family conflict caused.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong. Their actions were to protect the child, which is a higher priority. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
