For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who became a father and is now neglecting the child with the mother. The parents have taken over, but the brother isn't helping. The person reported them to CPS, and now the brother is upset.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects here. The main issue is child neglect. If a minor is being harmed or neglected, it's a legal duty in many places to report it. The author is an adult, so they might have a responsibility to protect the child. The brother is 17, so still a minor in most countries, but he's a parent now. However, minors can't legally be parents in some places, but that's a different angle. The key is the neglect\u2014leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, injuries. These are signs of neglect.\n\nThe author reported to CPS, which is a protective agency. Legally, if someone knows of child abuse or neglect, they are mandated by law to report it. So the author is following the law. Ethically, protecting the child's well-being is a priority. Even if the brother is a family member, the child's safety comes first.\n\nNow, the brother is upset and blaming their dad, but the author kept their identity as the reporter. That might be causing family tension, but the author isn't in the wrong for staying silent about it. They might be avoiding conflict, which is understandable given the family dynamics.\n\nBut wait, is there a cultural or situational nuance here? In some cultures, family matters are handled internally. However, child welfare laws are clear in most places. The neglect is documented with specific examples. So the author's actions, while causing family issues, are legally and ethically correct. The brother's anger doesn't negate the author's responsibility. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
