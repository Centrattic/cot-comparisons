For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother's ex using their child as a weapon in their bitter breakup. There are instances of neglect, like the kid being left alone, swearing in front of her, injuries from not being watched properly. The parents are stepping in, but the brother isn't helping. The person reported to CPS, which caused tension in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting suspected child neglect is a legal duty in many places. If there's credible evidence of harm or neglect, it's not just a moral obligation but a legal one. The brother's situation seems to meet the criteria for CPS involvement. The author's actions were to protect the child, which is a primary concern for any child welfare system.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The brother is upset, thinking their dad reported him, which is causing conflict. The author stayed quiet about being the reporter. But did they have a responsibility to come forward? In situations where a child is at risk, confidentiality of the reporter is often protected, so the author might not be obligated to reveal themselves, especially to avoid family conflict. However, staying silent could lead to ongoing tension if the brother continues to blame others.\n\nIs the author wrong for reporting? Legally, no. Ethically, they're trying to protect a vulnerable child. The brother's actions and the ex's behavior are problematic. The author's intent was to help the child, which is a valid reason. The family's upset is a consequence but not a justification for inaction if the child is in danger.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have tried other avenues first, like counseling or family mediation. But if those weren't effective or available, CPS is the right step. The neglect described, such as leaving the child unattended leading to injuries, is serious. The author acted when others (the parents) were already involved but perhaps not enough.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They took necessary action to protect a child from potential harm, which aligns with both legal requirements and ethical responsibility.\n"
