For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to Child Protective Services (CPS) is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother, a teenager, becoming a parent and then struggling with the responsibilities. The mother of the child is also not helping, and both are neglecting the child in various ways. The author's parents are stepping in, but the brother is angry at the author for reporting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Reporting child neglect or abuse is a civic duty in many places. If there's evidence of neglect, like leaving the child unattended, exposure to swearing, and injuries, then reporting is actually the responsible thing to do. CPS exists to protect children, so the author might be justified in their actions.\n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't have enough evidence or misinterpreted the situations. But according to the description, there are multiple instances of neglect: leaving the child in a playpen for hours, not watching her leading to injuries, and both parents being unfit. The author had a conversation with their dad, which might indicate they were concerned and discussed it before acting. \n\nThe brother is upset because he feels his rights are being violated, but the well-being of the child is paramount. The author hasn't done anything wrong legally, as reporting is confidential and justified when there's suspicion of harm. Also, staying silent while a child is neglected could be considered complicity. The author's decision to report and then stay quiet to avoid conflict might be seen as a protective measure, but the initial report was necessary.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). They acted in the child's best interest, which is the priority in such cases.\n"
