For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author reported their brother to child protective services because they felt the brother and his ex-girlfriend were neglecting their daughter. The brother is 17, which is pretty young, and the situation sounds really chaotic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you suspect child neglect or abuse, you have a duty to report it. So even if the person isn't a legal guardian, they might still be required by law to report such cases. The author might have a legal obligation here, which would mean they're not in the wrong.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The brother is clearly not handling his responsibilities, and the child is being exposed to harmful situations\u2014like being left alone, swearing, and injuries. If the author believes the child's safety is at risk, stepping in could be seen as the right thing to do, especially when other family members (like the parents) are already taking over. The alternative is inaction, which could harm the child more. So ethically, the author might be justified in reporting.\n\nBut then there's the family dynamic. The brother is upset and thinks the father did it. The author didn't reveal themselves, which could be causing tension. However, the author's silence might be to avoid conflict, which is a common reason. But does that make them an asshole? Maybe not, because they're trying to protect the family from further conflict once CPS is involved.\n\nAnother angle: the brother's age. At 17, he might not have the maturity to handle parenthood, and the ex's behavior is exacerbating the problem. The author might be trying to step in because they see no other solutions. If the parents are already involved, maybe the author felt it wasn't enough and needed official intervention.\n\nPotential downsides: Reporting could have long-term consequences for the brother, like losing custody rights. The author might be overstepping by not trying other methods first, like counseling or involving other support systems. However, given the neglect described, it might be necessary.\n\nSo, considering the legal duty and the child's welfare, the author is probably not in the wrong. They acted to protect the child, even if it caused family issues. The neglect is significant enough that reporting is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
