For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old brother who had a child with an unstable girl. They split up, and both parents are neglecting the child by leaving her unattended, swearing in front of her, and using her as a weapon in their fights. The brother isn't helping, and the mother takes the kid for Instagram. The author reports to CPS, leading to the brother being upset and the family problems.\n\nFirst, consider the legal duty. In many places, people are mandated reporters if they suspect child abuse or neglect. Even if the author isn't a mandated reporter, they have a moral obligation if the child's safety is at risk. The neglect described includes leaving the child unattended, injuries, and exposure to swearing. These are signs of neglect, which CPS is meant to address.\n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics are messy here. The brother is young and might feel that the report was an invasion of privacy. However, the author's intent was to protect the child. The brother's reaction could be due to feeling betrayed, but the child's welfare is paramount. The author might be right to intervene, especially if the parents aren't stepping up. The siblings' actions (mother using the child for social media) also contribute to the neglect.\n\nThe question is whether the report was justified. The key factors are the child's safety and the presence of neglect. The author took action to prevent harm, which is a positive step. The brother's anger is understandable but doesn't negate the need to protect the child. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
