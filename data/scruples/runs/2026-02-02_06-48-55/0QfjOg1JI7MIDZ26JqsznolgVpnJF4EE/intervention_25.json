For a while, it was going fairly well and he was stepping up to the plate, until he had a particularly nasty breakup with the baby momma.\n\nAs a result, the two of them constantly try to pawn off their daughter to each other, and use her as ammunition. For example, the mother likes to stalk my brother on his days off and just drop the kid off to \u201cget back at him\u201d when he has dates planned. It\u2019s gotten so bad that she has had the cops remove her from my parents property because she was standing in the front yard yelling angrily for my brother.\n\nAs a result, both of them are super bitter and have started neglecting their daughter. It\u2019s nothing super over the top, but there\u2019s lots of swearing in front of her, leaving her unattended, leaving her in a playpen while he plays video games for several hours, not watching her enough that she\u2019s injured herself several times (she\u2019s currently around 16 months).  Currently my parents have taken over most of the parenting duties, while my brother really does nothing in the house to help, and the baby momma takes the kid seemingly to take Instagram pictures and to mess with by brother.\n\nSo, one day after talking to my dad about it, I decided to just report all the incidences I\u2019ve seen to CPS. They\u2019ve recently stepped in, and my brother is losing it on everyone in the family. He thinks my dad did it, and it\u2019s causing problems.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reporting? And/or am I one for staying quiet and not telling anyone I was the one who did it?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who reported their brother to CPS is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother had a child at 17, and both him and the mother are neglecting the child. The author reported it, and now the brother is upset, thinking the dad did it. The question is whether the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and legal aspects. Reporting child neglect is a legal duty in many places. If there's evidence of neglect, reporting to CPS is actually the right thing to do to protect the child. The brother and the mother are allegedly leaving the child unattended, swearing in front of her, and not providing proper care. The parents are stepping in, but the author felt it wasn't enough.\n\nHowever, there's the family dynamic aspect. The brother is 17 and already a parent, which is tough. The author's intentions might be good, but the fallout is causing family conflict. The brother is upset, and the author is hiding their identity. But the main issue is the child's well-being. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author overstepped, but if there's neglect, the law typically requires reporting. So legally and ethically, the author might not be in the wrong. The brother's reaction is understandable, but the child's safety comes first. The author's decision to report could be seen as necessary to intervene when the parents aren't providing adequate care. \n\nBut maybe there's more nuance. Did the author try other avenues first? The post says they talked to their dad, but maybe they should have offered help instead of immediately reporting? However, if the situation is as bad as described, and the parents aren't helping, reporting might be the only option. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because protecting a child from neglect is a priority, even if it causes family tension. The author acted in the child's best interest.\n"
