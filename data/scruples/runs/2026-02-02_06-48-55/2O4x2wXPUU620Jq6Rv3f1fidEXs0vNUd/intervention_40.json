The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making up a story to stop cashiers from commenting on their purchases. The scenario involves the author being annoyed by cashiers' curiosity about their shopping choices. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author felt uncomfortable when a cashier criticized their purchase of a pineapple, making it awkward. Then, when another cashier asked about buying multiple peppers, the author lied about it being for a swingers' potluck, which stopped the cashier from talking.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the impact of their actions. The author wanted to shut the cashier up and make the situation awkward so they wouldn't comment further. The lie was meant to teach the cashier a lesson about commenting on purchases. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, lying is generally considered wrong because it's deceptive. However, the cashier's behavior might have been intrusive or inappropriate. Cashiers often engage in small talk, but commenting on a customer's spending habits or implying judgment (like calling someone stupid) can cross a line. \n\nThe author's response, while effective, involves fabricating a personal and potentially offensive detail. Even if the cashier was being overbearing, the author's method of confronting it was through deception, which could be seen as manipulative. \n\nIf the cashier was being inconsiderate, the appropriate response might be to politely ask them not to comment further, rather than lying. The author's action might escalate misunderstandings or cause the cashier unnecessary embarrassment if the lie is discovered. \n\nConsidering these factors, even though the cashier's behavior was problematic, the author's decision to lie perpetuates the issue of dishonesty. The author's approach is a form of passive-aggressive retaliation that doesn't address the root problem but instead uses a white lie to avoid the situation. \n\nTherefore, while the cashier's behavior was inappropriate, the author's response is ethically questionable. The lie, though effective, isn't justified as a solution. The correct approach would be to set boundaries without deception. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
