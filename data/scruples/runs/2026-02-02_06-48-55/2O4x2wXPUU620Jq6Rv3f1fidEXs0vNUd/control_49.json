The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who made up the story about the swingers party is in the wrong. The situation is about a cashier commenting on their purchase, which the person found annoying. They responded with a lie to shut the cashier up and make them stop asking questions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The cashier was doing their job, maybe trying to make small talk, but the customer felt it was inappropriate. The cashier's comment about the pineapple was seen as intrusive, so the person retaliated by lying. \n\nThe key points are: Did the cashier overstep? Was the customer justified in lying to stop the interaction? Also, if they keep doing this, would that be worse?\n\nOn one hand, people have the right to privacy regarding their purchases. Cashiers shouldn't pry into personal matters. The customer's frustration is valid if the cashier was being judgmental. But lying to them, even as a way to teach a lesson, might not be the best approach. It could be seen as deceptive and could potentially cause issues for the cashier if they are embarrassed or if the story gets back to others.\n\nHowever, if the cashier was consistently being intrusive, the customer might feel they have a right to protect their privacy. The question is whether the response was appropriate. Using a lie might be a form of passive-aggressive retaliation. The person might not be in the wrong if the cashier was being unprofessional. But if they continue this behavior, it could become problematic, as it's not a respectful way to handle the situation.\n\nSo, considering the initial situation, the cashier's behavior was probably unprofessional. The customer's lie was a response to that. Whether they are in the wrong depends on the context. Since the cashier was making a judgment, the customer might not be in the wrong for using a white lie to stop the interaction. But if they keep doing it, maybe that's worse. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) for the initial instance, but A if they continued. But the question specifically asks about the one instance and whether continuing would be worse. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for the one instance. Given that, the answer might be B because the cashier was in the wrong first, and the customer took a stance to protect their privacy.\n"
