The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making up stories to stop cashiers from commenting on their purchases.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is annoyed by cashiers making comments or asking about their purchases. They gave an example where a cashier criticized spending on a pineapple, which embarrassed them. Then, to shut the cashier up, they lied about buying peppers for a swingers party. The cashier stopped talking after that.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, lying to someone, even if it's a cashier, can be seen as deceptive. The cashier is just doing their job, making small talk. While the cashier's comments might be intrusive, the author's response was to fabricate a story that's potentially offensive or untrue. That could be hurtful or offensive to the cashier. Also, if the author continues this behavior, it might lead to more issues, like the cashier feeling disrespected or the author facing consequences if caught lying.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that the cashier's comments are inappropriate. They might believe they have a right to privacy regarding their purchases. However, the solution of lying might not be the best approach. A better strategy might be to politely decline to answer or use a neutral response without inventing a falsehood.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is generally valued. Lying to avoid social interaction might be a personal choice, but it's still a lie. The cashier isn't obligated to know the reason, so the author could have just said they don't want to discuss it. Using a made-up story, especially one that could be sensitive (like a swingers party), might be crossing a line.\n\nSo, while the cashier's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response is also problematic. They could have handled it without deception. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
