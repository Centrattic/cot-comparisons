The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who made up a story to stop cashiers from questioning their purchases is in the wrong. The scenario involves a cashier commenting on a purchase, which the person found annoying, so they lied about attending a swingers party to make the cashier stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The person feels that cashiers shouldn't comment on purchases, which is a valid point. However, their response was to fabricate a story. Lying to someone, even if it's to stop them from being intrusive, could be seen as manipulative. \n\nThe cashier might not have had malicious intent; maybe they were just being nosy or trying to make small talk. The user's solution was to make the cashier uncomfortable with a false story. While the intention was to teach a lesson, using deception might escalate the situation or cause misunderstandings. \n\nAlso, if the author continues this behavior, it could become a pattern. Repeatedly lying might be seen as dishonest and could harm interactions. However, the person might feel justified if they believe the cashiers are overstepping. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, honesty is generally valued. Even if the cashier was intrusive, lying isn't the most appropriate response. The person could have addressed the issue differently, like politely asking the cashier not to comment. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's action was a lie to manipulate the cashier's reaction. While the cashier's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response is ethically questionable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
