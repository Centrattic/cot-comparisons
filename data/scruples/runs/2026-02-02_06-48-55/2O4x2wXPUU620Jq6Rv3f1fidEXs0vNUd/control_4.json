The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making up a story to stop cashiers from asking about their purchases.\n\nFirst, the cashier's behavior: They're making comments or asking questions about purchases. The user finds this intrusive and annoying. In one instance, the cashier criticized spending on a pineapple, which embarrassed the user. Then, when asked about buying multiple peppers, the user lied about a swingers' party to shut them up.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here involve ethics and social norms. The cashier's actions might be overstepping, but the user's response was a lie. Even if the intent is to teach a lesson, lying isn't typically seen as acceptable behavior. The user's method of making the cashier stop was to be offensive, which could be considered a harsh reaction. Also, using a false statement about a sensitive topic like a swingers' party could escalate awkwardness or cause harm. If the user continues this, it might not just be a one-time thing but a pattern of dishonesty. \n\nWhile the cashier's behavior is questionable, the user's response involves deception. The right answer usually leans towards not condoning lying, even if the motivation is to correct someone else's behavior. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
