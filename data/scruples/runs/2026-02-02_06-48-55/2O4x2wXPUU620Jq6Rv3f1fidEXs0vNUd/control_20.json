The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making up stories to stop cashiers from commenting on their purchases.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author gets annoyed when cashiers question their purchases. They had a bad experience where a cashier criticized buying a pineapple, leading to embarrassment. Later, when asked again, the author lied about a swingers party to shut the cashier up. They're wondering if this was wrong and if continuing similar tactics would be bad.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's intention was to stop the cashier's comments, which they found inappropriate. The response given was a lie meant to make the cashier uncomfortable and stop talking. \n\nNow, considering ethics. Lying is generally frowned upon, but context matters. The cashier was overstepping by commenting on a private purchase. The author's lie was a form of self-defense against what they perceived as harassment. However, lying can be problematic because it involves deception. Even if the cashier was being intrusive, the author chose a deceptive method to stop the interaction. \n\nAnother angle: The cashier is just doing their job, trying to make small talk. The author might have valid privacy concerns. But lying could escalate the situation or create discomfort for the cashier. Also, if they continue this behavior with different cashiers, it might become a pattern of manipulation through falsehoods. \n\nThere's a difference between standing up for your privacy and using deceit. The author might not be in the wrong because they were protecting their privacy from what they felt was an intrusion. But there's also a case that lying is still lying, regardless of the reason. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people do sometimes lie to avoid awkward situations. However, in this case, the lie was meant to teach a lesson and stop the cashier from continuing. The cashier's behavior was inappropriate, so the author's response could be seen as a justified reaction. \n\nBut then again, the cashier might not have intended harm, just small talk. The author's reaction might be disproportionate. The question is whether the lie was an appropriate response. \n\nSo, considering all that, there's a balance between respecting privacy and the use of deception. The cashier's actions were possibly overstepping, but the author's response could be seen as a reasonable way to assert privacy. However, lying is still a negative action, so the author might be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe not, because the cashier was the one who initiated the intrusive conversation. The author was defending their privacy. So, the answer could be either way. However, in ethical terms, even if the cashier was wrong, the author's lie could still be considered wrong because they chose deception. \n\nAlternatively, if the cashier was being inconsiderate, the author's response was a way to set a boundary, which is a valid action. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the lie was a proportional response. Since the cashier's comment was public and embarrassing, the author's lie was a direct way to stop it. However, lying is generally not encouraged. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they were asserting their privacy, but they might be in the wrong for lying. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that the cashier was overstepping, the author's action could be seen as justified.\n"
