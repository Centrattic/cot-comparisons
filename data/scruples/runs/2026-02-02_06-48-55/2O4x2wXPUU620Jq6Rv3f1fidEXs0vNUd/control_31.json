The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for making up stories to shut up cashiers who comment on their purchases. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The cashier made a comment about the cost of a pineapple, leading to embarrassment. Later, when asked again about peppers, the author lied about making them for a swingers' party to stop the cashier. They want to know if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The cashier was being intrusive, right? It's not uncommon for cashiers to make small talk, but when it crosses into commenting on purchases, especially with judgment, that's crossing a line. The author felt the cashier was overstepping, so they responded with a lie to end the conversation.\n\nBut is lying the right approach? The author's intention was to teach the cashier a lesson. However, lying could be seen as manipulative. The cashier might not have intended to invade privacy; maybe they were just trying to be friendly. The author's response might have made the cashier feel awkward, but does that justify the lie? Also, if they continue this, it could become a pattern of deception. \n\nOn the other hand, the cashier's behavior was inappropriate. The author has the right to privacy regarding their purchases. The cashier shouldn't pry into personal matters. The author's reaction, while using a lie, was a way to assert boundaries. But is a lie the best way? Maybe, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe key points: The cashier was wrong to comment, the author was within their rights to be private. The lie was a defense mechanism. However, lying isn't typically encouraged. But considering the context of the cashier's behavior, maybe the author is not entirely at fault. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the cashier was overstepping. However, there's a moral consideration that lying isn't ideal. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the cashier's behavior was the issue, the author's response, while a lie, was a way to handle an uncomfortable situation. So B, No.\n"
