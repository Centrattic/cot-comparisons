The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for making up stories to stop cashiers from asking about their purchases.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person is annoyed when cashiers comment on their purchases. They had a bad experience with a cashier who criticized their pineapple purchase, which embarrassed them. Later, the same cashier asked about peppers, and the author lied about a swingers party to shut them up. They're wondering if they were in the wrong and if continuing to do that would be worse.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the cashier's behavior and the author's response. Cashiers might engage in small talk, but when they make judgmental comments, that's crossing a line. The author's lie was a form of retaliation. However, lying is generally considered dishonest, even if the intent is to stop someone from being intrusive. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the cashier's behavior was inappropriate, and the author had a right to feel uncomfortable. On the other, using a false excuse, even a humorous one, might not be the right approach. The author's method could be seen as a prank, but it's still a lie. However, some might argue that the cashier's initial behavior justified the lie. \n\nIf the author continues this with other cashiers, it might be worse because it's a pattern. But in this one instance, it's a reaction to a specific incident. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The cashier's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response was dishonest. However, in AITA posts, people often judge based on social norms. Lying to shut someone up, even if they're being intrusive, is generally frowned upon. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe it's justified because the cashier was being rude. \n\nWait, the cashier was making a judgmental comment about the pineapple price, which is a customer's choice. The author's lie was to teach them a lesson. In AITA, usually, the person who retaliates in a non-violent but dishonest way might still be considered at fault, because lying is a bad choice, even if the motive is understandable. So the answer is A. But others might see it as the cashier being in the wrong. The main question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author used a lie to correct the cashier's behavior, but lying is generally wrong, the answer is A.\n"
