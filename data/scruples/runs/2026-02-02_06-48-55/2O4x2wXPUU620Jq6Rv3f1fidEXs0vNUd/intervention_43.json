The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making up a story to shut up a cashier. The original situation: the cashier was being annoying by commenting on the price of a pineapple and then later asking why they bought so many peppers. The author responded with a lie about a swingers party potluck, which worked to stop the cashier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of lying in this context. The author's intention was to make the cashier stop talking because they found the questions inappropriate. While the cashier was being intrusive, using a lie to shut them up might be seen as an overreaction. Swingers parties are a sensitive topic, and making that up could be considered offensive or hurtful, even if the intent was to teach a lesson.\n\nThen, the follow-up question is about continuing to use similar responses. If the author keeps lying about their purchases with other cashiers, that could lead to more issues. For example, if someone else gets uncomfortable or if the stories become more extreme, it might be considered manipulative or rude.\n\nBut also, cashiers often engage in small talk, and some people might find that intrusive. The author's right to privacy versus the cashier's attempt at conversation. However, lying to a cashier, even if it's to avoid awkward questions, is still dishonest. The cashier isn't necessarily overstepping their bounds unless they're being explicitly judgmental or violating company policy.\n\nAnother angle: the author's action was a form of self-defense against harassment. If the cashier was being aggressive or making the author uncomfortable, then the lie could be a way to assert boundaries. But in most cases, cashiers asking why you're buying something specific is just small talk, not harassment. The author could have responded with a simple \"none of your business\" without inventing a potentially offensive scenario.\n\nAlso, the potential consequences. The cashier might have taken the comment seriously or been offended. The author's lie could spread, especially if the cashier is part of a community where such stories might be shared. That could cause unnecessary harm or stigma.\n\nSo, while the cashier's behavior might be annoying, the author's response was a lie that could be seen as going too far. The answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because lying to a cashier, even for a reason they find valid, is generally not considered appropriate. It's better to handle such situations with a polite but firm boundary, like not engaging or changing the subject without dishonesty.\n"
