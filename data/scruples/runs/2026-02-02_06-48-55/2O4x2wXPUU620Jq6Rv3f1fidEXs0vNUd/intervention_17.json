The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for making up stories to stop cashiers from asking about their purchases.\n\nThe situation is that the author gets annoyed by cashiers commenting on their purchases. The example given is about a cashier criticizing their purchase of a pineapple. Later, when another cashier asked about buying multiple peppers, the author lied about making peppers for a swingers potluck to shut them up. They want to know if they're in the wrong for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is lying to avoid awkwardness or judgment. But is that justified? The cashier was just making small talk, which is common in retail. However, commenting on someone's purchases, especially in a judgmental way, can be intrusive. The cashier's behavior might be inappropriate, but does that justify the author's lie?\n\nLying can be seen as manipulative. Even if the cashier was being inconsiderate, the author's response could have other consequences. For example, the cashier might feel embarrassed or upset by the false comment. Also, if the author continues this tactic with other cashiers, it might become a pattern of dishonesty.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's right to privacy is a factor. Customers might feel uncomfortable explaining their purchases. The cashier overstepped by persisting and making a comment. The author's reaction is a form of self-defense against unwanted intrusion.\n\nBut does making up a story to teach a lesson cross a line? The intention was to stop the cashier from commenting, but the method involves deception. Even if the cashier was wrong to comment, the author's response could be seen as an excessive reaction. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the act of lying, even for a reason, might still be considered in the wrong because it's misleading and could be hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the cashier's behavior was inappropriate, but the author's lie is a form of retaliation that's also inconsiderate. The author might be in the wrong because they chose deception over other methods like just not responding or politely asking the cashier to stop. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
