The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who made up a story to stop a cashier from commenting on their purchase is in the wrong. The situation involves a cashier making a comment about spending a lot on a pineapple and later asking about peppers. The person responds with a lie about a swingers party potluck to shut the cashier up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The cashier was making small talk, which is common in many service roles. But the cashier's comments were intrusive and made the customer uncomfortable. The customer's response was a white lie to end the conversation. \n\nOn one hand, lying isn't typically seen as a good solution, but the cashier was overstepping. The customer had a right to privacy about their purchases. However, the lie was a bit extreme and could be seen as manipulative. \n\nBut the cashier was the one who initiated an uncomfortable conversation. The customer's action was a way to set boundaries. So, technically, the cashier's behavior was the issue. The customer's lie was a reaction to that. \n\nNow, the question is whether the customer is at fault. If the cashier was overstepping, then the customer's response is a way to protect their privacy. But the lie could have caused unnecessary embarrassment if the cashier took it seriously. However, the cashier didn't press further, so maybe it was effective. \n\nIn similar situations, people often use exaggerated or humorous responses to deflect. It's a form of self-defense in social interactions. So, while lying isn't ideal, the context of the cashier's behavior might justify it. \n\nThe answer here would likely be No (B), because the cashier was the one acting inappropriately, and the customer's response was a way to assert their privacy. However, the lie might not be the best method, but the fault isn't entirely on the customer. They were reacting to an uncomfortable situation. So B makes sense.\n"
