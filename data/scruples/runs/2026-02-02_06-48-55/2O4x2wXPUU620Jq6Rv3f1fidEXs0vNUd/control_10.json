The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making up stories to stop cashiers from asking about their purchases.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author gets annoyed when cashiers comment on their purchases, like when someone was upset about spending a lot on a pineapple. Then, the author made up a story about a swingers party to shut the cashier up. They want to know if they're in the wrong for that and if continuing this behavior would be bad.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the intention and the impact. The author's intention was to stop the cashier from asking questions by making the cashier uncomfortable. They felt the cashier was being inconsiderate, so they wanted to teach them a lesson. But is lying and making up something like a swingers party an appropriate response?\n\nLying to someone, even if they're a cashier, can be seen as unethical. The cashier might have been just trying to make small talk, even if it was intrusive. The author's response could be considered mocking or intentionally embarrassing the cashier. That might not be the best way to handle the situation. Instead of lying, maybe the author could have asked the cashier to stop the conversation politely.\n\nAlso, if the author continues this behavior with other cashiers, it could become a pattern of dishonesty and potentially cause more awkward situations or even harm the cashier's feelings if they didn't realize it was a joke. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the staff, assuming the cashier's intent is negative when it's just small talk.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier did make a comment that the author found offensive. But the response was to lie in a way that's clearly a joke but might not be taken that way. The cashier might feel belittled or uncomfortable. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was to stop the intrusive questions, but the method of doing so is questionable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong for using a deceptive and potentially hurtful response. The right approach would be to set boundaries without deceit. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
