The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about making up stories to stop cashiers from asking why they bought certain items.\n\nFirst, the cashier in the first example was being judgmental about the pineapple purchase, which embarrassed the author. Then, the author lied about the peppers being for a swingers' party to shut the cashier up. The author claims they want to teach the cashier a lesson because they think commenting on purchases is inappropriate.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are the use of deception to avoid unwanted interaction and the potential consequences. The author's intention was to stop the cashier from commenting, but lying could lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings if the cashier takes it the wrong way. Also, if the author continues this behavior, it might become a pattern of manipulation in customer service interactions. \n\nHowever, the cashier was being intrusive, so the author's motivation was to avoid awkwardness. But lying isn't the best solution. A better approach might be to set boundaries without deceit. The author's action was a response to a previous bad experience, but it's still a lie. \n\nOn one hand, the cashier's behavior was unprofessional, but the author's response is also unprofessional. The author's method could be seen as a form of punishment for the cashier's unprofessionalism. However, lying to someone in their job role might not be the right approach. \n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is generally valued, so the author is in the wrong for lying. The alternative solutions, like a polite but firm refusal to answer, would be more appropriate. The author's actions could also set a precedent for others to do the same, which might not be a good solution for the problem.\n"
