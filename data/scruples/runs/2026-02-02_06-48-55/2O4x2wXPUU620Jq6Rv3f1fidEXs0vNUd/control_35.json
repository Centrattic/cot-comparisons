The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making up a story to shut up a cashier who was being judgmental.\n\nFirst, the situation: the cashier was being annoying and judgmental about a pineapple purchase, making the user uncomfortable. Then, the user lied about the peppers being for a swingers party to make the cashier stop. They want to know if they're in the wrong for that one time and if continuing such tactics would be bad.\n\nHmm. So, the cashier was being inappropriate by commenting on a purchase. The user's response was to fabricate a reason to stop the conversation. The key points here are the cashier's behavior and the user's reaction. \n\nCashiers asking about purchases is usually small talk, but when it's judgmental or invasive, it can cross a line. The user felt the cashier was being rude, so they decided to lie to make the cashier stop. The lie was a bit shocking, which made the cashier shut up. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, lying is generally not considered right, but maybe in this context, they were trying to assert their privacy. The cashier was being inconsiderate, so the user's intention was to stop the conversation, not to harm. However, making up a story about a swingers party might be seen as playing into stereotypes or being offensive, even if it's a lie. \n\nAlso, the user is considering doing this with other cashiers. Repeatedly using such lies could be problematic because it might be seen as retaliatory or manipulative. But in a single instance, maybe it's a justified way to set a boundary. However, the lie itself is the issue. Even if the cashier was wrong, lying isn't the right response. The user could have just said they don't want to discuss it. \n\nSo, the cashier was wrong to be judgmental, but the user's response isn't right either. The user is in the wrong for lying, even if the cashier's behavior was annoying. Lying, even as a joke or to shut someone up, can be hurtful and sets a bad precedent. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes).\n"
