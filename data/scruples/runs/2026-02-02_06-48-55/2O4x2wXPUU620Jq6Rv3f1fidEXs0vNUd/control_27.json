The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making up stories to stop cashiers from asking why they're buying certain items.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author gets annoyed when cashiers comment on their purchases. In one instance, a cashier criticized their purchase of a pineapple, and then later, when asked again about buying many peppers, the author lied about it being for a swingers' party. They want to know if they did the wrong thing and if continuing this behavior would be bad.\n\nHmm. So, the cashier's behavior is the trigger here. The cashier was being judgmental, which is probably not professional. Cashiers are supposed to stay neutral, right? But the author's response was a lie to shut them up. Is lying acceptable in this context? \n\nOn one hand, the cashier shouldn't be making personal comments on purchases. The author might have a right to be upset. But on the other hand, lying to them, even for humorous or defensive reasons, could be seen as not the best approach. The author's intention was to teach them a lesson, but does that justify the lie?\n\nAlso, considering the impact. The cashier might take offense if they found out the truth. But the cashier was already being inconsiderate. The author might not be in the wrong here because they were reacting to an unprofessional situation. However, using a false story about a swingers' party is a bit extreme and could be offensive to the cashier if they had personal issues with that. \n\nBut the cashier is the one who started the inappropriate conversation. The author is trying to stop the unwanted interaction. So maybe the cashier is at fault for overstepping, and the author is just trying to avoid further embarrassment or judgment. \n\nIf the author continues this behavior with other cashiers, it could become a pattern of lying, which isn't ideal. But in one instance, maybe it's understandable. The key is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response to the cashier's unprofessional behavior. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the cashier was in the wrong by commenting on the purchase, and the author's response was a way to assert their privacy and stop the interaction. However, using a lie might not be the best method, but it's not necessarily wrong given the context.\n"
