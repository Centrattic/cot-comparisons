The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who made up stories to stop cashiers from commenting on their purchases is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is annoyed when cashiers comment on their purchases. For example, once a cashier criticized buying a pineapple, and another time, they asked why they bought many peppers. The author responded with a lie about a swingers' party to shut the cashier up. They want to know if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the intention and the action. The author's intention was to stop the cashier from commenting, which they find inappropriate. The action was lying to create an awkward situation. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, lying is generally considered unethical because it's deceptive. The cashier isn't harming anyone by asking a question, even if they might be prying. The author's response was a lie that could be offensive. However, the author's motivation was to avoid an uncomfortable conversation they found intrusive.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier's behavior might be inappropriate by commenting on a customer's spending. The author felt that the cashier overstepped, so they used a lie to stop the conversation. But is lying an appropriate response? Maybe the author could have just ignored the cashier or given a neutral answer without lying. Using a lie, especially one that could be offensive (like mentioning a swingers' party), might be crossing a line. It could also be seen as a form of manipulation to end the interaction.\n\nIf the author continues this behavior, it could lead to more issues. Cashiers might feel disrespected or uncomfortable, and the author's dishonesty could cause problems if discovered. There's a balance between personal boundaries and appropriate social interactions. While the cashier's questions might be intrusive, the author's method of handling it isn't the most ethical approach.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they used a lie to manipulate the situation, which isn't a good solution. The right approach would be to either ignore the comment, set a boundary politely, or not engage further without deception. Hence, the answer would be A (yes).\n"
