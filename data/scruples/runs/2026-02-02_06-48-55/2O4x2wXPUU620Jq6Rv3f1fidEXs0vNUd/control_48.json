The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about making up stories to avoid cashiers commenting on their purchases.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author is annoyed when cashiers ask why they're buying certain items, like the pineapple example where the cashier made a judgmental comment. In response, they told a lie about a swingers party to shut the cashier up. They're asking if they're at fault for doing that once and if they would be if they did it again.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether lying to a cashier in this context is wrong. The cashier's behavior was intrusive and judgmental, which is probably why the author felt the need to respond. The author's intention was to teach the cashier a lesson and stop the intrusive questioning. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, lying is generally considered wrong, but context matters. If the cashier was overstepping by commenting on a customer's spending, the author might feel justified in setting boundaries. However, the method used\u2014a false and potentially offensive story\u2014could be seen as a harsh response. The cashier might not have intended harm but was just being nosy. The author's response could be seen as a form of retaliation, which might not be the most appropriate way to handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier's behavior was unprofessional. Cashiers should focus on their job without prying into customers' personal reasons for purchases. The author's lie might have been a way to assert their privacy, but using a fabricated scenario that's controversial (like a swingers party) might not be the best approach. It could be seen as using someone else's potential awkwardness to make a point, which could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nConsidering both sides, the cashier was in the wrong for commenting on the purchase, but the author's response was also inappropriate. Lying to a cashier, even if the cashier was being intrusive, isn't the right way to handle it. The author should have found a more respectful way to set boundaries or simply ignored the comments without resorting to deception. Therefore, the author is at fault for their response, even if the cashier's actions were unprofessional.\n"
