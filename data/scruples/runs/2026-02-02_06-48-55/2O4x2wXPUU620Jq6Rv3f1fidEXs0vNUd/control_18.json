The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who made up a story to avoid cashiers' questions is in the wrong. The scenario is that the cashier was being annoying by commenting on their purchase, like the pineapple example. Then, the person lied about a swingers party to shut the cashier up.\n\nHmm, so I need to decide if that's wrong. The question is about accountability and whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the cashier was being intrusive by asking why they bought so many peppers. The customer might feel their privacy was invaded. But lying to the cashier, even if it's to stop them from commenting, could be seen as dishonest. However, the cashier was crossing a line. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the cashier's comments were inappropriate and they wanted to teach them a lesson. But is lying an acceptable response? Maybe not. Lying can have consequences, like if the cashier takes it the wrong way or if it leads to misunderstandings. Also, while the cashier might be overstepping, the customer could have just ignored the question instead of lying. \n\nBut then again, the cashier was being judgmental about a pineapple purchase, which is trivial. The customer has a right to privacy regarding their purchases. The lie was effective in stopping the conversation. However, making up a story about a swingers party might be an overreaction. It's a false statement, even if it's meant to shut down the interaction. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they're defending their privacy. On the other, they're being deceptive. It's a bit of a moral dilemma. But in terms of societal norms, while the cashier was rude, the customer's lie might be considered wrong because it's intentionally misleading someone. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes), because even though the cashier was being intrusive, lying isn't the appropriate way to handle it. There are better ways to avoid the conversation, like a non-answer or a polite \"just for a recipe.\" The made-up story, especially about a sensitive topic like a swingers party, could be hurtful or offensive, even if the cashier didn't react negatively this time. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
