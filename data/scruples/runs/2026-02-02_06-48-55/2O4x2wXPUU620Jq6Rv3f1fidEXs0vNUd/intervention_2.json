The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about making up stories to stop cashiers from asking why they're buying certain items.\n\nFirst, the author explains they get annoyed when cashiers comment on their purchases. They had a bad experience with a cashier who criticized their purchase of a pineapple. Later, when another cashier asked about buying multiple peppers, the author lied about making stuffed peppers for a swingers' party to shut them up. Now they're wondering if they're at fault and what would happen if they continued this tactic.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are deception and the intent behind it. The author's intention was to make the cashier stop by making the situation awkward. The lie was meant to teach the cashier a lesson about commenting on purchases.\n\nDeception for personal convenience can be considered morally wrong. Even if the cashier was being intrusive, lying to them isn't the right approach. The author's action might have worked in the short term, but it's not a respectful solution. It could lead to misunderstandings or offend someone else if the cashier takes the comment seriously or if others hear it.\n\nAlso, using a lie about a swingers party could be hurtful or inappropriate. The author's goal was to stop the cashier from commenting, but the method chosen was to deceive, which is unethical. There might be better ways to avoid the conversation, like a simple response without inventing a story.\n\nSo, considering the intent and the method, the author is likely in the wrong. They chose deception which is morally questionable, even if the initial provocation was the cashier's intrusive behavior.\n"
