The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for making up stories to stop cashiers from asking about their purchases.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The person is annoyed by cashiers commenting on their purchases. In one instance, a cashier criticized the cost of a pineapple, making the person uncomfortable. Later, when another cashier asked about buying peppers, the person lied about a swingers' party to shut them up. They're asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is using deceptive tactics to avoid awkward interactions. The cashier's actions might be seen as intrusive, but the author's response is a lie. \n\nI should consider both sides. The cashier's behavior could be inappropriate, but the customer's response is to fabricate a story. While the cashier might be overstepping, the author's method of dealing with it is dishonest. Lying, even if it's to shut someone up, could have consequences. For example, if the cashier feels disrespected, or if the lie could cause misunderstandings in the future.\n\nAlso, the author is considering doing this again. Repeated use of such tactics might escalate the situation or lead to negative reactions from others. It's a form of manipulation, which is generally frowned upon, even if the intent is to avoid uncomfortable conversations.\n\nOn the other hand, the cashier shouldn't be commenting on personal purchases. The author has the right to privacy, but responding dishonestly isn't the most ethical way to handle it. There are other methods to avoid the conversation, like a simple \"just for dinner\" without elaborating.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the cashier's actions might be at fault for overstepping, the author's choice to lie is still a moral issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since lying is generally considered wrong, even in this context, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
