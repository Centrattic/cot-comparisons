The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for making up stories to stop cashiers from asking about their purchases.\n\nFirst, the situation: The cashier made a comment about the price of a pineapple, making the author uncomfortable. Later, when another cashier asked about buying peppers, the author lied, saying it was for a swingers' party. The cashier stopped talking. The author wants to know if they're in the wrong and if continuing this behavior would be bad.\n\nHmm, well, lying to cashiers by making up stories like that seems like a problem. The cashier is just doing their job, maybe trying to be friendly. The author's response was to use a potentially offensive or untrue story to shut them up. Even if the cashier was being nosy, lying isn't the right approach. It could cause misunderstandings or offense. Also, if the author continues this, it might lead to more issues, like the cashiers being uncomfortable or reporting the customer. The author's intent was to teach a lesson, but that's not a good reason to lie. Respectful communication is better than deception. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
