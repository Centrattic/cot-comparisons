The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they did the right thing by making up stories to stop cashiers from commenting on their purchases. They mentioned a specific instance where a cashier was critical about the price of a pineapple, and later, to shut the cashier up, they lied about buying peppers for a swingers' potluck. Now they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The cashier was making a comment that the person found annoying or inappropriate. By lying, the person wanted to teach the cashier a lesson and stop the conversation. But is lying the right approach here? \n\nOn one hand, the cashier might have been overstepping by commenting on the customer's purchase. It's generally considered bad service to pry into a customer's reasons unless there's a security concern. So the cashier's behavior might not be appropriate. \n\nHowever, the customer's response was to fabricate a story. While it stopped the conversation, it involved deception. The cashier might not have realized they were being taught a lesson. The customer's intention was to make the cashier feel awkward, which is a form of revenge. But is that acceptable? \n\nAlso, if the customer continues this behavior with other cashiers, it could lead to more awkward situations or even spread misinformation. The customer's solution might not be the healthiest way to handle the issue. A better approach might be to not engage, ignore the cashier, or politely decline to answer without lying. \n\nBut then again, the cashier's initial comment was intrusive. The customer might feel that their privacy was invaded. However, using a lie to retaliate could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nI think the key here is whether the customer's actions are in the wrong. The cashier's behavior isn't ideal, but the customer's solution involves deception. While the cashier's comments were unwelcome, lying to shut them up isn't the right response. The customer is in the wrong because they used a lie to manipulate the situation instead of addressing the issue respectfully. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they lied to teach someone a lesson, which is a form of dishonesty and manipulation.\n"
