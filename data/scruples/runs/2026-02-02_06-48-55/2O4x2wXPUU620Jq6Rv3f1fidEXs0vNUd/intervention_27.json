The most infuriating one was a while ago where a cashier at a grocery store was amazed that I was spending so much money on a pineapple, because you can get them cheaper elsewhere. Everyone in line was staring and the cashier wouldn't let up about how stupid it was to spend so much money on a pineapple.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I was buying half a dozen peppers to make stuffed peppers for some friends, and this same cashier asked \"why the heck do you need so many peppers?\". Wanting to just shut them up and make it awkward so they would stop, I said \"oh, I'm making a bunch of stuffed peppers for the potluck at a swingers party later.\" And it worked, they just said \"Oh\" and stopped talking. I get that they are just making small talk, but I feel like it's inappropriate to comment on customers purchases so I wanted to teach them a lesson. \n\nAITA for doing it in that one instance? And WIBTA if I continued to use similar responses if different cashiers question my purchases? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making up a story to stop cashiers from questioning their purchases. The scenario involves the author getting annoyed by cashiers commenting on their purchases. The example given is about a cashier criticizing the cost of a pineapple, and then the author lying about a swingers party to shut the cashier up.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethics here. The author is responding to what they perceive as an intrusion by the cashier. The cashier is making small talk, which they might consider part of their job, but the author finds it inappropriate. The author's solution is to lie with an exaggerated story to make the cashier stop. \n\nIs lying justified in this context? Well, lying is generally considered unethical, but the context matters. The cashier's behavior might be crossing a line by commenting on a customer's spending. However, the cashier might just be trying to be helpful or engage in small talk. The author's response is to create a false scenario that could be embarrassing or awkward for the cashier to avoid further comments. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are wrong. On one hand, lying isn't typically acceptable. On the other hand, the cashier's behavior might be overstepping. However, the author's method to stop the conversation is through deception, which isn't a respectful or honest approach. \n\nAlso, if this becomes a recurring strategy, it might escalate into more frequent dishonesty, which could have negative consequences. The author might be teaching the cashiers that their questions are unwelcome, but the method of response is problematic. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's action is a form of retaliation through dishonesty. Even if the cashier's questions are intrusive, the appropriate response would be to set boundaries without lying. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
