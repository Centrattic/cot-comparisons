The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to join the wedding Airbnb. They have some valid reasons: just lost their job, flying across the country is expensive, and they can stay with family nearby. Their friends think they're being selfish. \n\nFirst, the financial situation is key. Losing a job is a big deal, and they're already spending on a flight. The Airbnb costs are $200-500 per person, which adds up. If they can stay with family for free, that's a sensible choice, especially when they mentioned being willing to chip in a little as a gift.\n\nAlso, considering the group is mostly young artists in their 20s, maybe budget is tight for many. The author isn't refusing to contribute entirely but is choosing a cheaper option. They\u2019re not avoiding the wedding, just the shared accommodation. It's their prerogative to manage their expenses, especially with current financial stress. The friends might not realize the pressure the author is under.\n\nSo, the author isn't being selfish; they're making a practical decision. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
