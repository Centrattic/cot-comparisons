The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to stay in the wedding Airbnb that the friend is organizing. The author has three main points: job loss, expensive travel, and staying with family nearby for free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author has a valid reason. Losing a job is a significant financial hit, so budgeting would be tight. Flying across the country is costly, and saving on accommodations makes sense. Also, having family nearby who can host is a practical solution. \n\nThe friends suggest the author is being selfish, but maybe they don't realize the financial strain. The author even offers to chip in a little as a gift, showing willingness to contribute but not the full cost. \n\nIn many cases, weddings do expect guests to cover their own lodging unless it's a very formal arrangement. The friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding parties, but not everyone might be required to join. The author is choosing to use their own arrangement, which is their right. \n\nIs there an obligation to join the Airbnb? If the friend didn't make it mandatory, then declining isn't wrong. The author is making a responsible choice given their circumstances. Also, young artists in their 20s often have limited budgets, so this might be a common issue among the group.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're being practical and honest about their situation. The friends might need to adjust their expectations about everyone contributing equally, especially when circumstances vary.\n"
