The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The person is declining to stay in the AirBnB arranged by their friend for the wedding because they can stay with family nearby for free. They mention financial difficulties after losing a job and the cost of flying across the country. Their friends say they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The main points are:\n\n1. The person is in a tough financial situation (job loss).\n2. They\u2019re already spending a lot on a flight.\n3. They have a free alternative (staying with family).\n4. The AirBnB is expensive ($200-500 per person).\n5. They don't want to pay for a shared room when they can have a free room.\n\nThe question is whether they're being selfish. Let's break it down. The friend organized the AirBnB, but it's up to each person to choose. The person isn't forcing others; they\u2019re making a personal choice based on their circumstances. They even mention being willing to chip in a little as a gift, which shows they\u2019re not entirely against helping. \n\nSelfishness would be if they were taking from others or refusing help when they needed it. Here, it's the opposite\u2014they're trying to save money because they can't afford it and have a free option. The friends might feel it's a group event, but weddings are personal events, and guests aren't obligated to participate in all costs unless specified. The author isn't causing harm; they\u2019re just managing their own budget. \n\nAlso, considering the context of young artists in their 20s, many might be in similar financial situations. The AirBnB cost is high, especially if it's split among people. The author's decision to stay with family is practical and responsible given their job loss. They're not rejecting the event itself, just the specific accommodation arrangement.\n\nSo the answer is likely B (No, they're not in the wrong). They\u2019re making a rational decision based on their financial situation and available options.\n"
