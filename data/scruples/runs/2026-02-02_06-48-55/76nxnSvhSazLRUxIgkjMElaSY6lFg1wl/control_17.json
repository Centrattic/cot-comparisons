The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to be included in the wedding Airbnb.\n\nFirst, the main points from the author's side: They lost their job, which adds financial stress. They're flying across the country, which is expensive. Their family lives close by, so they can stay for free. The friends are suggesting they should just pay for the Airbnb even though they can stay with family.\n\nThe friends think the author is being selfish. But the author is concerned about spending hundreds on a shared room when they have a free option. Also, they mention being willing to chip in a little as a gift. The group is young artists in their early 20s, maybe not all in stable financial situations.\n\nSo, the question is whether refusing to pay for the Airbnb makes them at fault. The key factors are financial hardship, alternative accommodations, and willingness to contribute a bit. \n\nWeddings often have various expenses, and guests might have different circumstances. The author isn't avoiding the wedding itself but just the specific accommodation choice. Since they have a free option and are offering to contribute a gift, it's reasonable to not want the Airbnb. Friends might not realize the financial strain of a job loss. \n\nSelfishness isn't the right term here; it's more about personal financial management. The author isn't making others pay more; they're just opting out of a shared expense they can't afford. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
