The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to participate in the wedding accommodations. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend is organizing an AirBnB for the wedding parties, costing $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to be part of this setup. Others think they're being selfish and should just pay. The author's reasons: lost job, flying across the country (expensive), and family nearby for free stay. They mention they might chip in a little as a gift but can't afford the full cost.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial hardship, alternative arrangements, and possible willingness to contribute a small amount. The friends are mostly young artists, which might mean many are on tight budgets too.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is in a tough spot financially. They have a valid reason not to participate\u2014job loss is a significant issue. The fact that they can stay with family for free is a legitimate alternative. Also, they're willing to contribute something, even if not the full amount. Others might argue that weddings are a time to support the couple, but the author isn't refusing to attend; they're just opting out of a costly arrangement. \n\nThe friends suggesting they are selfish might not be considering the author's financial situation. It's reasonable to make personal choices based on one's circumstances. The author isn't avoiding the event but making a choice that suits their situation. So, I think they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
