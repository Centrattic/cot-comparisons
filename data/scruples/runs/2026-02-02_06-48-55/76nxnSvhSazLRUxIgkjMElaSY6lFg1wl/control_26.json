The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to stay at the AirBnB the friend organized. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person doesn't want to be part of the group accommodations. The reasons given are: 1) just lost their job and it's causing financial strain, 2) already flying across the country which is expensive, and 3) family is nearby and they can stay there for free. Their friends think they're being selfish. The person is willing to chip in a little as a gift but not pay for the Airbnb.\n\nSo, the main question is whether declining to participate is selfish or reasonable. Let's consider financial hardship. Losing a job is a significant issue, especially for someone in their early 20s, maybe just starting out. The cost of the Airbnb ranges from $200-500 per person. If they have to pay that, plus flight costs, that's a lot. Plus, staying with family is free, which seems practical.\n\nThe friends might feel it's a group event and everyone should contribute equally. But the person is making a choice based on their circumstances. They're not forcing others; they're just opting out. Also, they're open to contributing a gift, which is kind. The fact that they're in a group of young artists suggests that financial stability might be an issue for many in the group as well.\n\nIs it selfish? Well, selfishness would imply they're making a choice that harms others without consideration. But here, the person is prioritizing their financial situation and using an available free option. They're not forcing others to pay more, and they're still attending the wedding. The friends might not realize the financial pressure from losing a job. So, the person's decision seems reasonable. Therefore, they're not in the wrong.\n"
