The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1.

My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, which costs $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to participate and is facing pressure to pay, with some friends calling them selfish.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: They just lost their job, which is a significant financial hit. They're flying across the country, which is another expense. Plus, their family lives 15 minutes away, so they can stay there for free. They mentioned they might chip in a little as a gift but can't afford the Airbnb.\n\nThe group is mostly young artists in their early 20s. The author wants to stay with friends but can't afford the Airbnb cost. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not participating.\n\nI need to consider if the friends' expectations are reasonable. Weddings often have shared accommodations to save costs, especially among friends. However, the author has valid financial constraints. They\u2019re already spending on a flight and have free accommodation. Forcing someone to pay for something they can't afford might be unreasonable. Also, the friends are suggesting they \"suck it up,\" which could be dismissive of the author's situation.\n\nThe key points are financial hardship, existing free option, and the willingness to contribute a little. The author isn't refusing to help but can't meet the full cost. The friends might be expecting everyone to chip in equally, but that might not account for individual circumstances. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
