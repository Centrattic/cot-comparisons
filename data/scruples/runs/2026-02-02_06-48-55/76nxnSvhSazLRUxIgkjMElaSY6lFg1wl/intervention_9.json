The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author declining to stay at the wedding Airbnb that friends are organizing, even though they can stay with family nearby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author lost their job, is flying across the country, and can stay with family. The Airbnb is expensive, ranging from $200 to $500 per person. The friends think they're being selfish for not participating, but the author is worried about the cost.\n\nThe key points here are financial hardship and personal circumstances. The author is facing unemployment, which is a significant financial burden. They're already spending a lot on airfare and can get free accommodation with family. The friends are young and maybe not as financially stable. The author isn't refusing to help; they're just declining a specific part of the event that's expensive for them. They also mention being open to chipping in a little as a gift, showing they're not completely unwilling to contribute.\n\nThe friends' criticism is about the author \"sucking it up\" and paying. But considering their current financial situation, it's reasonable to prioritize spending on necessary things like airfare. Staying with family is a practical solution that doesn't add to their financial stress. The author isn't avoiding the event entirely; they\u2019re still attending the wedding, which is the main point.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often hinges on whether the person is being unreasonable or inconsiderate. Here, the author is being upfront about their circumstances and making a choice that's understandable given their situation. The friends are in a different position since they might not have family nearby. The author isn't taking anything away from the wedding or the friends; they're just choosing a more affordable option. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re making a responsible decision based on their financial reality. The friends might not like it, but it's not selfish. The answer should be B.\n"
