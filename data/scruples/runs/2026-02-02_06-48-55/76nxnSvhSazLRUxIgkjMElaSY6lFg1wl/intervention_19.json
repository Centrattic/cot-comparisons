The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to stay in the group Airbnb for the wedding. The author has three main reasons: lost their job, flying across the country which is expensive, and family is nearby offering a free stay. Friends think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to weigh these circumstances. The author's financial situation is tough right now. Losing a job adds a lot of stress. Flying long distances is costly, so saving on accommodations makes sense. Also, having family nearby for free is a practical solution. The friends suggest contributing a bit as a gift, which the author is open to, but not paying the full price. \n\nIs it selfish to avoid the Airbnb? Maybe not. The friends are young and might not all have stable finances either. The author isn't refusing to help entirely, just not paying full price. It's about financial responsibility. The friends might not consider the author's current situation. \n\nThe key points are the author's financial hardship, the availability of a cheaper alternative, and willingness to contribute a little. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their circumstances. The friends' judgment may be harsh without knowing the full story. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
