The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author declining to stay in a shared Airbnb for the wedding, opting instead to stay with family nearby for free. Their reasons are job loss, flying across the country, and family proximity. Friends think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common values around weddings. Weddings often involve significant expenses, and friends might expect participation in shared costs. But the author has valid financial struggles. Losing a job is a major issue, and flying across the country is expensive. If they can get a free stay from family, that's a practical solution.\n\nThe friends' perspective is that it's selfish to avoid the Airbnb. Maybe they want everyone to be together, or they think splitting costs is fair since others are contributing. But the author isn't refusing to help entirely; they're willing to chip in a little as a gift. That shows some consideration.\n\nFinancial hardship is a legitimate reason to seek cheaper options. It's not about being cheap or selfish if you can't afford the same as others. The author isn't hiding their situation. They're making a choice that makes sense for their circumstances. Also, the Airbnb is expensive for a group of young artists, which is a demographic that might not have a lot of money. So maybe the friend organizing the Airbnb didn't consider different financial situations.\n\nThe key points are: the author has valid financial issues, they're willing to contribute a little, and there's a free alternative. They're not avoiding the wedding entirely. The friends' pushback might stem from not understanding the author's situation. In this context, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible financial decision without being inconsiderate.\n"
