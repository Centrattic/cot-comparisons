The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to participate in the wedding AirBnB set up.\n\nFirst, the author just lost their job, which adds financial stress. That's a significant point. Job loss can lead to immediate expenses, so budgeting becomes tight.\n\nSecond, the author is flying across the country to attend the wedding, which is already expensive. The travel costs might be a big hit, so spending more on accommodation might not be feasible.\n\nThird, the author's family is nearby, offering free stay. That's a practical solution. Why pay for an AirBnB when a free option is available? It's logical to take the free option, especially with financial constraints.\n\nThe friends think the author is being selfish. But the author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they're just not joining the group accommodation. They even mention willingness to contribute a little as a gift, which shows they aren't being completely stingy.\n\nAlso, the group is mostly young artists in their early 20s, which might mean they have varying financial situations. The author's situation seems valid given their current unemployment and travel costs.\n\nSo, the author is making a choice based on their financial reality. They aren't avoiding the event but are opting for a more economical choice. It's not about selfishness but about managing their budget during a difficult time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
