The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The main points from the post are:\n\n1. The friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, costing $200-$500 per person.\n2. The author doesn't want to be part of this setup.\n3. The author's reasons: recently unemployed, flying across the country (which is expensive), and can stay with family nearby for free.\n4. Friends think they're selfish for not paying.\n5. The group is mostly young artists in their 20s.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the arguments. The author has valid financial constraints. Losing a job is a significant event, leading to financial stress. Flying across the country is a big expense, so adding Airbnb costs might be a burden. Also, staying with family for free is a practical solution. The friends might feel it's a shared experience, but the author's circumstances are different. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect everyone to participate in the same accommodation? Weddings can be expensive, and guests often have varying budgets. If the author is already flying a long distance, they might have limited funds. Also, the fact that they're willing to chip in a little as a gift shows they're not entirely unwilling to contribute, just not the full Airbnb cost. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have communicated this earlier. However, the wedding is six months away, so there's time to sort it out. The friends might not consider the author's current situation, but the author has a legitimate reason. \n\nFinancial hardship is a common reason people might decline certain expenses. It's not selfish if they can't afford it. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they're just choosing a more economical option. So, they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
