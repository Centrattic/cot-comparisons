The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to join the wedding Airbnb setup. The author lost their job, is flying across the country, and can stay with family nearby for free. Their friends are suggesting they should pay for the Airbnb even though they don't want to.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author has valid financial reasons: job loss and an expensive flight. Staying with family is free, so it's logical for them to choose that to save money. The friends are part of a group that's organizing a shared stay, but it's not clear if the Airbnb is mandatory for everyone or just an option for those who don't have local family. \n\nIf the friend is offering the Airbnb as a choice but others are making the author feel they should participate, that's different from the friend forcing it. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they're just choosing a more affordable option. Also, being willing to chip in a little as a gift shows they're not entirely against contributing. \n\nFriendship shouldn't require financial sacrifice, especially when the author is facing job loss. The friends suggesting they are selfish might not be considering the author's current situation. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability. Answer B makes sense here.\n"
