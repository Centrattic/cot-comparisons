The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend organizing a wedding Airbnb for the weekend, costing $200-$500 per person, and the author doesn't want to be part of it. The reasons given are losing their job, the cost of flying across the country, and being able to stay with family nearby for free. Friends think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the author's position. They have valid financial constraints: job loss adds to their stress, and flying is already expensive. They can stay with family for free, which is a practical solution. The wedding is a big expense, and not everyone might have the means to contribute to the Airbnb. The author isn't refusing to attend but is choosing a cheaper option. \n\nThe friends suggest they should \"suck it up,\" but that might not consider the author's financial situation. The author is also open to chipping in a bit as a gift, showing they're willing to contribute but not at the cost of their own financial stability. \n\nWeddings can be stressful for guests, especially with the pandemic's lingering effects on jobs and finances. The key points here are the author's financial hardship and having an alternative. Since staying with family is free and they're not declining the invitation, it's reasonable for them to avoid the Airbnb cost. The friends might be viewing it as group pressure, but the author's circumstances are legitimate. \n\nSo, the answer should be B: No, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a responsible choice given their situation.\n"
