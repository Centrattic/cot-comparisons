The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to participate in the wedding Airbnb setup. The author's friend is organizing accommodations for the wedding party, which ranges from $200 to $500 per person for the weekend. The author has several reasons for not wanting to join: they lost their job, they're flying across the country (which is expensive), and their family is nearby, offering free accommodation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The friends think the author is being selfish and should pay. But the author's circumstances are valid. Losing a job is a significant financial hit. Traveling across the country isn't cheap, and staying with family is a cost-saving option. The author even offers to chip in a little as a gift, showing they aren't entirely opposed to contributing, just not to the extent of paying for an Airbnb when a free alternative exists.\n\nThe friends' perspective is that it's part of the wedding party experience, but the author is prioritizing their financial situation. Wedding costs can add up, and for someone in financial distress, this might be a necessary decision. Also, the group is mostly young artists early in their careers, which might mean many have limited budgets. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they're just choosing a more economical option. \n\nSelfishness would imply they're causing harm without considering others. Here, the author is making a personal choice that doesn't directly affect others negatively. The friends might feel excluded, but the author isn't forcing them to do anything. The key points are financial hardship and available alternatives. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible decision given their circumstances. Answer B.\n"
