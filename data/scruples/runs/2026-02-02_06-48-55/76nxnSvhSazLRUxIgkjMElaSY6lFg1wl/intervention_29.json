The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The scenario is that the friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding parties, which costs $200-$500 per person. The author doesn't want to join because they just lost their job, are flying across the country, and their family is nearby so they can stay for free. Friends say they're selfish, but the author is worried about the cost.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. Losing a job is a significant financial hit. Paying for an Airbnb on top of a flight could really strain their finances. Plus, staying with family is a free option, so they don't need to pay. The friends suggest they should just pay, but maybe they don't realize the author's financial situation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being willing to chip in a little as a gift. That shows they're not entirely against contributing, just not the full cost. The friends might be expecting everyone to participate equally, but the author has a valid reason to opt out. \n\nThe friends are mostly young artists, which might be a community where shared experiences are valued, but that doesn't mean the author has to sacrifice their financial stability. It's reasonable to make choices based on personal circumstances. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a legitimate reason to avoid the expense, and they're not refusing to contribute entirely. The friends might be misunderstanding their situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
