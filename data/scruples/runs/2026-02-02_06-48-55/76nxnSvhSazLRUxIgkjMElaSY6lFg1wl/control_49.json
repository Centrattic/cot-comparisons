The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for not wanting to join the wedding Airbnb.\n\nFirst, the main points from the question: The friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, costing $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to participate, and others think they're being selfish. The reasons given are that they just lost their job (financial hardship), they're flying across the country (so already spending a lot), and their family is nearby where they can stay for free. The friends are mostly young artists in their 20s.\n\nThe author is considering chipping in a little as a gift but can't afford the Airbnb. So the question is whether refusing to join the Airbnb makes them at fault.\n\nI need to evaluate if their decision is unreasonable. Financially, losing a job is a significant issue. The cost of the Airbnb on top of a flight is a lot to ask someone in that situation. Also, the fact that they have a free alternative (family nearby) means they can attend without the extra expense. The friends might argue it's about supporting the friend, but the author is already making a sacrifice by flying in. The offer to contribute a little shows willingness to help, just not the full Airbnb cost. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the Airbnb is part of the wedding plans that everyone is supposed to participate in, but the author's circumstances are valid. The friends' criticism as selfish seems harsh given the financial hardship. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're managing their own financial situation and have a viable alternative. The answer should be B (No).\n"
