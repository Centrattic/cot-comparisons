The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is at fault. The author is a friend who doesn't want to be part of the wedding Airbnb setup. The friend's reasoning includes losing a job, the cost of traveling across the country, and the ability to stay with family nearby. Some friends think the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is facing financial hardship after losing their job. They are already spending a lot on a flight, and staying with family is a free option. The friends think the author should just pay, but the author is worried about the cost of the Airbnb, which ranges from $200 to $500 per person for the weekend.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding, which is a major event. They are opting out of a group activity (the Airbnb) to save money. The author is in a financial situation where they need to cut costs, especially since they lost their job. Staying with family is a logical choice here.\n\nThe friends might feel that contributing to the Airbnb is a shared responsibility, but the author isn't avoiding the wedding itself. Also, the author is open to chipping in a little as a gift, which shows they aren't completely unwilling to contribute. They just can't afford the full cost of the Airbnb.\n\nConsidering that the author has a valid reason (financial hardship) and a viable alternative (family stay), it's reasonable for them to decline the Airbnb. Friends should understand that everyone has different financial situations. The author isn't being selfish; they're prioritizing their finances given their current circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons and are not avoiding the event, just choosing a more affordable option. The friends' suggestion that they should \"suck it up\" might be missing the point about the author's financial struggles.\n"
