The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend organizing a wedding Airbnb, and the author doesn't want to be part of it. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the author just lost their job, which is a significant financial hit. That's a major point in their favor because they're probably struggling financially right now. Then, they're flying across the country, which is costly on its own. Adding an expensive Airbnb on top of that could be a real strain. Also, their family lives nearby, so they can stay there for free. That's a valid alternative that saves money without causing inconvenience to the wedding organizers or friends.\n\nThe friends argue that the author is being selfish, but the author isn't refusing to attend the wedding. They're just opting out of the shared accommodation setup. The author even mentions being willing to chip in a little as a gift, showing they're not entirely opposed to contributing. The key here is that the author isn't making a demand; they're choosing an alternative that works better for their situation. \n\nConsidering their financial hardship and the availability of a free alternative, it's reasonable for them to make this choice. The friends' suggestion that they \"suck it up and pay\" might not take into account the author's current financial reality. Plus, the wedding is about celebrating the couple, not necessarily about everyone's attendance arrangements. The author is not forcing others to pay more or take extra space; they're just finding a way to manage their own costs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a responsible decision based on their circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
