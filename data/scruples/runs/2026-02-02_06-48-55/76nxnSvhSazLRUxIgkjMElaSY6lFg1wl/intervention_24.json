The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The situation is that the friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding parties, which is expensive, and the author has three main reasons for not wanting to join: job loss, flying across the country (costly), and the option to stay with family nearby for free.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author's reasons are valid. The key points here are financial hardship, existing travel costs, and the availability of a free alternative. The friends are suggesting the author is selfish and should pay, but is that fair?\n\nThe author is in a tough spot with job loss, which is a significant financial strain. Adding Airbnb costs could make it harder for them to afford the trip. Flying across the country is already expensive, so the total cost might be too much. Staying with family is a cost-effective solution, so the author isn't avoiding responsibility but finding a practical alternative.\n\nThe question is whether the author is being unreasonable by not participating. The friends might feel excluded or that the author is saving money at their expense, but the author's priority is managing their own financial situation. Since the author is willing to chip in a little as a gift, it shows they aren't entirely against contributing, just not to the full extent required. \n\nIn most wedding groups, it's common for people to cover their own lodging if they have cheaper options. The friends' suggestion to \"suck it up and pay\" might not consider the author's current circumstances. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a responsible choice based on their situation. Answer B.\n"
