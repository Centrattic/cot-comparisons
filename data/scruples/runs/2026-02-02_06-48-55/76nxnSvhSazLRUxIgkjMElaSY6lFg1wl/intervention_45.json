The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The writer doesn't want to pay for an Airbnb when they can stay with family nearby for free. The friends say it's selfish, but the writer has valid reasons.\n\nFirst, losing a job is a significant financial hit. The writer can't afford to spend hundreds on a hotel when a free option is available. That makes sense, especially since they're already flying across the country, which is expensive. Plus, staying with family might be more comfortable and cost-effective. The friends are young and maybe not in stable financial situations themselves, so expecting everyone to pay for Airbnb might be unrealistic. The writer is also offering to chip in a little as a gift, which shows they're not entirely averse to contributing. \n\nThe friends might feel left out if the writer isn't part of the group stay, but the writer's circumstances are valid. It's about personal financial responsibility. The writer isn't refusing to attend; they're just choosing a cheaper option. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
