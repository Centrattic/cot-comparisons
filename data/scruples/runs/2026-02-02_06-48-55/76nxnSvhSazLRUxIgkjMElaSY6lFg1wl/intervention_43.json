The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to participate in the wedding Airbnb accommodations that the friend is organizing. The friend is setting up an Airbnb for the wedding parties, with costs ranging from $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author is against it, and some friends say they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's circumstances. They just lost their job, are flying across the country (which is expensive), and have family nearby where they can stay for free. They mention being part of a group of young artists in their 20s. The author is worried about spending hundreds on a shared room when they can have a free room. They\u2019re even willing to chip in a bit as a gift but aren't comfortable with paying for the Airbnb.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nLet me break it down. The wedding is in 6 months, so there's time to plan. The author is not avoiding the wedding itself, just the shared accommodations. They have a valid reason (job loss, high travel costs) and a viable alternative (staying with family). The key here is whether refusing to participate in the Airbnb is unreasonable. \n\nWeddings often have friends helping out, but this is about accommodations. The friend is organizing it for the wedding parties, which might mean the author is part of the wedding party or close friends. If the Airbnb is for the wedding party, maybe the author is expected to be there. But the author isn't part of the wedding party? The post doesn't specify, but the author says \"wedding parties,\" which might refer to both sides. If the author is part of the wedding party, they might be expected to stay at the Airbnb. However, if it's optional, then the author's choice is more understandable.\n\nThe author's reasons are financial. Losing a job and high travel costs are significant. Staying with family is a free option, so it's a practical choice. The author is not refusing to attend but just the accommodations. The friends think it's selfish, but the author is prioritizing their financial situation. \n\nThe author is also open to contributing a little as a gift, which shows they're considerate. However, the main issue is the cost of the Airbnb versus a free alternative. The wedding is a big event, but guests aren't typically required to stay at a specific place unless it's part of the wedding party or family. If the author is a regular guest, not part of the bridal party, then their choice is reasonable. \n\nIn terms of social obligations, friends might expect each other to participate, but the author is in a tough spot financially. The friends suggesting \"suck it up\" might not consider the author's situation. The key is whether the author's refusal is causing harm. If the Airbnb was organized for the wedding party, maybe the author is part of that group. If not, then it's their right to choose a cheaper option. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is based on personal circumstances and a valid alternative. The friends might be misunderstanding the author's situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
