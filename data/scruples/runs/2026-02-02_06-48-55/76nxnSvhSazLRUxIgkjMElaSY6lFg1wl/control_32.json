The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend organizing a wedding Airbnb and the author not wanting to be included in the accommodations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They lost their job, are flying across the country, and can stay with family nearby for free. Their friends think they're being selfish. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author's circumstances are significant. Losing a job is a major financial hit, so budgeting is probably tight. Flying across the country adds to the expense, making the total cost even higher. The alternative is staying with family for free, which is a valid and cost-effective option. The friends are mostly young artists, which might mean they're also on limited budgets.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is being selfish by not participating in the Airbnb. The friends argue they should \"suck it up and pay.\" But the author is in a tough spot financially. They\u2019re not refusing to contribute entirely\u2014they\u2019re open to chipping in a bit as a gift if it helps. That shows they want to support the wedding but can't afford the full Airbnb cost.\n\nWeddings often have various expenses, and while attending is a gift, the cost shouldn't be so high that it strains someone's finances. The author is making a rational choice to save money by staying with family, which is a common and practical solution. The friends might not realize how severe the author's financial situation is. \n\nIs the author being selfish? It doesn't seem like it. They\u2019re prioritizing their financial stability during a difficult time. The friends' suggestion that they should pay regardless might not consider the author's circumstances. The author isn't avoiding the event but is finding a way to participate without incurring unnecessary debt. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they\u2019re acting in their best interest given their current situation, and their willingness to contribute a little shows they still want to support the event.\n"
