The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to stay in the shared Airbnb the friend is organizing.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend is setting up an Airbnb for the wedding parties, costing $200-500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to be part of this, mainly because they lost their job, are flying across the country, and can stay with family nearby for free. Some friends think they're being selfish and should pay anyway.\n\nThe author's reasons: Financial hardship due to job loss, high travel costs, and a free alternative available. They mention being willing to chip in a bit as a gift if possible.\n\nNow, considering if they're in the wrong. The key factors here are financial constraints and personal circumstances. The author is facing significant financial challenges, which is a legitimate reason to opt out of an expensive shared accommodation. They are already making a big sacrifice by flying across the country, which is costly. Staying with family is a reasonable and cost-effective solution, and it's not like they're refusing to contribute entirely\u2014they're open to giving a gift to help out.\n\nFriends' perspective is that they might feel it's expected to participate, but the author's situation is valid. It's not about being selfish but about managing personal finances during a tough time. The author isn't forcing others to pay; they're choosing an alternative that works for them. The friend organizing the Airbnb isn't obligated to include everyone, but since they're doing it for the group, some might expect participation. However, the author's reasons are understandable and not inconsiderate. They\u2019re not making a grandiose choice but making a necessary adjustment based on their circumstances.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions are unreasonable or inconsiderate. Here, the author is being honest about their situation and using a free option provided by family, which is a common and acceptable practice. They even offer to contribute a little, showing they care about the event. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
