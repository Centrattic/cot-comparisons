The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not wanting to stay in the wedding Airbnb. The author's reasons are losing their job, flying across the country, and having family nearby. Friends think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, the financial situation: losing a job is a big deal. The Airbnb is $200-500 per person for the weekend. That's a significant expense, especially if they're not working. Their family is nearby, so staying there is free, which makes sense. It's a practical choice to save money when they can.\n\nThey mentioned being willing to chip in a little as a gift. That shows they're not entirely self-centered; they want to contribute but can't afford the full cost. The friends might not realize the author's financial stress. \n\nAlso, considering the group is young artists in their 20s, maybe the Airbnb is more of a social event. But the author's priority is managing their own expenses. It's their choice how to allocate funds, especially in a tough time. They're not refusing to attend the wedding, just choosing a more economical option. \n\nSo, no, they're not in the wrong. It's about personal financial responsibility and making choices that fit their current situation. The friends might not see it that way, but the author isn't obligated to spend money they don't have.\n"
