The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who asked \"Am I the a**hole?\" is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend organizing a wedding Airbnb and the person not wanting to be included.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: they lost their job, flying across the country is expensive, and their family is nearby offering a free stay. They mention considering chipping in a little as a gift. The friends think they're being selfish.\n\nSo, I need to evaluate if declining the Airbnb is selfish. The author has valid financial issues. Losing a job is a big hit, and flying long distances adds to the cost. Staying with family is a free option, which is practical. They're not refusing to contribute entirely, just not wanting to pay for the Airbnb. \n\nWedding expenses can be high, but it's a once-in-a-lifetime event. Friends might expect participation, but the author's circumstances are extenuating. They\u2019re not avoiding the wedding, just choosing a cheaper alternative. The friends might feel left out, but it's the author's choice to manage their finances. \n\nIs there an obligation to attend the Airbnb? Not necessarily. The author is still attending the wedding, which is the main event. The Airbnb is an extra. They\u2019re not causing harm by opting out. Their reasoning seems genuine. \n\nSo the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author has valid financial constraints and a viable alternative. They\u2019re not being selfish if they\u2019re honest about their situation. Friends should understand that everyone has different means.\n"
