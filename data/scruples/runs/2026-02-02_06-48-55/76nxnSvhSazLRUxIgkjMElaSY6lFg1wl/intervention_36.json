The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to join the wedding Airbnb. The author's friends think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, the author lost their job, which adds financial strain. That's a significant point because it affects their ability to spend money. Also, they're flying across the country, which is already expensive. So combining that with a costly Airbnb might be a stretch. \n\nThey mentioned staying with family nearby for free. That's a valid reason to avoid the Airbnb. The friends are young and in their 20s, and the author is willing to chip in a little as a gift. They're not entirely refusing to contribute but just don't want to pay for a shared room when a free alternative is available.\n\nThe friends think they should \"suck it up and pay,\" but the author is making a reasonable choice based on their circumstances. It's not about being selfish but managing their finances during a tough time. The key here is financial responsibility versus social pressure. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding or contribute anything; they just want to avoid unnecessary expenses when a free option exists.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their financial situation, which is understandable. The answer should be B.\n"
