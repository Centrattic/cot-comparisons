The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend is organizing a shared AirBnB for the wedding weekend, which costs between $200-$500 per person. The author doesn't want to participate because they just lost their job, are flying across the country, and can stay with their family nearby for free. Some friends think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's circumstances. Losing a job is a significant financial hit, so they're probably under financial stress. Flying across the country is also expensive, and having family nearby offers a free alternative, which makes sense. The author isn't refusing to go to the wedding, just not wanting to pay for the shared accommodations. They mentioned being willing to chip in a little as a gift, which shows some consideration.\n\nThen, the friends argue that the author should \"suck it up and pay.\" But is that fair? Weddings are usually social events where friends are expected to contribute, but the author has valid reasons. The cost of the AirBnB is per person, and if they can stay with family for free, paying for a shared room that's hundreds of dollars might be unnecessary. It's about personal financial responsibility here. The author isn't avoiding the wedding or other costs; they're just opting out of this specific expense because it doesn't make sense for them.\n\nAlso, the group is mostly young artists in their 20s, which might mean they're not all in stable financial positions. The author's situation is unique because they have a free option, while others might not. It's their choice to manage their money how they see fit, especially given their current job status. The friends might feel left out or think the author isn't contributing as much, but the author isn't obligated to spend money they can't afford. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
