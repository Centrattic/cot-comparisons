The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the friend who's not wanting to stay in the Airbnb is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend's reasons: she just lost her job, which is causing financial strain. She's flying across the country, which is already expensive, and her family is nearby, offering free accommodation. The group is mostly young artists in their early 20s, and she's considering staying with them but is hesitant to pay for the Airbnb when she can get a free room.\n\nThe friends argue she's being selfish. But considering her circumstances, job loss is a significant hit. The cost of the Airbnb is $200-500 per person, which adds up. She's already spending on a flight, so budgeting might be tight. Staying with family is a logical choice, especially if it eases financial pressure. Also, she's open to contributing a little as a gift, showing she's not entirely against helping but within her means.\n\nWeddings often have shared expenses, but it's not mandatory. The host is organizing it for the wedding parties, not guests. If the Airbnb is for the wedding party (like bridesmaids, groomsmen), the friend might not be part of that group. Even if she is, financial hardship is a valid reason. People have different financial situations, and it's reasonable to opt out if it's too costly.\n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's prioritizing her financial situation and using available free options. The friends might not see it, but her reasoning is valid.\n"
