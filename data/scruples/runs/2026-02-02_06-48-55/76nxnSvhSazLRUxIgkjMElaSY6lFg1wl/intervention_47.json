The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't want to join the group AirBnB for the wedding because they can stay with family nearby for free, and they have financial issues. The friends think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They lost their job, which is a serious financial hit. They\u2019re flying across the country, so the flight is already expensive. Their family is close to the wedding venue, so staying with them is an option. The group is mostly young artists, so maybe many of them are also struggling financially. The author is willing to chip in a bit as a gift if that helps, but not pay hundreds for a shared room.\n\nOn the other hand, the friends might feel left out or think the author isn't contributing. Weddings often involve shared costs, and maybe the group expects everyone to participate. But is that expectation reasonable here? The author has a valid reason to save money. It's their choice where to stay. They\u2019re not refusing to attend the wedding or not contributing in other ways. They\u2019re saying they can stay with family for free, which is a practical solution. \n\nMaybe the friends are upset because they think the author is avoiding shared responsibilities, but the key here is that the author isn't actually avoiding anything. They\u2019re using a free option they have. The cost of staying in the AirBnB is out of their control right now. Their financial situation is a real hardship. The author isn't being selfish; they\u2019re making a responsible decision given their circumstances. They\u2019re even open to contributing a little as a gift, which shows they want to be considerate.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons related to their financial situation and existing arrangements. The friends might be misunderstanding the author's situation or expecting more than is reasonable given the author's circumstances.\n"
