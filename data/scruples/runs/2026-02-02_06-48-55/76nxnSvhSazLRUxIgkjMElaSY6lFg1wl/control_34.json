The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to stay in the wedding Airbnb. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, costing $200-500 per person. The author doesn't want to join because they can stay with family nearby for free. Their reasons: they lost their job, flying across the country is expensive, and they can avoid the Airbnb cost. Others think they're being selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here are the financial situation of the author and the availability of a free alternative. The author is in a tough spot financially, which is a valid concern. The friends suggest they should \"suck it up and pay,\" but that might not consider the author's personal circumstances. \n\nWeddings are big events, and while attending is a celebration, the cost can add up. The author is making a choice that's financially responsible for them. They also mention being willing to contribute a little as a gift, showing they still want to support the friend. \n\nThe friends' argument is about peer pressure, but everyone has different financial situations. It's not fair to label someone selfish if they're making a choice based on their own economic reality. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding but is choosing a more affordable option. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
