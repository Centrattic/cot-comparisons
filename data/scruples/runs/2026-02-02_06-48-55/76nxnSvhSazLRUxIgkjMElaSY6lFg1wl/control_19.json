The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The author is declining to participate in a group AirBnB for the wedding because they can stay with family for free, they just lost their job, and flying across the country is already expensive. Their friends are saying they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has valid personal reasons: financial hardship, existing arrangements, and wanting to avoid unnecessary expenses. Staying with family is a practical solution and reduces costs. The friends are suggesting the author should pay for the AirBnB, but the author is concerned about the expense. The friends might feel left out or see it as a group activity, but the author isn't obligated to join unless they want to.\n\nFinancial situation is a big factor here. Losing a job is a significant hardship, and the author is prioritizing their resources. The author is also willing to contribute a little as a gift, showing they're not entirely against helping. The friends' perspective is about social inclusion, but the author's right to make their own choices based on circumstances is important.\n\nIn these situations, it's usually not selfish to make personal financial decisions, especially when there's an alternative that doesn't inconvenience others. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding, just choosing a more economical option. The friends might need to understand that everyone has different financial realities. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
