The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person's friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party. The cost is $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to be part of this setup. Their reasons are: they just lost their job (so financial issues), they're flying across the country (which is expensive), and their family lives nearby so they can stay for free. Their friends think they're being selfish and should pay. The author is considering chipping in a little as a gift but is worried about spending hundreds to share a room when they can get a free room.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The author has valid financial constraints. Losing a job is a significant event, and it's reasonable to be cautious with expenses. The wedding is already involving a major cost of flying across the country. The author's family is nearby, so using that as accommodation makes sense both financially and practically. \n\nThe friends seem to think the author should just pay, but they aren't considering the author's current financial stress. It's not uncommon for people to have different situations. The author isn't refusing to contribute entirely; they're open to giving something as a gift, which shows they aren't being completely selfish. \n\nWedding costs can add up, and guests often have varying budgets and circumstances. The Airbnb is a shared accommodation arranged by the friend, but the author isn't obligated to join if it's not feasible for them. There's no mention of the author being rude or refusing to help altogether. They're prioritizing their financial well-being, which is understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their reasons are legitimate. The answer should be B.\n"
