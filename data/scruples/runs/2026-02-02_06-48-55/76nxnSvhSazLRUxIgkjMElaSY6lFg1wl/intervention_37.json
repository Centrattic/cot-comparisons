      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to participate in a wedding Airbnb that the friend is organizing. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the friend is setting up an Airbnb for the wedding party's weekend stay, costing $200-$500 per person. The author doesn't want to be part of this, and some friends think they're being selfish. The author's reasons are: 1) recently lost their job, which is a financial hit, 2) flying across the country, which is expensive, and 3) family is nearby and they can stay for free. The author mentions they want to stay with friends and would chip in a little as a gift but can't afford the Airbnb.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. Let's consider the context. The author has valid financial constraints. Losing a job is a significant hardship. The wedding is a big event, but guests might have varying financial situations. The author is choosing to stay with family, which is a free option, rather than spending money when they can't afford it. Is it selfish to not participate in a group expense when you can't afford it?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friends feel that since they're all staying together, the author should contribute to the Airbnb. But the author's situation is unique. They have a free alternative. The key points here are the financial hardship and the availability of an alternative. Also, the author is willing to chip in a little as a gift, showing they want to support the wedding but can't afford the full cost. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for being inconsiderate, but if there's a legitimate reason and the person is honest about their situation, they're usually not the asshole. The author is not forcing others to pay more; they just can't afford their own share. The friends' suggestion that they \"suck it up\" might be dismissive of the author's real financial struggles. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They have valid reasons and are making a choice based on their circumstances without being inconsiderate to others.\n"
