The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be part of the wedding accommodations. The situation is that the author's friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, which is going to be expensive. The author has their own reasons for not joining, like losing their job, flying across the country, and having family nearby. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is facing financial difficulties after losing a job, which is a significant hardship. They're already spending a lot on the flight, and staying with family is a free option. The Airbnb is expensive, ranging from $200 to $500 per person. The author is being called selfish for not joining, but they argue that they can't afford it and have a free alternative.\n\nFriends think they should just pay, but maybe they're not considering the author's current situation. The key here is whether the author is obligated to pay for the Airbnb. Weddings often have various expenses, but it's not a universal rule that everyone must stay at the arranged accommodations. The author is making a choice based on their financial constraints, which is valid.\n\nAlso, the group is mostly young artists in their early 20s, which might mean many have financial challenges. The author is willing to chip in a little as a gift, showing they're not entirely against contributing. They just can't afford the full Airbnb cost. The main issue is the financial burden versus the expectation to participate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have legitimate reasons to decline. The friends might be wrong to label them as selfish without understanding their situation. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they're just choosing a more affordable option. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
