The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1.

My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to be included in the wedding Airbnb arrangements.\n\nFirst, the friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding parties. The cost ranges from $200 to $500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to be part of this setup and is being called selfish by some friends. The reasons given are: recently unemployed, flying across the country (which is expensive), and family nearby where they can stay free. The author is in their early 20s, part of a group of young artists, and would even chip in a little if possible, but can't afford the Airbnb.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break down the factors. The main point is about the obligation to participate in shared accommodations. The author's reasons are financial hardship due to unemployment, the cost of the flight, and having a free alternative. The friends think they should \"suck it up and pay,\" implying some social pressure to contribute or participate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often feel pressured to conform even when they have valid personal reasons. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they just don't want to pay for a shared accommodation they can avoid. They also offer to contribute a little as a gift, showing they're not completely unwilling to help. Their situation is legitimate\u2014job loss is a significant financial hit, and flying across the country is already expensive. Staying with family is a practical solution.\n\nFriends calling them selfish might be missing the financial strain. The author isn't choosing to be difficult but is making a choice based on their circumstances. It's not about the accommodation itself but the cost. Since they have a free option, opting out of the Airbnb setup isn't being inconsiderate. The key here is that the author is managing their own finances responsibly given their situation, and the friends might be misunderstanding the severity of their unemployment's impact.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They are making a choice that's in their best interest given their current circumstances without imposing on others beyond what they can offer. So the answer should be B.\n"
