The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not wanting to participate in the wedding Airbnb. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding parties, costing $200-$500 per person. The author doesn't want to join and has three reasons: they lost their job, flying across the country is expensive, and their family is nearby. The friends think they're being selfish.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether refusing to pay for the Airbnb is selfish. Let's consider the author's circumstances. Losing a job is a valid financial hardship. Flying is a big expense, and staying with family is a free option. The author isn't refusing to help out because they're cheap, but because they can't afford it right now. Also, they mentioned they might chip in a little as a gift, showing they still want to contribute.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the wedding is the host's event. The author is not obligated to pay for accommodations unless they agreed beforehand. The friends might feel left out if they're all staying together, but the author's situation is different. The friends suggesting it's selfish might not be considering the financial strain.\n\nAdditionally, the group is young artists, likely with variable incomes. The Airbnb costs are high for the weekend. The author's choice to stay with family is practical. They're not avoiding the event but choosing a free option. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial situation. The answer should be B.\n"
