The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong for not wanting to stay at the expensive Airbnb. The situation is their friend is organizing accommodations for the wedding party, and the author is being told they're selfish for not participating. The author's reasons are: job loss leading to financial trouble, the cost of flying across the country, and family nearby offering free stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's financial situation is tough right now. Losing a job is a significant hardship, and with the flight already being expensive, adding Airbnb costs could be a burden. Using family's free accommodation seems logical to save money. The friends argue that being part of the Airbnb is expected, but the author is just trying to manage their expenses.\n\nThe wedding is a big event, and friends might expect to share experiences, but everyone's circumstances differ. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they're just opting for a cheaper stay. It's about personal financial management. The author also mentions being willing to chip in a little as a gift, showing they\u2019re not entirely selfish\u2014they\u2019re just prioritizing their needs.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for people to have different budgets and make choices based on their situation. The friends might feel left out if the author isn't part of the Airbnb, but that's not the author's fault. The key point is the author has a valid reason (financial) and a viable alternative (family's place). So, they're not in the wrong for prioritizing their circumstances.\n"
