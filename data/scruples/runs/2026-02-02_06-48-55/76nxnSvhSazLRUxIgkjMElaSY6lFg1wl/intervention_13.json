The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is at fault for not wanting to join the wedding Airbnb. The author lists their reasons: unemployed, flying across the country, and having family nearby. They don't want to pay for shared accommodations when they can stay for free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings can be expensive, and it's common for guests to cover their own lodging. The friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, which might be a group effort or something she's handling. The author's refusal could be seen as not wanting to contribute, but their circumstances are valid. Losing a job is a major financial hit, and flying long distances adds to the cost. Staying with family is a practical solution and saves money.\n\nThe friends think the author is being selfish, but the author isn't refusing to attend or contribute entirely. They're just choosing a cheaper option that works for them. The key points here are financial hardship and available alternatives. The author isn't avoiding the wedding; they're finding a way to attend within their means. Since they're still going and maybe even willing to chip in a little as a gift, they're not entirely avoiding the costs. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, it's usually expected to cover your own expenses unless the hosts specify otherwise. The author isn't being asked to pay for others; they're just opting out of a shared expense when they can get a free alternative. Their situation is understandable, especially in a group of young artists who might be budget-conscious. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible financial decision given their circumstances. The friends might not understand, but the author isn't obligated to pay for something they can avoid. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
