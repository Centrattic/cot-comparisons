The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be in the wedding accommodations. The situation is that the friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, which is expensive. The author doesn't want to participate because they lost their job, are flying across the country, and can stay with family nearby for free. Friends say they're being selfish, but the author is worried about the cost.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author's reasons are financial hardship, flying a long distance, and having a free option. The friends are artists in their 20s, which might mean they have limited resources. The author is considering chipping in a bit as a gift, showing they're not entirely against contributing but want to avoid the Airbnb cost.\n\nWedding expenses can be a sensitive topic. Typically, guests might expect to cover their own hotel costs, but when the host organizes a group booking, there's an unspoken expectation to join. However, the author has a valid reason not to participate because they have an alternative. The cost of the Airbnb is significant, $200-500 per person for the weekend, which is a lot for someone who's unemployed and already spending on a flight.\n\nThe friends might feel the author is avoiding contribution, but if they can stay with family, it's a practical choice. The author isn't refusing to help entirely\u2014offering to chip in as a gift shows they still want to support the wedding. So, they're not being selfish but making a responsible decision given their circumstances.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while joining the group Airbnb is common, it's not a strict rule. The author is within their right to choose the cheaper, free option. The friends might be misunderstanding the situation, thinking it's just about not wanting to pay, but the author's reasons are legitimate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
