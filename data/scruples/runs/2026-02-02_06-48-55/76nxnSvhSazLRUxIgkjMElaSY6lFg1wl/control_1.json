The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend's wedding where they're organizing AirBnBs for the wedding parties, and the author doesn't want to be included in those accommodations. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They mention losing a job, which is causing financial strain. They're flying across the country, which is already expensive, and their family is nearby, so they can stay there for free. They also say they're willing to chip in a little as a gift.\n\nThe friends think they're being selfish for not paying. But the key here is whether the author is obligated to participate. Weddings often have shared expenses, but it's not usually mandatory unless specified. The author isn't declining to attend the wedding itself but just the accommodation arrangement. They have a valid reason to avoid the extra cost, especially with their current financial situation. \n\nAlso, they're offering to contribute a little, which shows they're trying to be considerate. The friends might feel left out if the author isn't there, but the author isn't being rude. They have a legitimate alternative that doesn't cost extra. It's about personal financial hardship and practicality, not selfishness. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons and are trying to balance their finances. The friends might not see it that way, but the author isn't being selfish without cause. The answer should be B.\n"
