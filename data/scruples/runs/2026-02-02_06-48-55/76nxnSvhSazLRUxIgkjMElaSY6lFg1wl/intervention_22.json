The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend organizing a wedding Airbnb, and the author doesn't want to participate even though some friends think they're being selfish. The author has three main points: they just lost their job, they're flying across the country (which is expensive), and their family lives nearby, so they can stay for free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments. The author is in a tough financial situation right now. Job loss is a significant stressor, and they're already spending money on airfare. The wedding is a big event, but friends are suggesting they should pay for the Airbnb. The author's reasoning is practical: they can stay for free with their family, so paying for a shared room isn't necessary. They also mention being willing to chip in a little as a gift, which shows some willingness to contribute but within their means.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friends feel that the Airbnb is part of the shared experience. Weddings often have group activities, and staying together might be expected. But the author's circumstances are valid. They're not the only one going to the wedding, and the friends are in their early 20s, possibly with limited incomes too. The cost range is steep\u2014$200-500 per person for the weekend. For someone who lost a job, that's a big hit.\n\nI think the key points are the financial hardship and the availability of a free alternative. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding, just the group accommodation. They're not being uncooperative but are making a choice based on their current situation. The friends might see it as selfish, but the author is being honest about their limits. In AITA situations, honesty and communication are usually appreciated. The author is also offering to contribute a little, which shows they're trying to be considerate. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
