The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to participate in the wedding Airbnb setup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, and the cost ranges from $200 to $500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to be part of this arrangement. Some friends think the author is being selfish and should just pay. The author's reasons are: 1) recently lost their job, 2) flying across the country which is expensive, 3) family lives 15 minutes away, so they can stay for free. The author mentions being part of a group of young artists in their 20s, and they're okay with contributing a little as a gift but not the full cost. They're worried about spending hundreds on a shared room when they can have a free room nearby.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me consider the circumstances. The author is facing financial hardship after losing a job. That's a valid reason to be cautious with spending. The cost of the Airbnb is significant, especially when combined with the flight cost. They have an alternative that's free, which is staying with family. Friends suggest they should \"suck it up,\" but that might not consider their personal financial situation. \n\nThe author isn't refusing to attend the wedding, just choosing a more affordable option. They even mention being willing to contribute a little as a gift, showing they're not entirely opposed to contributing. The friends' criticism might stem from not understanding the author's financial constraints. \n\nIn social situations like weddings, it's common for people to have different budgets and arrangements. The author isn't asking for anything; they have a viable alternative. The main issue is the friends labeling them as selfish, which might be unfair given the circumstances. \n\nI think the author is justified in their decision. They're managing their finances responsibly, especially after job loss. It's their choice how to allocate their resources, and the fact that they can stay with family reduces the burden. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
