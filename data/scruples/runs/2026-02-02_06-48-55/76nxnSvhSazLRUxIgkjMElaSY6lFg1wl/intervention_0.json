The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author doesn't want to participate in the wedding Airbnb and prefers to stay with family nearby for free. The friends think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author lost their job, which adds financial stress. They\u2019re flying across the country, so travel costs are already high. They have a free option with family. The Airbnb is $200-500 per person for the weekend. The friends are mostly young artists, possibly on tight budgets too.\n\nThe author isn't refusing to attend the wedding but is declining a specific accommodation choice. They\u2019re not asking others to cover their costs, just choosing a cheaper option. The friends argue they should \"suck it up,\" but that might not consider the author's financial situation. Also, staying with family isn't imposing on the wedding party; it's their own family nearby.\n\nThe author is willing to contribute a little as a gift, showing they're not entirely against helping. The main issue is financial hardship, which is a valid reason to decline. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their finances, especially with legitimate reasons. The friends might be misunderstanding their situation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
