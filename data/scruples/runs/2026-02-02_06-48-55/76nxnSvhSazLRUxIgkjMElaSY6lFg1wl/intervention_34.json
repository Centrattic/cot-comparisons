The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the friend not wanting to participate in the wedding Airbnb arrangements.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the arguments. The author lost their job, which is causing financial strain. They're flying across the country, which is expensive, and they can stay for free with their family nearby. The friends think they're selfish for not wanting to pay for the Airbnb. \n\nThe key points here are financial hardship and alternatives. The author is in a tough spot with job loss, so their concern about spending money is understandable. They\u2019re already paying for a flight, which is a big expense. Staying with family is a viable and cost-effective solution. The friends suggest they should \"suck it up,\" but that might not consider the author's financial situation. \n\nThe friends organized the Airbnb for the wedding parties, but the author isn't part of the wedding party. Maybe the Airbnb is just for certain people, like the bridal party or those without local accommodations. The author isn't being selfish if they have a free alternative. It's reasonable to prioritize their finances, especially with recent job loss. \n\nAlso, the author mentions being willing to chip in a little as a gift, showing they're not entirely opposed to contributing. The main issue is the cost of staying in the Airbnb when they can stay with family. The friends might not realize the financial pressure here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a responsible choice given their circumstances. The friends might be misunderstanding the situation, thinking it's about wanting to have their own room for comfort, but it's actually about financial necessity. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
