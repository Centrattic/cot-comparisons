The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to join the wedding Airbnb. The writer's reasons are: they're unemployed, flying across the country for the wedding, and can stay with family nearby for free. Others think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, weddings often have shared accommodations for the wedding party, but it's not mandatory. The writer has valid personal circumstances. They lost their job, which adds financial strain. The flight is expensive, so saving on lodging makes sense. Also, staying with family is free and convenient. The friends are young and might not have the same financial pressures, but the writer isn't avoiding the event\u2014they're just choosing a cheaper option. \n\nIs it selfish? Maybe not. People have different financial situations. The writer isn't refusing to attend; they just want to manage costs. Offering to chip in a little as a gift shows consideration. The friends might be expecting everyone to participate in the Airbnb, but the writer has practical reasons to opt out. The key is whether the writer is being inconsiderate. Since they can still attend and are offering some contribution, it seems reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
