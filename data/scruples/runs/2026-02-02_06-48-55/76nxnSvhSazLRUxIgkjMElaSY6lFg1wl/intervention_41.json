The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to stay in the AirBnB the friend organized for the wedding. The friend is setting up accommodations costing $200-500 per person for the wedding weekend. The person doesn't want to be part of it and has some reasons.\n\nFirst, they just lost their job, which is a big financial hit. That's a valid reason to be concerned about expenses. Second, they're flying across the country, which is expensive. Third, their family lives close by, so they can stay there for free. The friends think they're being selfish, but the person says they'd chip in a little as a gift if that helps, but can't afford the full cost.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the friend is organizing this AirBnB, but it's not mandatory unless you want to be part of the wedding party's group activities. The person is choosing not to participate in that setup to save money, using their family's offer instead. They're not declining the wedding invitation; they're just opting out of a specific accommodation choice. \n\nIn terms of social norms, friends might expect participation in shared activities, but when there's a significant financial burden, it's reasonable to opt out if there's an alternative. The person is being honest about their financial situation and isn't refusing to contribute entirely\u2014they\u2019re offering a small gift. It seems like they're managing their own finances responsibly without imposing on others. The friends labeling them as selfish might be missing the financial stress the person is under. So, the answer is B.\n"
