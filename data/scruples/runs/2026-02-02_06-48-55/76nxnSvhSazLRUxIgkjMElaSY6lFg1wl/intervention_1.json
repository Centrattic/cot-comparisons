The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend's wedding where the author is being asked to stay in an Airbnb organized by the friend. The author is declining because they can stay with family nearby for free, have just lost their job, and the trip is already expensive. They're being called selfish by some friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The key factors here are the author's financial situation, the availability of an alternative (staying with family), and the friends' reactions. The author is in a tough spot with job loss, which affects their finances. The wedding is a significant expense for them, including the flight. The Airbnb costs range from $200 to $500 per person, which adds up. The author can stay with family for free, so they're not avoiding responsibility but using a more economical option.\n\nThe friends argue that the author should pay their share, but the author is worried about the cost. It's important to note that the author isn't refusing to contribute entirely\u2014they mention being willing to chip in a little as a gift. That shows some intention to participate, just not at the same level as others. Also, the author isn't being excluded; they're choosing to opt out of the Airbnb setup.\n\nIn terms of social norms, guests usually cover their own accommodation costs. The fact that the author can stay with family for free means they're not imposing on the wedding budget. The friends' criticism might stem from not understanding the author's financial strain. The author's reasons seem valid and understandable, especially given their recent job loss and the expense of traveling across the country. They\u2019re not being inconsiderate by choosing a cheaper option when a free one is available.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They are making a responsible financial decision based on their circumstances. The friends might need to be more empathetic to the author's situation. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
