The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about a friend organizing a shared Airbnb for the wedding party, but the poster doesn't want to be included in the accommodations.\n\nFirst, the key points from the post: The poster lost their job, making financial strain a big issue. They're flying across the country, which is already expensive. Their family lives close to the wedding venue, so they can stay for free. The friends suggest they're being selfish by not joining the Airbnb, which ranges from $200-500 per person.\n\nThe group is mostly young artists in their early 20s, so maybe they have limited budgets. The poster is willing to chip in a little as a gift but can't afford the Airbnb. They\u2019re worried about sharing a room when they have a free option.\n\nConsidering the circumstances, the poster has valid reasons. Financial hardship after losing a job is a significant factor. The cost of flying across the country is already a major expense. Using family accommodation is a practical solution. The friends might not realize the financial impact on the poster. Being in the wrong would require the poster to have acted selfishly without justification, but here, they have legitimate constraints. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
