The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend organizing a group Airbnb for a wedding, and the author doesn't want to be part of it. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: they just lost their job, which is a financial hit. They're flying across the country, which is expensive, and their family is nearby, offering free accommodation. The friends' group is mostly young artists, and the author is worried about spending hundreds for a shared room when they could have a free room.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether refusing to participate in the Airbnb is selfish. The friends think they should pay, but the author has valid financial constraints. The author isn't refusing to participate entirely; they're just opting for a cheaper alternative. Also, they mention being willing to chip in a little as a gift, showing they\u2019re not entirely against contributing.\n\nFinancial situations vary. The author's job loss is a significant factor. It's reasonable to prioritize spending on travel when you're already incurring costs. Plus, using family accommodation is practical and cost-effective. The friends might not be in the same financial boat, but that doesn't make the author wrong for making a choice that suits their circumstances.\n\nSocial obligations can be tricky, but forcing someone to spend beyond their means isn't fair. The author isn't avoiding the wedding; they\u2019re just choosing a more affordable option. The friends' suggestion that they should \"suck it up\" might not consider the author's current hardships.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't being selfish. They're making a responsible financial decision given their situation. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
