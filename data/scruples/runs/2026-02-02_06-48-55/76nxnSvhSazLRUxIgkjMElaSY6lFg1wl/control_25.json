      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to stay in the AirBnB the friend organized for the wedding party. Let's break down the details.\n\nThe friend is getting married in six months and has arranged AirBnBs costing $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to be part of this setup. Some friends think the author is being selfish and should just pay. The author's reasons are: 1. Recently lost a job, leading to financial strain. 2. Already incurred the expense of flying across the country. 3. Family lives 15 minutes away, so they can stay for free. The author is open to chipping in a little as a gift but is worried about spending hundreds on a shared room when a free option is available.\n\nFirst, financial situation: Losing a job is a significant hardship. The author's concern about spending extra when they're already dealing with job loss seems valid. Friends suggesting they \"suck it up\" might not consider their current financial state.\n\nSecond, travel costs: Flying across the country is expensive. Adding AirBnB costs could make the trip financially burdensome, especially if the author is already managing expenses from the flight.\n\nThird, free accommodation option: The author's family is nearby, which is a practical solution. The question is whether it's acceptable to opt out of the group arrangement for a free alternative. The friends seem to think the author should participate, but the author is making a reasonable choice based on their circumstances.\n\nThe friends are mostly young artists in their 20s, which might mean many are also dealing with financial constraints. The author isn't refusing to help entirely\u2014they mentioned being willing to contribute a little as a gift. This shows a willingness to participate in a way that's feasible for them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It doesn't seem like it. They're making a choice that works for their situation without being disrespectful. The friend organizing the wedding is making an arrangement, but guests have the autonomy to choose how they handle their own accommodations, especially when viable alternatives exist. The friends calling them selfish might be projecting their own expectations without considering the author's financial reality.\n\nSo, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
