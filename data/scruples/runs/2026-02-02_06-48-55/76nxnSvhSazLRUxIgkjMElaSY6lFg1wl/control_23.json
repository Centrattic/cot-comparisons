The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1.

My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to join the wedding Airbnb. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe person's friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party over the weekend, with costs ranging from $200 to $500 per person. The poster doesn't want to participate, and some friends think they're being selfish. The reasons given are:\n\n1. Recently lost their job, which is a significant financial hit.\n2. Already incurred the expense of flying across the country.\n3. Family lives 15 minutes away, so they can stay for free.\n\nThe group is mostly young artists in their early 20s. The poster mentions they'd like to stay with friends but are worried about spending hundreds on a shared room when a free option is available. They\u2019re even open to chipping in a little as a gift if it helps.\n\nFirst, financial hardship is a valid concern. Losing a job is a major life event, adding to existing expenses like a flight. The cost of the Airbnb could be prohibitive, especially if they're already spending a lot to attend. The ability to stay with family is a practical solution that avoids unnecessary costs. It's reasonable for them to choose the free option, especially when they can still attend the wedding and contribute in other ways, like maybe giving a monetary gift.\n\nThe friends suggesting they should \"suck it up\" might be overlooking the financial strain. Weddings can be expensive, and guests often have different budgets. The poster isn't refusing to attend the wedding itself, just the shared accommodation. They\u2019re not avoiding participation entirely; they're making a choice based on their circumstances. It's their right to manage their finances as they see fit, especially during tough times.\n\nThe group is young and perhaps not all in stable financial positions. Expecting everyone to pay for premium accommodations might be unrealistic. The key here is that the poster isn't being inconsiderate by avoiding the event altogether but is seeking a more economical solution that works for them. The fact that they\u2019re open to contributing a gift shows their willingness to support the couple in some way, which is commendable.\n\nIn conclusion, the poster isn't in the wrong. Their decision is financially prudent and based on personal circumstances. They\u2019re not being selfish by choosing a free option when available, especially with the added expense of travel and job loss. The friends' judgment doesn't account for the financial realities the poster is facing.\n"
