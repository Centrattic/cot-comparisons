The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for not wanting to stay in the wedding Airbnb.\n\nSo the situation is: the friend organized an Airbnb for the wedding party, which is expensive. The author doesn't want to be part of it because they lost their job, are flying across the country, and can stay with their family nearby for free. Some friends think they're being selfish. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author has valid reasons: job loss, travel costs, and a free alternative. The friends suggest they should just pay. But the author is concerned about spending hundreds on a shared room when they can have a free room. \n\nFrom a financial standpoint, losing a job is a significant hardship. The author is already spending on a flight, which is expensive. Adding Airbnb costs could be a burden. Also, staying with family is a practical solution. It's not like they're avoiding the event or not contributing; they're just choosing a cheaper option. \n\nThe friends might feel left out, but the author isn't refusing to attend. They\u2019re just not participating in the Airbnb. It's their choice how to manage their expenses, especially under their current circumstances. The author even mentions being willing to chip in a little as a gift, showing they\u2019re not entirely unwilling to contribute. \n\nIn terms of social obligations, weddings are big events, but guests aren't required to stay in the arranged accommodations unless specified. The author isn't causing harm; they're saving money and using a free option. The friends' criticism seems harsh unless the wedding party had a formal requirement to stay in the Airbnb. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re managing their finances during a tough time and using a free alternative. The friends might not understand the financial strain, but the author's decision is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
