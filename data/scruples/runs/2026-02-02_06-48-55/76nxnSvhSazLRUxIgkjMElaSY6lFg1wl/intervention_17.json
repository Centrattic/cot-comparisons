The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The situation is that the friend is organizing an AirBnb for the wedding party, costing $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to participate, and some friends think they're being selfish.\n\nThe author's reasons are: 1) Lost their job, 2) Flying across the country, which is expensive, 3) Family is nearby and can stay with them for free. They mention they're young artists in their early 20s and would be willing to chip in a little as a gift if it helps, but don't want to pay hundreds for a shared room when they can get a free room nearby.\n\nSo, first, I need to evaluate if the author is wrong. The key points here are their financial situation and the alternatives available. Losing a job is a significant financial hit, so spending extra on accommodations might be tough. The flight is already expensive, so adding AirBnb costs could be a burden. Also, staying with family is free, which is a valid reason not to pay for the AirBnb. They also mention being willing to contribute a bit as a gift, which shows they aren't entirely against helping, just not in this specific way.\n\nThe friends think they're selfish, but maybe they don't consider the author's financial constraints. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of social obligations, attending a wedding is expected, but how much you spend on it is personal. If the wedding is in another country, the flight is a big expense. The author is trying to save money by staying with family, which is a reasonable choice. They aren't refusing to contribute entirely, just not in the way the friend organized. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons related to job loss and existing expenses, and the alternative is free. The friends might not understand their financial situation, but the author isn't being selfish if they have a legitimate reason to save money. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
