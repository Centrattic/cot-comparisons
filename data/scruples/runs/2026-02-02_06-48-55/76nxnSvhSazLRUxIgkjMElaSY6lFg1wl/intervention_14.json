The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend organizing a shared Airbnb for the wedding party, and the writer doesn't want to participate because of financial reasons.\n\nFirst, let's look at the writer's circumstances. They lost their job, which is a significant financial hit. They're flying across the country, which is expensive, and their family lives nearby, offering a free stay. Their friends suggest they're being selfish for not joining the Airbnb setup. The writer is willing to chip in a little as a gift but is hesitant about paying hundreds for a shared room when they can stay for free.\n\nNow, considering the friends' perspective: maybe they see it as a group activity, expecting everyone to contribute equally or take part in the planned accommodations. They might feel that the writer is avoiding shared responsibilities or not getting involved in the group plans. However, the writer has a valid financial situation. Losing a job is a major life event, and they are already spending a lot on travel. Using family's free accommodation is practical.\n\nThe key points here are the writer's financial hardship and the availability of a free alternative. If the Airbnb is meant for the wedding party, perhaps the writer isn't part of the core group that needs to stay there, but the friends might have assumed everyone should. However, the writer isn't refusing to attend the wedding or contribute entirely\u2014they\u2019re just opting out of the shared accommodations. They\u2019re even open to giving a gift contribution, which shows they\u2019re not completely uncooperative.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers personal circumstances and intentions. The writer isn't being inconsiderate; they\u2019re making a practical decision based on their current situation. The friends might not be considering the writer's financial struggles. The writer isn't obligated to spend money they can't afford, especially when an alternative exists. So, the answer would likely be that the writer is not in the wrong.\n"
