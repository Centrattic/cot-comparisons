The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The situation is about a friend organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, but the person doesn't want to participate because of their financial situation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the user's circumstances. They lost their job, which adds financial strain. They're flying across the country, which is expensive. Their family is nearby and offers free accommodation. They're part of a group of young artists, probably with limited funds. They mention they'd chip in a little as a gift but not pay for the Airbnb.\n\nThe friends are calling them selfish, but the key points are their financial hardships. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding but is choosing a free option. They\u2019re not avoiding the event, just opting out of a costly arrangement. The friends might feel it's about contributing, but the author's situation is real. They\u2019re not being inconsiderate; they\u2019re managing their own resources. It's about personal financial responsibility, not avoiding the wedding. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
