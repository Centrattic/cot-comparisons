The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for not wanting to stay in the wedding Airbnb. Let me look at the details.\n\nThe friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding parties, costing $200-$500 per person. The author doesn't want to join and is being called selfish. Their reasons: lost job, flying across the country (expensive), and family nearby offering free stay. They mention they're in their early 20s, part of a group of young artists, and even consider chipping in a little as a gift.\n\nFirst, the main point is about whether refusing to participate is selfish. The author has valid financial constraints. Losing a job is a significant issue. The cost of the Airbnb is high, especially when they can stay with family for free. The friends suggest they should \"suck it up,\" but that's ignoring the author's personal circumstances.\n\nAlso, the author isn't refusing to contribute entirely; they're open to giving a little as a gift. That shows they care but can't afford the Airbnb. The friends might not realize the financial pressure here. Being expected to pay for a shared room when a free alternative exists seems unfair. The author isn't avoiding the wedding or not wanting to be part of the group\u2014they're making a personal choice to manage their finances during a tough time.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. Their situation is legitimate, and the friends' judgment might stem from not understanding their financial hardship. So the answer should be B.\n"
