The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, costing $200-$500 per person. The author doesn't want to be part of this setup. Their reasons are: they just lost their job, they're flying across the country (which is expensive), and their family is 15 minutes away where they can stay for free. The friends think they're being selfish.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong to decline the Airbnb and choose a free option. Let's consider the factors. Financial hardship is a big one. Losing a job recently would make it tough to spend extra. Also, flying across the country is a significant expense, so saving on accommodations makes sense. They can stay with family for free, which is a valid and practical choice. \n\nThe author even mentions being willing to chip in a little as a gift, which shows they're not entirely unwilling to contribute. The friends argue that they should \"suck it up,\" but that might ignore the author's specific circumstances. Weddings can be expensive, and people often have different financial situations. It's reasonable for someone to prioritize their budget, especially when there's a free alternative available.\n\nI should also consider cultural or social expectations. In some cases, attending a wedding and contributing to shared costs might be expected, but if there's a legitimate reason to opt out (like financial hardship), then it's understandable. The author isn't avoiding the event entirely; they're just choosing a more affordable option.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision is a practical one given their situation. They aren't inconsiderate since they're open to contributing a bit as a gift. Therefore, they're not in the wrong.\n"
