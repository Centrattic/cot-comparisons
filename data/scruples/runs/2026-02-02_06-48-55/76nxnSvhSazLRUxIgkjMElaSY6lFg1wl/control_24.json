The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to participate in the wedding Airbnb that the friend is organizing. The author has three main reasons: job loss, expensive travel, and family nearby offering free accommodation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author is being selfish. The friend is organizing the Airbnb for the wedding parties, which the author isn't part of. The author is flying across the country, which is costly, but has a free option with family. The friends think they should just pay, but the author can't afford it due to losing a job. \n\nThe key points here are financial constraints and availability of an alternative. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding but is choosing a cheaper option. They're also open to chipping in a little as a gift, showing they're not entirely against contributing. \n\nWeddings can be expensive, and guests often have different financial situations. The author's circumstances are valid. The friend is organizing the Airbnb for the wedding parties, so maybe the author isn't part of the wedding party and thus not expected to stay there. The friends' suggestion that the author should \"suck it up\" might be insensitive to their current hardship. \n\nIn terms of social norms, guests aren't obligated to stay in the provided accommodations unless specified. The author is making a practical choice to save money, which is understandable. The answer likely hinges on whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they have a valid alternative and their reasons are legitimate, they aren't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
