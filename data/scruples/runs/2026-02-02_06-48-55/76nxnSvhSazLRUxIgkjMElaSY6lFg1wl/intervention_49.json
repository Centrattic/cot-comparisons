The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1.

My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The story is that the friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding parties, which would cost between $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to participate and is being told by friends that they're selfish. Their reasons are losing their job, flying cross-country, and staying with family nearby for free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for and against. On one hand, the author is in a tough financial situation with job loss, which is a significant factor. They're also flying a long distance, which is expensive, and they can stay with family, so they might not need to pay for the Airbnb. It's reasonable for someone to prioritize their finances, especially when they're facing job loss. Also, the friends involved are young and might not all have stable incomes, so expecting them to cover the cost of an Airbnb could be unrealistic.\n\nOn the other hand, some friends think the author is being selfish. The idea of contributing to shared accommodations might be seen as a way to share the cost and bond with friends. However, the author is willing to chip in a little as a gift, which shows they're not entirely unwilling to help. The key here is the author's personal circumstances versus the social expectation to participate. \n\nFinancial hardship is a valid reason to decline additional expenses. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding or contribute in other ways; they're just opting out of the Airbnb because they can't afford it. The fact that they can stay with family for free is a legitimate reason not to pay for a shared room. The friends' suggestion that they \"suck it up\" might not consider the author's current financial stress. \n\nAnother angle is that weddings often involve significant expenses, and participants might expect others to share in the costs. However, the Airbnb is organized by the friend, and it's not explicitly stated as a mandatory expense. If it's optional, then the author's choice to decline isn't wrong. The author is also being considerate by mentioning they might contribute a bit as a gift, which helps ease the situation.\n\nSo weighing these factors, the author's decision is based on personal financial constraints and viable alternatives. They aren't being inconsiderate but are managing their own situation. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
