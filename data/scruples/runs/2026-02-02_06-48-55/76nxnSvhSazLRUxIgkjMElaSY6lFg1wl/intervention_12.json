The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The scenario is that the friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding parties, which costs between $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to be part of this setup. Their reasons are: 1. They just lost their job, which is causing financial strain. 2. They're flying across the country, which is already expensive. 3. Their family lives 15 minutes away, so they can stay there for free. They mention that their friends, mostly young artists in their 20s, think they're being selfish and should just pay. The author is considering chipping in a little as a gift but is hesitant to spend a lot.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know my opinion. The answer should be A or B. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author is facing financial difficulties after losing their job. They're already incurring a significant expense by flying across the country. They have a free alternative (staying with family) that's convenient. The friends argue that sharing the Airbnb is the norm and that the author should contribute. However, the key points here are the author's valid financial constraints and the availability of an alternative. \n\nWedding costs can be a sensitive topic. Friends might feel that contributing to shared expenses is part of being part of the wedding party or attending. However, the author's circumstances are specific: job loss, high travel costs, and a free alternative. The Airbnb's price range is quite high, $200-$500 per person, which is a lot, especially when you can stay with family for free. \n\nThe author is not refusing to attend the wedding; they just want to avoid the additional expense by using their existing resources. The friends' suggestion that they're being selfish might be because they see it as a social expectation to participate in shared accommodations, but financial reality varies. \n\nI need to consider cultural or social norms. In some cases, attending a wedding might involve contributing to shared expenses, but if someone has a legitimate reason and an alternative, it's not unreasonable. The author's willingness to chip in a little as a gift shows they're not completely unwilling to help, just within their means. \n\nFinancial stress is a real issue, and it's not fair to label someone selfish for prioritizing their financial situation, especially after a job loss. The fact that they can save money by staying with family is a practical choice. The friends might be in a more stable financial position, hence their perspective. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong. They are making a practical decision based on their current circumstances and have a viable alternative. The friends' judgment as selfish may not be valid here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
