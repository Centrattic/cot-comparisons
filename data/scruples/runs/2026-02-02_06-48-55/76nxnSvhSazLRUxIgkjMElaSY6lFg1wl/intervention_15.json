The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to participate in the wedding accommodations. The author's friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, which is expensive. The author has valid reasons: job loss, expensive travel, and staying with family nearby for free. Friends think the author is selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's financial situation is tough with job loss, so spending $200-$500 is a big hit. Flying across the country adds to the cost. The family offer is free, so why pay for an Airbnb when there's a free alternative? The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding, just the Airbnb. They're also willing to chip in a little as a gift, which shows they're not completely against contributing.\n\nThe friends argue that the author should \"suck it up,\" but that might not consider the author's financial struggles. The Airbnb is for the wedding parties, but the author might not be part of the wedding party, just the guests. The friends might be assuming the author should be part of the group setup, but the author's situation is different. \n\nThe key points are the author's financial hardship and the availability of a free alternative. The friends might not realize the stress of job loss and how additional expenses can be burdensome. The author isn't avoiding the wedding itself but is choosing a more economical option. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to have different levels of participation. The author isn't being inconsiderate by not joining the group Airbnb; they're making a choice based on their circumstances. The fact that they're willing to give a gift shows they still want to contribute. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a practical decision given their situation. The friends' judgment might stem from not fully understanding the author's financial state. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
