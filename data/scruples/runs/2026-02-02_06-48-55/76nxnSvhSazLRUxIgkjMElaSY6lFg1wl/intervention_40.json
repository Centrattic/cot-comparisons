The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The situation is that the friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding parties, with costs between $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to be part of this setup. Their reasons are: just lost their job, flying across the country (which is expensive), and their family is 15 minutes away, so they can stay for free.\n\nThe friends are suggesting the author is being selfish and should just pay. The author is considering chipping in a little as a gift but is worried about the cost. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the financial situation, the availability of a free alternative, and the friends' perspective.\n\nThe author's job loss is a significant financial hit. Flying across the country is already expensive, so adding Airbnb costs might be a strain. The family offer is a free, convenient option. The friends might see the Airbnb as a bonding experience or part of the wedding party's tradition, hence their suggestion that the author is being selfish.\n\nHowever, the author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they just don't want to pay for a shared accommodation when a free alternative exists. They're also open to contributing a little. This seems reasonable. The friends might not be considering the author's financial hardship. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, being in the wrong often involves being rude, inconsiderate, or breaking social norms without a valid reason. Here, the author's reasons are valid. They\u2019re managing their finances post-unemployment. The family option is logical. The friends might be expecting everyone to \"suck it up\" as part of the wedding party, but that's not necessarily the case. The author isn't avoiding the event; they\u2019re just optimizing their expenses. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
