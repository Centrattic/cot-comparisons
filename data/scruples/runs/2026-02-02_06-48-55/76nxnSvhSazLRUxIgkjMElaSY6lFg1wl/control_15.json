The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to participate in the wedding Airbnb accommodations.\n\nFirst, looking at the author's circumstances. They just lost their job, which is a significant financial hit. That's a strong point in their favor because unexpected unemployment can really strain finances. Then, they're flying across the country, which is expensive. So, they're already spending a lot to attend the wedding. The third point is that their family is nearby, so they can stay for free. That's a valid reason not to need the Airbnb.\n\nThe friends think the author is being selfish, but maybe they don't consider the financial stress. The author is willing to contribute a little as a gift, showing they aren't completely unwilling to help. The main issue is the cost versus the free alternative. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they're just choosing a more affordable option. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, friends might expect you to contribute to shared events, but when there's a valid alternative that's cheaper and doesn't cost the host anything, it's reasonable. The host organized the Airbnb for the wedding parties, but if the author can stay elsewhere without costing the host, they aren't being selfish. \n\nAlso, considering their age and profession (young artists in early 20s), financial instability is common. The author's situation is relatable. They're not avoiding the event but using a free option provided by family. The friends' suggestion to \"suck it up\" might not account for the author's current financial struggles. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons and are making a practical choice. The answer should be B.\n"
