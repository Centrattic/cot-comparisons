The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" situation is in the wrong. The author doesn't want to stay in the Airbnb the friend organized for the wedding and plans to stay with family nearby instead. The friends think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author lost their job, which is a significant financial hit. They\u2019re flying across the country, which is expensive. Staying with family is free, so they\u2019re trying to save money. The wedding is in 6 months, so maybe there's time to adjust plans. The group is mostly young artists, possibly with limited funds.\n\nThe friends argue that the author should \"suck it up,\" but the author is clearly in a tough spot. They mentioned being willing to chip in a little as a gift, which shows they\u2019re not completely unwilling to contribute. However, they\u2019re just not comfortable paying for an Airbnb when they can get a free alternative.\n\nWedding parties often have shared accommodations, but it's not mandatory. The author is within their rights to choose a different option. The friends might see this as selfish, but considering the financial circumstances, it's a reasonable decision. The author isn't forcing others to exclude them; they\u2019re making a personal choice to manage their expenses.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re prioritizing their financial situation, especially after job loss, and using available resources (family) to reduce costs. The friends\u2019 judgment might stem from not understanding the author's specific challenges. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
