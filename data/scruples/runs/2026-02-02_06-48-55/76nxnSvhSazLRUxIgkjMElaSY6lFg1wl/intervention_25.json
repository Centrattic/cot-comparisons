The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to participate in the wedding Airbnb.\n\nFirst, let me understand the details. The author's friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding weekend, with costs between $200-$500 per person. The author doesn't want to join and is being called selfish. Their reasons: they just lost their job, flying across the country is expensive, and their family is nearby where they can stay for free. They mention they're part of a group of young artists in their 20s and are willing to chip in a little as a gift but not pay for shared accommodation.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has valid financial constraints. Losing a job is a significant event, and they might be struggling. They're already spending on a flight, which adds to their expenses. Staying with family is a free option, so it makes sense to take that to save money. The fact that they're willing to contribute a little as a gift shows they're not entirely uncooperative.\n\nOn the other hand, the friends might feel that the author is not supporting the group effort, especially if others are splitting the Airbnb costs. Maybe they wanted to have a group stay to bond or for the convenience of being together. If the Airbnb is organized for the wedding party, perhaps the author is part of that and expected to stay there. However, the author explains their circumstances, which are valid financial hardships.\n\nThe key points here are the author's financial situation and the availability of a free alternative. Friends suggesting they \"suck it up\" might not consider the author's economic struggles. The author isn't refusing to contribute entirely but is asking to opt out of the shared accommodation, which is a personal choice given their circumstances.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, being considerate of others' situations is important. The author is being honest about their constraints and isn't being inconsiderate by staying with family. They're not making others pay more by not joining; they're just not participating. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability, especially with valid reasons and a willingness to contribute in a different way.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
