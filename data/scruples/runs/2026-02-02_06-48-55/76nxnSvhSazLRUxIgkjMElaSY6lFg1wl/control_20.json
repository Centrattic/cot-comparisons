The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding accommodations. The situation is that the friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, costing $200-$500 per person per weekend. The author doesn't want to participate and gives three reasons: job loss, expensive flight, and staying with family nearby for free. Friends say they're selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each point. The author lost their job recently, which is a significant financial hit. That's probably a major reason they can't afford the Airbnb. Then, flying across the country is already expensive, adding to their financial strain. Lastly, they can stay with family, so they don't need the Airbnb. They even offer to chip in a little as a gift, showing willingness to contribute but not in the same way as others.\n\nThe friends think the author is being selfish, but considering their circumstances, it's more about financial constraints rather than selfishness. The author isn't being excluded; they're choosing not to participate. The wedding party is organized by the friend, and it's not mandatory to join. The cost is high for a group of young artists, who might not have much disposable income. The author is using a free option available to them, which is logical.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are making a responsible financial decision based on their situation. They're not refusing to attend the wedding or being unhelpful. They just want to manage their expenses. The friends' suggestion to \"suck it up\" might not consider their current financial difficulties. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
