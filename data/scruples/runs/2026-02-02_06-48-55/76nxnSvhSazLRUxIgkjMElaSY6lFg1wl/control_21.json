The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The context is that the friend is organizing a wedding Airbnb for the weekend, costing $200-$500 per person. The author doesn't want to be included in these accommodations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author just lost their job, which is a significant financial hit. They're also flying across the country, which is expensive. Plus, their family lives 15 minutes away, so they can stay for free. The friends think they're being selfish by not paying for the Airbnb.\n\nThe main points here are financial hardship and alternative arrangements. The author is facing job loss, which affects their ability to spend money. Staying with family is a practical solution that doesn't cost them anything. The friends suggest contributing a little, but the author is worried about the cost of sharing a room when they can get a free room elsewhere.\n\nWeddings can be costly, and people often have different financial situations. The author isn't refusing to attend; they're choosing a more economical option available to them. It's not about being selfish but managing their resources. The friends might feel left out, but the author isn't obligating them to exclude others. They're making a personal choice based on their circumstances.\n\nThe key here is whether declining to participate in the Airbnb is a reasonable decision given their financial situation. Since they have a free alternative and can't afford the Airbnb, it's understandable. The friends might not see it that way, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing their finances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
