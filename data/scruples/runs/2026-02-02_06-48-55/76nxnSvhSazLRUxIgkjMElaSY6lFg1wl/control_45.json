The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, which is expensive, and the author doesn't want to be included. They have three main reasons: job loss, flying across the country, and family nearby offering free accommodation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's reasons are valid. Losing a job would definitely impact their finances, which is a legitimate reason to avoid extra costs. Flying long distances is expensive, so saving on accommodation makes sense. Also, staying with family is a free alternative, which others might not have. The friends group is young and possibly not very well-off, given they're artists in their early 20s, so budget constraints could be common.\n\nThe friends think the author is being selfish. But is it selfish to prioritize their own financial situation? The author isn't refusing to attend or help; they just don't want to pay for an Airbnb when they have a free option. They\u2019re also open to chipping in a little as a gift, which shows they\u2019re not entirely against contributing. The key here is that the author isn't making a demand but explaining their circumstances. \n\nThe friend is organizing the Airbnb for the wedding party, which might be a group decision. However, the author isn't obligated to participate if it's not required. The question is about being in the wrong, which implies a moral obligation. Since the author has a valid reason and a free alternative, they aren't being inconsiderate if they opt out. The friends might feel left out, but the author's choice is based on personal hardship. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons and are making a responsible financial decision given their situation. The friends might be misunderstanding the financial pressures the author is under.\n"
