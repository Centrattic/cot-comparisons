The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend organizing a wedding Airbnb for the wedding party, and the writer doesn't want to be part of it. The friends say they're being selfish. \n\nFirst, the writer's reasons: they lost their job, which is causing financial strain. They also have to fly across the country, which is expensive. Plus, their family lives close by, so they can stay for free. They mention being young artists in their early 20s, which might mean they're on a tight budget.\n\nThe friends argue they should \"suck it up and pay.\" But the writer isn't avoiding the wedding entirely\u2014they're still flying in, which is a big expense. They\u2019re just choosing to save money by staying with family. They even offer to chip in a little as a gift, showing they\u2019re not completely unwilling to contribute.\n\nMarriage is a big deal, but it's also the friend's choice to organize the Airbnb. However, guests aren't obligated to participate. The writer's financial situation is a valid reason not to join, especially since they can stay with family. The friends calling them selfish might not be fair if the writer is managing their own expenses responsibly. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because their circumstances justify their decision.\n"
