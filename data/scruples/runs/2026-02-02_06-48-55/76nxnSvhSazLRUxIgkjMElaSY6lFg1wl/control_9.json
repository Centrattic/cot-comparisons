The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to stay in the wedding AirBnB when they can stay with their family for free. The author's reasons include losing their job, the cost of flying, and being able to stay with family nearby. The friends think they're being selfish, but the author is worried about the expense.\n\nFirst, the author's job loss is a significant financial hit. That's a valid reason to be cautious with spending. Then, they already paid for the flight, which is a big expense. The AirBnB costs $200-$500 per person for the weekend. If they can stay with family for free, it's practical to do so. The friends are young and might not have a lot of money either. The author mentions being willing to chip in a little as a gift, which shows they're trying to contribute but not to the point of financial strain.\n\nWeddings are expensive events, and guests often have different financial situations. It's not unreasonable to seek the most cost-effective option, especially when there's a free alternative. The friends might be frustrated, but the author isn't refusing to participate entirely; they just want to manage their expenses. The key points are the financial hardship from losing a job and the availability of a free option. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
