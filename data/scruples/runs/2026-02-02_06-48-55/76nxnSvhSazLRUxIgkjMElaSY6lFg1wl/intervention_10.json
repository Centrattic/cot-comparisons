The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to participate in the wedding Airbnb.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the author's reasons. They lost their job, which is a significant financial burden. That's a valid point. Also, they're flying across the country, which is expensive, and they have a free place to stay with family nearby. The friends are suggesting they're being selfish by not paying for the Airbnb. \n\nThe friends are young artists, so maybe they have tight budgets too. The author is considering chipping in a little as a gift, which shows they're trying to contribute. The main issue is the cost versus the free alternative. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they just want to save money by staying with family. \n\nWeddings are big events, and people often have different financial situations. The author has a legitimate reason to opt out of the Airbnb setup. It's not about being selfish but managing their own financial hardship. The friends might not realize the severity of job loss. So, the author isn't in the wrong for making a choice that's necessary for their situation.\n"
