The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to stay in the wedding Airbnb. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author's friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding weekend, with costs between $200-$500 per person. The author doesn't want to be part of this setup. Their reasons: they just lost their job, flying across the country is expensive, and their family lives close by where they can stay for free. Some friends think they're being selfish.\n\nFirst, the financial aspect. Losing a job is a significant stressor. The author is probably facing financial instability now. Paying for an Airbnb when they can stay with family is a way to save money, which makes sense. The cost of the flight is already high, so adding Airbnb expenses could be a real burden.\n\nNext, the friends argue that they should \"suck it up and pay.\" But weddings are expensive, and not everyone has the same financial situation. The author's choice to stay with family isn't just about saving money\u2014it's also about reducing overall costs. They even mention being willing to chip in a little as a gift, showing they're not completely against contributing.\n\nThe group is made up of young artists, probably on limited budgets. It's common for people in such groups to have varying financial situations. The author isn't avoiding the wedding itself; they're just choosing a more economical accommodation option. It's their right to manage their expenses, especially under current circumstances.\n\nThe friends might feel left out or think the author isn't being generous enough, but the author's decision is based on practical needs. There's no indication they're trying to avoid the social aspect of the weekend, just that they have a free alternative. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're making a responsible financial decision given their situation.\n"
