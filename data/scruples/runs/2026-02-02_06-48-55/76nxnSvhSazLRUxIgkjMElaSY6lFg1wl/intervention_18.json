The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to join the wedding Airbnb. The author lists their reasons: job loss, expensive flight, and staying with family nearby for free. The friends think they're being selfish, but the author is worried about spending hundreds on a shared room when they can have a free option.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is in six months, so there's time to plan. The Airbnb is for the wedding parties, which I assume means the bridal party and close friends. The cost per person varies a lot, from $200 to $500. The author is flying across the country, which adds significant travel costs. Losing a job recently would definitely strain their finances. Staying with family is a free alternative, so choosing that makes sense financially.\n\nThe friends suggest the author should pay, implying that they should contribute to the group Airbnb despite the cost. But the author is already covering a flight, which is expensive. Paying for an extra Airbnb might be a financial burden. The author is willing to chip in a little as a gift, which shows they're not entirely against contributing, just not the full cost of a shared room when they have a cheaper option.\n\nThe key points here are financial hardship and the availability of a free alternative. The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding; they're just opting out of the more expensive accommodation option. The friends might feel left out, but the author's situation is valid. It's not selfish if it's about managing personal finances during a tough time. The author is prioritizing their financial stability, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, I don't think the author is in the wrong. Their reasons are legitimate, and they're not avoiding the wedding itself. The answer should be B.\n"
