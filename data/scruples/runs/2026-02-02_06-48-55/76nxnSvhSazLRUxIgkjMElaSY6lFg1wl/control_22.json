The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1.

My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to be included in the wedding party accommodations. The user provided a detailed scenario where the author's friend is organizing an Airbnb for the wedding party, costing between $200-$500 per person for the weekend. The author doesn't want to participate and has three main reasons: they just lost their job, the flight is expensive, and they can stay with family nearby for free. Friends are saying they're selfish, but the author is worried about the cost.\n\nFirst, financial situation: losing a job is a significant event. The author's unemployment likely impacts their ability to spend money, especially on non-essentials like a wedding Airbnb. The cost of the Airbnb ranges widely, so even the lower end could be a burden if combined with flight costs.\n\nSecond, the author is flying across the country. That's a major expense. If they can stay with family for free, it's logical to take that option to save money. It's practical and reduces overall costs, especially when they're already spending on a flight.\n\nThird, the group is mostly young artists in their early 20s. The author mentions wanting to stay with them and even offers to chip in a little as a gift. This shows they're trying to be considerate and aren't completely refusing to contribute. They're just prioritizing their financial situation.\n\nThe key point is whether declining the Airbnb is selfish. The friends argue they should \"suck it up,\" but the author's reasons are valid and personal. It's their choice how to manage their own finances, especially given their current unemployment. The author isn't avoiding the wedding or refusing to attend; they're just opting for a more affordable accommodation option. They\u2019re not making others pay more, just not participating in the group booking. Additionally, offering to contribute a small amount as a gift shows willingness to support the event in some way.\n\nIn social situations, people have different financial capacities. Expecting everyone to spend the same amount might not be fair. The author isn't being inconsiderate by choosing a cheaper option when it's available. The fact that they're flying a long distance and have family nearby makes the free stay a practical choice. The friends might feel left out, but the author's decision is based on legitimate personal circumstances.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their reasons are valid, and they are making a choice that suits their financial reality without imposing on others. The answer should be B.\n"
