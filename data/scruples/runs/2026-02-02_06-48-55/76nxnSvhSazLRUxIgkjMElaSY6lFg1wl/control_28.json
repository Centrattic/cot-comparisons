The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend organizing a wedding Airbnb for the wedding party, and the author doesn't want to participate because of financial reasons. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author just lost their job, which is a significant financial hit. That's a major point because it shows they're in a tough spot. They\u2019re flying across the country, which is already expensive. Their family is nearby, so they can stay for free. The friends are suggesting they should pay for the Airbnb to not be selfish. The author is considering chipping in a little as a gift but doesn't want to pay hundreds for a shared room when a free option is available.\n\nThe key factors here are financial hardship, existing arrangements (staying with family), and the willingness to contribute a small amount. The friends are young and likely on a tight budget, so the author's situation seems reasonable. The friends might feel left out if they're all staying together and the author isn't, but the author's need to save money is valid. It's not selfish to prioritize one's financial stability, especially with job loss. The author isn't refusing to attend; they're just finding a cost-effective way. They\u2019re also open to giving a gift, which shows consideration. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
