The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend organizing a wedding Airbnb for the weekend, and the author doesn't want to be part of it. The friends are saying the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They just lost their job, which is a significant financial hit. Traveling across the country is expensive, and they can stay with family nearby for free. The Airbnb costs $200-500 per person, which adds up. The author is worried about spending hundreds on a shared room when they could have a free room. They even mentioned being willing to chip in a little as a gift but not pay full price.\n\nOn the other hand, their friends think they should \"suck it up and pay.\" But why? Maybe the group wants to stay together? The author isn't refusing to attend the wedding, just the Airbnb. They're not avoiding the event; they just have a cheaper alternative. The friends might feel left out if they don't participate, but the author has valid financial constraints.\n\nFinancial hardship is a legitimate reason to decline certain expenses, especially when there's an alternative. The author isn't being selfish if they have a genuine need to save money. They're also making a compromise by offering to contribute a little. The friends might not realize the severity of the author's job loss. \n\nIn many cases, people have different financial situations. It's not fair to pressure someone to spend money they don't have. The author's decision to stay with family is practical. They aren't avoiding the wedding or their friends but choosing a more affordable option. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
