The ones she's looking at are anywhere from $200-$500 for the weekend per person. I'm don't want to be a part of this set up, and some friends have suggested that I'm being selfish and I should just suck it up and pay. Here are my circumstances:\n\n1. I just lost my job, and that's costing me a lot.\n\n2. I'm already flying across the country to go, which is expensive.\n\n3. My family lives 15 minutes away from the wedding location, and I can stay with them for free.\n\nKeep in mind that our group of friends is also comprised mostly of young artists in their early 20's (including myself). I would love to stay with them, and honestly I'd even be willing to chip in a little bit as a gift if it would help, but I just am so worried about spending hundreds of dollars to share a bedroom when I could have my own room for free nearby. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to stay in the Airbnb that the friend organized for the wedding. The writer has three main reasons: they just lost their job, they\u2019re flying across the country which is expensive, and their family lives nearby where they can stay for free. The friends are saying they\u2019re being selfish and should just pay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the writer's circumstances. Losing a job is a significant financial hit, so they might be in a tight spot. Flying across the country is already a big expense, and staying in an expensive Airbnb adds to that. The fact that they can stay with family for free seems like a valid reason not to participate in the group booking. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend organized the Airbnb so everyone could be together, creating a sense of community or making it easier for the wedding party. The writer is choosing not to join, which might make some friends feel excluded or like they're not supporting the event. But is that a valid reason to feel they should pay? The writer mentions they\u2019re willing to chip in a little as a gift, which shows they\u2019re not completely uncooperative.\n\nThe friends might feel that the writer is avoiding their share of the cost, but if they can stay for free elsewhere, it's not like they're avoiding paying altogether. They\u2019re just opting for a cheaper alternative. The writer isn't making the others pay more; they\u2019re just not participating in the group expense. \n\nAlso, considering the age and financial situation of the group (young artists in their 20s), saving money is probably important. The writer isn't being malicious; they\u2019re trying to manage their own finances. The friends calling them selfish might not take into account their current hardship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer has valid reasons based on their personal circumstances. They\u2019re not trying to avoid contributing entirely but are seeking a more economical solution given their situation. The friends\u2019 judgment might stem from not fully understanding the writer\u2019s financial constraints. Therefore, the answer is likely B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
