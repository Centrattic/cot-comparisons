But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong for bringing up the question about dancing with another guy after her boyfriend mentioned wanting a lap dance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple is discussing upcoming events. The boyfriend's friend's birthday includes a strip club, where he might get a lap dance. The author then asks her boyfriend if it's okay if she dances with another guy at her bachelorette party. He's upset, saying the situations are different because he's paying for the lap dance and the stripper isn't interested in sleeping with him, whereas the guy she dances with might want to sleep with her. The author argues that the key is the boyfriend's intentions, not the other person's.\n\nSo, the main issue is the perceived double standard. The author is trying to have an open conversation about boundaries and mutual respect. She's not necessarily wanting to cross any lines but is questioning why his activity is acceptable but hers isn't. He sees it as fundamentally different, but she's pointing out that the intentions of the person involved (the boyfriend) matter more than the other person's intentions.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is trying to express her feelings and seek clarity, which is a healthy approach. She's not forcing him to do anything but is asking about his boundaries. His upset reaction might stem from feeling that her suggestion is a breach of trust, even if she's not intending to have relations with another man. However, the author's question is about parity in how their respective activities are judged.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because she's initiating a conversation about mutual expectations. It's important for both partners to discuss what's acceptable in their relationship. The boyfriend's reaction could indicate that he hasn't fully considered the implications of his own boundaries, or maybe he's uncomfortable with the idea of his partner engaging in any activity that could be seen as flirtatious or intimate with someone else, even if it's just dancing. \n\nHowever, whether she's in the wrong might depend on their prior agreements. If they've established certain boundaries and she's overstepping them, then she might be at fault. But from the given information, there's no mention of prior agreements; it's more about the momentary discussion. Her intent is to understand and ensure fairness, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's discomfort might be more about his own insecurities rather than a clear violation of agreed-upon rules.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's engaging in a valid conversation about relationship boundaries and seeking to understand her partner's perspective, which is a healthy part of any relationship. The conflict arises from differing views on what's acceptable, but that doesn't necessarily make her the wrong party.\n"
