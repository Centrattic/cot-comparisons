But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asking if it's okay for her to dance with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend is upset because he sees the two situations as different. He argues that in a strip club, he's paying for a service where the stripper isn't interested in sleeping with him, whereas if the author dances with another guy, that guy might have romantic or sexual intentions. The author thinks the intention matters more\u2014since the boyfriend isn't interested in sleeping with the stripper, it's okay, and similarly, if she's just dancing with someone else without intentions, it should be okay.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the comparison between a lap dance and dancing with another guy at a party is valid. The boyfriend's main issue is about the context and the potential intentions of the other person. The author is trying to be fair and open, but maybe she didn't consider how her boyfriend perceives the difference in social contexts.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual understanding are crucial. The author's question might have come from a place of wanting to be equal and not restrict her own fun, but if the boyfriend is uncomfortable with the idea of her dancing with another guy regardless of his intentions, then maybe she didn't fully respect his feelings. Even if she thinks the intentions are the same, the social norms and expectations in a strip club versus a bachelorette party are different. The presence of other people, the setting, and the potential for misinterpretation could play a role here.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's hurt feelings suggest that the way she brought it up might have made him feel disrespected or not trusted. Even if her intent was genuine curiosity, the impact was causing him distress. The author might need to acknowledge his perspective and find a compromise, like agreeing not to dance with other guys if it's a dealbreaker for him, even if she personally doesn't see the difference. \n\nSo, while the author's logic is sound in terms of intentions, the situation is about mutual trust and boundaries in a relationship. If she agreed to the lap dance because she trusts his intentions, then she should extend the same trust to him regarding not dancing with others. However, maybe the contexts are different enough that the boyfriend's discomfort is valid. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not fully considering his feelings and the nuances of the situations.\n"
