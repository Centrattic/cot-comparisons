But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting a lap dance at his friend's strip club party, and the author asks if her boyfriend would be okay with her dancing with another guy at her bachelorette party. He got upset, and they're arguing about whether the situations are the same.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze their perspectives. The boyfriend argues that a lap dance is different because he's paying a stripper who doesn't want to sleep with him, while the author thinks the intentions matter more. The author's point is that if she doesn't have intentions, then why is it a problem. The boyfriend is hurt by the comparison, seeing it as unequal treatment.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to ask that question and compare the two scenarios. In relationships, communication and mutual understanding are key. The author's intention was to express her desire to enjoy the party without guilt, but the boyfriend took it as an accusation or a challenge to his trust. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by bringing up the comparison. She wanted to ensure fairness and trust, which is reasonable. However, the way she framed the question might have been insensitive, especially if it hurt his feelings. The boyfriend's reaction shows he values the distinction between paid lap dances (which he sees as separate from romantic intentions) and dancing with someone else (which he perceives as potentially leading to a romantic connection). \n\nThe author's logic is that intentions matter, but the boyfriend's perspective is about the nature of the interactions. Since relationships require compromise, maybe the author should have considered that his discomfort is valid even if she doesn't see it the same way. However, she also has a right to express her needs. The problem arises if the comparison was made to undermine his feelings rather than to seek understanding. \n\nIn the end, whether she's in the wrong depends on the context. If she was genuinely trying to have an open conversation and didn't mean to hurt him, then maybe not. But if she dismissed his feelings or made him feel like he was being hypocritical without considering his viewpoint, then she might be in the wrong. The situation seems more about differing perspectives rather than a clear right or wrong. The author isn't necessarily wrong, but could have handled the conversation more sensitively.\n"
