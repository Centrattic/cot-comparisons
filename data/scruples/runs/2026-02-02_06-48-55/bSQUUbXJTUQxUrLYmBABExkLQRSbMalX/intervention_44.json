But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking her boyfriend if it's okay for her to dance with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party, after he's mentioned wanting to get a lap dance at his friend's birthday at a strip club. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The boyfriend is going to a strip club and might get a lap dance, which the author is okay with if he's not having sex with the stripper. She then asks if it's okay for her to dance with another guy, but the boyfriend objects. The author argues that the key is the intention of the person involved, not the other person's motives. The boyfriend sees it as different because the guy at the bachelorette might want to sleep with her, while the stripper isn't interested in his lap dance. \n\nSo, the main issue is about mutual respect and trust in the relationship. The author is testing boundaries by comparing two different scenarios. The boyfriend is hurt that she would even consider dancing with another guy, even if she's not into it. The author might be trying to see if there's double standards in their relationship, but her approach might come off as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author's initial intention was to check with him, which is good, but the way she framed it might have been confrontational. She's pointing out a perceived inconsistency in his views, but that could be seen as challenging his feelings or not respecting his boundaries. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is valid because he's expressing his discomfort, and even if her logic is sound, his feelings matter. The author's insistence on her logic might not take into account how her actions (even hypothetical ones) affect his emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be fair and wants mutual respect. She's not going to dance with someone else if it makes him uncomfortable, but she's pointing out that her actions are similar in intent to his. However, the contexts are different: a strip club is a different environment from a bachelorette party, and societal norms might view them differently. \n\nIn relationships, perceptions and emotions play a big role. Even if the author's logic is rational, the boyfriend's emotional response is real. She might not be in the wrong in terms of her reasoning, but she might not be considering how her questions are making him feel. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she's not respecting her boyfriend's feelings and is challenging his boundaries in a way that's hurtful. Alternatively, it could be B (not in the wrong) because she's trying to establish fair boundaries and is willing to compromise. \n\nBut given that the boyfriend was clearly hurt and the author's comparison might be invalidating his feelings, it's more likely that she's in the wrong. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
