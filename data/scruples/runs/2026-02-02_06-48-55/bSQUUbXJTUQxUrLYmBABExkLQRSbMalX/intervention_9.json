But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at a strip club for a friend's birthday. The author, wanting to be fair and also have fun at her own bachelorette party, asked if it's okay for her to dance with another guy there. The boyfriend got upset because he doesn't see it the same way. He argues that the lap dance is different because he's paying for a service and the stripper isn't interested in sleeping with him, whereas another guy at her party might be. The author counters that intentions matter, not the other person's, and that she's not interested in anything beyond dancing.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of their relationship. They've been together over a year, and this is their first significant fight. The author wants to be fair, which is a good intention. But maybe she didn't consider how her question might make him feel. The core issue is about trust and boundaries in a relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's main point is that the contexts are different. A lap dance at a strip club is a paid service, and the stripper isn't there for romantic or sexual intentions towards him. However, dancing with another guy at a bachelorette party might be perceived differently. Even if the author isn't interested, the act of dancing with another guy might still be a dealbreaker for her boyfriend. \n\nThe author's logic is that if her intentions are good, then it's okay. But in relationships, it's not just about one's own intentions but also about respecting the partner's feelings and boundaries. Even if she doesn't plan on sleeping with someone, her boyfriend might not see it that way. Communication is key here. She asked if that's okay, and his answer was no. So, by proceeding despite his clear discomfort, she could be in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, she also mentioned she's okay with not dancing at all. Maybe she was just trying to understand his perspective. However, bringing up the comparison might have been the trigger. The boyfriend felt hurt because she compared their situations, which he didn't see as equivalent. The author might have thought it's a fair comparison, but in reality, the contexts are different in terms of social norms and relationship expectations. \n\nIn some relationships, dancing with others is acceptable, but in others, it's a red flag. The problem here is that the boyfriend didn't agree to that, and the author might have crossed a line by suggesting it, even if she was just asking. The key is whether she respected his boundaries once he said no. If she still goes ahead without considering his feelings, that's wrong. However, if she's willing to comply with his wishes, maybe she's not in the wrong. But since the question is about whether she is in the wrong, and the scenario ends with the boyfriend being hurt, it's possible she is. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't respect his boundary after he expressed discomfort. Even if she thought the logic was sound, the emotional impact on him matters. Relationships require mutual respect, and pushing a boundary that he clearly didn't agree with could be seen as wrong.\n"
