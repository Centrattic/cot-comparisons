But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. The situation involves a boyfriend wanting to get a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asks if he'd be okay with her dancing with another guy at her bachelorette party. The boyfriend gets upset, and the author wants to know if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend argues that lap dances are different because he's paying for a service from a stripper who might have different intentions, while the author thinks the key is their own intentions. The author is trying to have a fair discussion about mutual boundaries, but the boyfriend feels hurt. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she asked a question to express her feelings and seek clarity. It's part of communication in a relationship. However, maybe she didn't consider how her question might come off, especially if the context is sensitive. But from her perspective, she's trying to be fair and understand his stance. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is about his comfort and trust issues. The author isn't saying she'll do it, just that she's curious about the difference. While there's a difference in the scenarios (stripper vs. dancing with someone who might have romantic intentions), the author is trying to address the discrepancy. \n\nIt's a communication issue rather than her being wrong outright. She's not violating any boundaries yet; she's just discussing potential future actions. So, the answer probably isn't \"A\" (she's in the wrong). It's more about differing views on what's acceptable. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
