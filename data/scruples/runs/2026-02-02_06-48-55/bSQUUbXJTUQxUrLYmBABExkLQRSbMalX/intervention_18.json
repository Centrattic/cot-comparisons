But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at his friend's strip club event, and the author is asking if that's okay. In return, the author questions if her boyfriend would be okay with her dancing with another guy at her bachelorette party. The boyfriend gets upset and says the two situations are different because in a strip club, the stripper is being paid and doesn't want to sleep with him, whereas a guy at a bachelorette dance might have romantic intentions. The author argues that the boyfriend's intentions matter, not the other person's, and that she wouldn't have any intention beyond dancing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together over a year and the author says she wants to be trusting and fair. She's trying to find a balance between allowing her boyfriend to have fun and expressing her own desire to have fun too. But when she brings up the hypothetical scenario, the boyfriend is upset. \n\nThe key point here is about boundaries and mutual respect. The author is trying to test the boundaries by comparing two situations. She's not necessarily saying she'll dance with someone, but she's questioning why one is acceptable and the other isn't. The boyfriend's reaction is based on the premise that the contexts are different: a paid, professional setting versus a social dance where romantic intentions are more likely. \n\nThe author's logic is that as long as her intentions are good, it's okay. But the boyfriend feels hurt and sees it as a double standard. The problem here might be communication. The author didn't just ask for permission but framed it as a comparison, which might have made the boyfriend feel that she's challenging the trust he has with her. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel comfortable and respected. Even if the author thinks her intentions are clear, the way she brought up the question could be seen as a test or a challenge to his boundaries. The boyfriend's hurt feelings indicate that he felt the comparison was unfair, which could lead to resentment. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It could depend on how the question was framed. If she was genuinely curious and wanted to discuss boundaries, but the way she phrased it made the boyfriend feel disrespected, then maybe she could have approached the conversation differently. However, if she was trying to negotiate mutual understanding and her boyfriend overreacted, then maybe he's the one being unreasonable. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering that she initiated a discussion that led to hurt feelings, even if her intent was to be fair, she might have been inconsiderate of his perspective. The answer might lean towards A, but I'm a bit conflicted. The core issue is about mutual agreement and communication. If the author didn't consider how her question would be received, she might be in the wrong. But if the boyfriend is being overly controlling, then she's not. The author's own statement that she's okay not dancing suggests she's willing to compromise, but the way she framed the question could have been more thoughtful.\n"
