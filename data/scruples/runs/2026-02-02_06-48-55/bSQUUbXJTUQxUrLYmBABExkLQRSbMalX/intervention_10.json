But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their boyfriend wanting to get a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asking if it's okay if she dances with another guy at her bachelorette party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author's argument is that if they're both in different events and the intentions are about having fun without crossing into romantic boundaries, then why the double standard? The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels that lap dances and dancing with another guy are different because the stripper is paid and there's a professional boundary, whereas dancing with another guy might imply more personal interest.\n\nI should consider the context of their relationship. They've been together over a year, so they likely have established some level of trust and understanding. The author's question seems to come from a place of wanting to have fun and testing the boundaries of their relationship. But the boyfriend's reaction indicates he feels uncomfortable with the idea, possibly due to jealousy or different views on what's acceptable behavior in a relationship.\n\nMonogamy in relationships often involves agreed-upon boundaries. If the boyfriend is okay with the author dancing at her bachelorette but not with her dancing with another guy, there's a perceived inconsistency. However, the boyfriend's reasoning about the stripper's lack of romantic intent versus a guy at the bachelorette wanting to sleep with her could be a factor. The author's argument is that their intentions matter, not the other person's, but the boyfriend might see it as a breach of trust regardless of the other person's intentions.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author asked for permission, which shows they tried to be considerate. But the boyfriend's hurt feelings suggest that the way the question was framed might have been triggering. The author might not have considered how their question could be perceived as challenging the boyfriend's boundaries or testing his trust.\n\nCultural norms might also play a role. Some people might see dancing with another person at a party as more casual than a paid lap dance, but others might not. The key here is mutual respect for each other's feelings and boundaries. If the boyfriend is hurt by the suggestion, the author might need to acknowledge his feelings even if they don't fully agree.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to ask for permission and seek fairness, the boyfriend's feelings of hurt and the established boundaries suggest that the author might have overstepped. The author's perspective is valid in wanting to have fun, but in a relationship, respecting the partner's feelings and boundaries is crucial. So the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't fully consider their partner's emotional response, even if their logic was sound.\n"
