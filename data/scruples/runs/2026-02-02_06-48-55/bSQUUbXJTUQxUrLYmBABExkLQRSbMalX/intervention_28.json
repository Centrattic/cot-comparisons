But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend wanting a lap dance at his friend's birthday party, and the author asking if it's okay for her to dance with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend was upset by the question.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasoning is that the key factor is the partner's intentions. She's okay with the lap dance if her boyfriend isn't interested in sleeping with the stripper, even if the stripper might have other intentions. Conversely, she's questioning why dancing with a guy who might have intentions is different. The boyfriend argues that lap dances are a paid service with clear boundaries, whereas dancing with someone else is different because the guy's intentions might be romantic or sexual, and he's not okay with that.\n\nFrom a relationship dynamics perspective, trust and mutual respect are crucial. The author's question might have come from a place of wanting to ensure fairness and understanding, but it's possible that the way she framed the question made her boyfriend feel disrespected or doubted. The boyfriend's hurt feelings suggest that he saw her question as implying that his actions (getting a lap dance) are equivalent to her dancing with another guy, which he finds unacceptable. \n\nThe key here is whether the author should have considered how her question would be perceived. Even if her intention was genuine, the result was causing hurt. In relationships, communication style matters. Asking \"how is this different?\" might have been seen as challenging his boundaries or minimizing his feelings. The author's logic is valid from a logical standpoint, but relationships also involve emotional responses. \n\nThe boyfriend's stance is about the nature of the interactions: a lap dance is a professional service, while dancing with another guy could lead to romantic interest, which he's uncomfortable with. The author's argument that the partner's intentions are what matter might not account for the social context and the boyfriend's personal discomfort. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention wasn't malicious, the question might have disregarded her boyfriend's feelings and boundaries, making her at least partially in the wrong. The answer would likely be A, but there's a nuanced element where both parties' perspectives need to be considered. However, since the question asks for a yes or no, the answer leans towards A.\n"
