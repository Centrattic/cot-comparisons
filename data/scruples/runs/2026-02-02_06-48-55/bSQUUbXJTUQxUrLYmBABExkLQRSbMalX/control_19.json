But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple discussing whether the boyfriend can get a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asking if it would be okay for her to dance with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset, saying the situations are different because the stripper's intentions might be different, while the author argues it's about the boyfriend's intentions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points are mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The author is trying to make a fair comparison between the two scenarios, but the boyfriend sees them as different. The author's question is out of curiosity and a desire to be fair, not to challenge the boyfriend's boundaries. However, the boyfriend feels hurt, so the author might be unintentionally overstepping.\n\nThe author's logic is that if the boyfriend is allowed to get a lap dance (which is part of a strip club's service), then she should be able to dance with another guy if she chooses. But the boyfriend's perspective is that the lap dance is a paid service with no romantic intent, whereas dancing with another guy might imply different intentions. The author is pointing out that the intentions of the other person shouldn't matter as long as her own intentions are clear.\n\nHowever, relationships often hinge on each partner's comfort levels. Even if logically the situations seem similar, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The author's question might have been framed as a challenge, making the boyfriend feel his boundaries are being questioned. The author could have approached it differently, maybe focusing more on reassurance rather than making a direct comparison.\n\nBut the author wasn't necessarily in the wrong for asking. She was trying to understand and ensure fairness. The problem might be in how the question was posed rather than the intention itself. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or a different perspective on what's acceptable in the relationship. So, while the author's logic has merit, the situation's outcome depends on mutual agreement and communication. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but she might need to address the boyfriend's feelings more carefully.\n"
