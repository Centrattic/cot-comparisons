But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple discussing their upcoming events. The boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at his friend's birthday party, and the author asks if he's okay with her dancing with another guy at her bachelorette party.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the comparison between the boyfriend getting a lap dance and the author dancing with another guy. The boyfriend argues that they're different because he's paying for a service, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, whereas the guy she dances with might. The author counters that their intentions matter more, not the other person's.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's perspective is that the contexts are different. Lap dances are a known part of strip clubs, and even if he's not interested in sleeping with the stripper, the setup is different. The author thinks intent is what matters, so if she doesn't intend to sleep with the guy, it's okay.\n\nBut in relationships, it's not just about personal intent but also about how each partner perceives and respects the other's boundaries. The boyfriend was clearly hurt and upsets when she suggested the possibility of her dancing with another guy. Even if the author thinks it's about intent, the boyfriend's feelings and perspective are valid. The fact that he was upset shows that this crossed a line for him. The author might not have intended to hurt him, but she didn't consider how her suggestion would affect him emotionally. \n\nAlso, the comparison isn't entirely fair. A lap dance in a strip club is a paid service, while dancing with someone else in a social setting, even if just dancing, can be perceived as more intimate or as a social move, especially in a bachelorette party. The boyfriend's discomfort is about the different contexts and the potential implications, even if the author doesn't see it that way.\n\nSo, while the author's intention was to be fair and curious, she didn't account for her boyfriend's feelings and the inherent differences in the situations. She might not be \"wrong\" in her logic, but she did overlook how her words made him feel. Therefore, she's partially in the wrong because she didn't respect his feelings and boundaries as much as she should have, even if she believes her reasoning is sound.\n"
