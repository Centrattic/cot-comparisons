But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing whether it's okay for the boyfriend to get a lap dance at a strip club versus the girlfriend dancing with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasoning is that if her boyfriend can get a lap dance (which might involve a stripper who might want to sleep with him), then she should be allowed to dance with another guy as long as her intentions are pure. The boyfriend is upset because he sees the situations as different: he's paying for a service where the woman's intentions might not matter, but he doesn't want his girlfriend to dance with someone who likely has romantic or sexual intentions.\n\nThe key here is about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The author's question is about whether she was wrong to suggest dancing with another guy, which led to conflict. The boyfriend felt hurt, which is a valid emotion. The author might not see the difference in the situations because she focuses on her own intentions, but the boyfriend's perspective is about the other person's intentions and the nature of the interactions. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she was honest about her feelings and asked for his opinion, which is good. But maybe she didn't consider that the contexts are different. Dancing with a guy at a party could be more personal and intimate compared to a professional lap dance. The boyfriend's hurt feelings suggest that he valued monogamy and trust, and the idea of her dancing with someone else might trigger jealousy even if she has no plans to sleep with that person. \n\nHowever, she was also trying to be fair and wanted to be open about their expectations. It's possible that the conflict arises from differing views on what's acceptable in their relationship. The author's logic is consistent, but relationships often require compromise. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable, it's reasonable for her to respect his feelings, even if she doesn't see the difference. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. She might not be in the wrong for asking, but perhaps she should have been more sensitive to his feelings and the social dynamics at play. The fact that he was clearly hurt indicates that her actions caused pain, even if her intentions were good. But it's also important for the boyfriend to communicate why his perspective matters. \n\nIn many cases, the person who feels hurt is also in a position to explain their perspective. The author might not be in the wrong, but she could have handled the discussion more empathetically. However, the question is whether she is in the wrong, and the answer depends on whose perspective is prioritized. Since the boyfriend's feelings were hurt, the author might need to acknowledge that, but it's not necessarily her fault. \n\nI think the answer here is a bit of both, but since the options are A or B, I need to choose. The author might be in the right (B) because she was trying to be fair and asked for his opinion, but the boyfriend's feelings are valid. However, if the argument is that the situations are different, then she might be in the wrong (A) for not respecting that difference. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is B because she wasn't trying to be malicious and was seeking understanding.\n"
