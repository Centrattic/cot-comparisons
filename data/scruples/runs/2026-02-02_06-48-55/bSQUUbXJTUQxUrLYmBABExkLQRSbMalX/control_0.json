But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at his friend's birthday event, which is a strip club. The author then asks if the boyfriend would be okay with her dancing with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend got upset, saying the situations are different because he's paying for the lap dance and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while if the author danced with another guy, that guy would probably want to sleep with her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key point is about mutual trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author is trying to understand her boyfriend's perspective and is asking a question out of genuine curiosity and to check her own behavior's acceptability. She's not trying to be manipulative or hurt him, just exploring her own actions in light of his. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is based on the perceived difference between a paid professional service (lap dance) and a social interaction (dancing with another guy) that might lead to romantic/sexual intent. He might feel that the lap dance is a consensual, transactional experience, whereas the author dancing with another guy could imply emotional or physical interest, which he might find more threatening to the relationship. \n\nThe author's logic is that it's the intentions of her partner that matter, not the other person's. She's emphasizing that if she knows her boyfriend isn't interested in sleeping with the stripper, then her concern is addressed. She also mentions she's fine with not dancing at all, but wants to understand the equity in the situation.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, it's common for partners to feel different about their own actions versus their partner's. The author isn't pressuring him to do anything but is trying to see if there's a double standard. However, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid because he's expressing his feelings and boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong for asking, as it's a way to communicate and set expectations. But maybe she didn't consider that her question could be perceived as a challenge to his boundaries. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable by equating the two? Maybe she didn't account for the fact that the contexts are different. A bachelorette party is a social event where dancing with others is more common, but for some, it can still feel like a boundary is being crossed. The boyfriend might not see the two situations as equivalent because the lap dance is a paid service without romantic intent, while dancing with another guy in a social setting might be seen as more personal. \n\nThe author's intention is to be fair and to have fun, but she needs to respect her boyfriend's feelings and perspectives. Even if she believes her logic is sound, his hurt feelings indicate that the question was a sensitive one. So, while the author isn't necessarily wrong in her reasoning, she might have overlooked the emotional impact of her question. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key, and sometimes even if the intent is good, the execution can cause hurt. The author could be in the wrong if her question was meant to test his boundaries or provoke a reaction, but from her description, it seems she was genuinely curious and trying to be fair. However, it's possible that she should have considered his feelings more before bringing it up. \n\nBut the main issue is that she asked for his opinion on a hypothetical scenario where she might engage in a similar activity. If both partners are willing to discuss and agree on boundaries, that's part of a healthy relationship. Her asking shows she's trying to be open and communicative. The boyfriend's response is about his own comfort, but the author's action of asking isn't inherently wrong. She might just need to have a deeper conversation to understand his perspective and ensure mutual respect. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's engaging in communication to understand and set boundaries, which is healthy. However, the nuance here is that she could have approached it differently to avoid hurting his feelings, but the question itself isn't an act of being an asshole. It's more about differing perspectives and the need for discussion rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
