But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author and their boyfriend have been in a relationship for over a year, and they had a first fight about attending events where each might be in a different situation. The boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at his friend's birthday at a strip club, and the author, wanting to be fair, asked if the boyfriend would be okay with her dancing with another guy at the bachelorette party. The boyfriend was upset and distinguished between the two scenarios: he's paying for a service where the stripper isn't interested in sleeping with him, while the author dancing with another guy would imply the guy might want to sleep with her. The author argues that the intention matters, not the other person's motives.\n\nHmm. The key here is consent and communication in a relationship. The author made a genuine inquiry to check if their boyfriend would be okay with a similar situation for them. That seems reasonable. However, the boyfriend's reaction was about how the scenarios are different. The author's question might have come off as challenging his trust or implying hypocrisy, even if their intention was to be fair. But the author's stance is about mutual respect and understanding. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to acknowledge that partners might have different boundaries, even if the situations seem similar. The author's logic is sound in that they care about their boyfriend's intentions, not the other person's. But the boyfriend might feel that the contexts are different because one is a consensual paid service and the other is a potential romantic overture. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They asked a question to express their feelings and see if there's mutual understanding. They weren't planning to dance with someone else but wanted to understand their boyfriend's perspective. The boyfriend's hurt feelings might be due to the comparison he didn't agree with. But since they communicated, and the author was honest, maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a matter of differing boundaries, not necessarily one party being wrong. So answer B.\n"
