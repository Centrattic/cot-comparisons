But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong for questioning her boyfriend's comfort level with her dancing with another guy at a bachelorette party, while he's okay with getting a lap dance at a strip club.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend is upset because he sees the two situations as different. He argues that in a strip club, he's paying for a service where the intention isn't sexual, whereas if the girl dances with another guy, the guy might have sexual intentions. The girlfriend, on the other hand, thinks the key is the intentions of the people involved. She believes that as long as her boyfriend isn't intending to sleep with the stripper, the situation is okay, and similarly, if she's just dancing without intentions, it's the same.\n\nNow, the core issue here is trust and boundaries in their relationship. The girlfriend is trying to level the playing field, suggesting that if he can do X, why can't she do Y. But the boyfriend feels that X and Y aren't equivalent because of the contexts and potential intentions involved. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The girlfriend's question might have come from a place of wanting fairness, but she might not have considered how her boyfriend perceives the different contexts. The boyfriend's reaction indicates that he's uncomfortable with the idea of her dancing with another guy, possibly because it feels more personal or he's worried about her safety or his own insecurities. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's point isn't entirely without merit. If both parties agree that their actions are consensual and within boundaries, then mutual respect should guide the situation. But in this case, the boyfriend has made it clear that he's not okay with her dancing with another guy, which is his right in a relationship. The author's question might have been a test of boundaries that the boyfriend wasn't comfortable with, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the question was meant to push boundaries or to genuinely explore mutual understanding. If the girlfriend asked out of curiosity and to test the fairness of the situation, she might not be in the wrong for expressing her viewpoint. However, if she didn't consider her boyfriend's feelings and boundaries, then she might be at fault for not respecting his comfort level. The key here is whether the question was respectful and part of an open dialogue or if it was a challenge to his stance. Since the user says the question was out of genuine curiosity, maybe she's not in the wrong, but the boyfriend's reaction is valid because it's about his own comfort and their relationship dynamics. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The girlfriend's logic is understandable, but if the boyfriend feels hurt, she should acknowledge that and find a middle ground. The answer here isn't black and white. However, since the user asked for a choice between A or B, and considering that the girlfriend's question might have disregarded her boyfriend's specific boundaries without full consideration, the answer might lean towards her being in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the question was part of a healthy discussion about mutual expectations, then she's not in the wrong. The context matters a lot here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe they're looking for confirmation. But I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
