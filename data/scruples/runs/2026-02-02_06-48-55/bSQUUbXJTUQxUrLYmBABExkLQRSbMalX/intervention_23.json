But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple discussing whether it's okay for the boyfriend to get a lap dance at his friend's party and the author asking if the boyfriend would be okay with her dancing with another guy at her bachelorette party. The boyfriend got upset and said they're different because he's paying for a stripper who doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy she dances with might want to sleep with her. The author argues that as long as her intentions are good, it's the same. \n\nHmm. First, the key point here is about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The author's question might have been a way to test boundaries or express her own wants, but the boyfriend felt hurt. The author's logic is about intentions versus the other person's intentions. But maybe the boyfriend sees the situations as fundamentally different: one is a paid transaction with a professional (stripper) where the relationship is temporary and transactional, versus dancing with someone (which might be in a more social setting where there's potential for romantic interest). \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, asking the question might be her way of trying to understand his perspective and her own. However, the boyfriend's feelings are valid because he felt hurt and saw it as different. The author might not be wrong for having her own perspective, but she might not have considered that her question could be perceived as challenging his boundaries or implying that his activity is equivalent to hers. It's possible that her question was framed in a way that made him feel like she was comparing their experiences in a way he wasn't comfortable with. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate and respect each other's comfort levels. The author's intention might have been to seek clarity, but the way she phrased it could have been hurtful. So, while she's not necessarily wrong in her own reasoning, she might be in the wrong for not considering how her question affected him. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't account for his feelings and the different contexts he presented.\n"
