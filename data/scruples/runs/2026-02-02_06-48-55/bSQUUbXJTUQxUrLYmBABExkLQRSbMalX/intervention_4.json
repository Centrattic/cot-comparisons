But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at a strip club. The author is asking if that's okay, but then turns around and questions whether the boyfriend would be okay with her dancing with another guy at her bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset and says the situations are different. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that if the boyfriend's intentions are okay (he just wants a lap dance without anything more), then her dancing with someone else with no intention of sleeping with him should be the same. The boyfriend argues that the contexts are different: a stripper in a club is part of the service, and the guy at the bachelorette party would likely want a romantic connection, which they wouldn't have. \n\nSo, the key points are about trust, boundaries, and how each partner perceives the situation. The author might feel they're being fair by drawing a parallel, but the boyfriend sees the two scenarios as fundamentally different. In relationships, communication and mutual understanding are crucial. Even if the author's logic is sound, the boyfriend's feelings are valid here. If he's hurt and sees it as a betrayal of trust, then the author's question might have been insensitive. \n\nHowever, the author is also trying to express their own desire to have fun and be treated equally. It's a conflict between different values: the author focuses on intentions and equality, while the boyfriend is concerned about the social context and potential implications. \n\nIn many relationships, certain boundaries are set implicitly. Strip clubs are often seen as places where the rules are different because they're commercial and the participants are professionals. Dancing with someone else in a social setting might be perceived as more personal and could lead to misunderstandings. The author's question might have crossed a boundary the boyfriend had without realizing it.\n\nSo, considering that the author's action (asking about dancing with another guy) caused hurt and the boyfriend's perspective is valid, even if the author's reasoning is logical, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional impact. But there's also a case for the author's right to express their needs. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and the boyfriend was clearly upset, the answer might be A.\n"
