But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asking if that's okay given that she would be okay with dancing with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend was upset and said it's different because the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, whereas the guy she dances with might. The author argues that intentions matter, not the other person's intentions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and her boyfriend have a one-year relationship. The key issue is the perceived double standard. The author is trying to understand her boyfriend's boundaries and is curious about whether her actions (dancing with another guy) would be acceptable. She's not necessarily planning to do it, just exploring the fairness of the situation. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is based on the idea that the contexts are different. In a strip club, the lap dance is a paid service, and the stripper's intentions might not align with the client's. He's not okay with the author dancing with another guy because he believes the guy's intentions could lead to more, which he's uncomfortable with. \n\nThe author's logic is that as long as her own intentions are pure (dancing only), it's not about the other person's intentions. She sees it as a similar level of intimacy or risk. However, the boyfriend feels hurt because he thinks there's an inherent difference in the situations. \n\nI need to assess if the author overstepped. She asked a question to clarify boundaries, which is reasonable in a relationship. However, the way she framed it might have invalidated his feelings. By comparing the lap dance to dancing with another guy, she might be minimizing his perspective. Even if her logic is sound, relationships often require mutual respect for each other's comfort levels. \n\nThe boyfriend's hurt feelings suggest that the author's question was a trigger for him, possibly because he's more sensitive about her interactions with other men. While she's not wrong in her reasoning, the act of bringing up the comparison could be seen as disregarding his feelings. The problem here might be communication\u2014she's trying to be fair, but he's feeling disrespected. \n\nIn such cases, it's not always a clear right or wrong. But the question is whether she was the asshole. Since she was trying to understand and set boundaries, and her actions weren't malicious, it's possible she's not in the wrong. However, the fact that her boyfriend felt hurt and she continued to argue the point might tip the balance. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she was trying to communicate and find a mutual understanding. However, it's a close call. The key is that she wasn't planning to dance with someone else, just exploring the fairness. The boyfriend needs to express his feelings, but the author isn't the asshole for asking. So B.\n"
