But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing whether it's okay for the boyfriend to get a lap dance at a strip club versus the girlfriend dancing with another guy at a bachelorette party. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's boyfriend got upset when she asked if it's okay for her to dance with another guy, comparing it to him getting a lap dance. He argues that the lap dance is paid for and the stripper isn't interested in sleeping with him, whereas the guy she dances with might want to sleep with her. She counters that she doesn't care about the other person's intentions, only her boyfriend's, and she's fine with him getting a lap dance if he's okay with her dancing with another guy.\n\nNow, the key points here are about mutual trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to ask, as communication is important. But maybe the issue is that the boyfriend felt the comparison was unfair, leading to hurt feelings. The question is whether her logic is valid or if she overstepped.\n\nOn one hand, she's trying to be fair and express her own needs. On the other, the boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he feels the situations are different. Jealousy and insecurity can play a role, especially if the dance with another guy feels more intimate or ambiguous. The author might not be wrong, but maybe she didn't consider how the question would make him feel, even if her reasoning is logical. Relationships often involve compromise, so if the boyfriend is hurt, maybe she should acknowledge his feelings even if she stands by her logic.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the question was inconsiderate. Since she asked out of genuine curiosity and wanted to be fair, it's not entirely her fault. But if the way she framed the comparison hurt his feelings, maybe she's partially responsible. But the boyfriend's reaction is also about his own insecurities. The AITA usually leans towards the person who is less considerate or more at fault. Here, since both have valid points, but she's trying to communicate her needs, maybe she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
