But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing whether it's okay for each to engage in certain activities at separate events. The boyfriend is upset when the author suggests she might dance with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party, comparing it to him getting a lap dance at his friend's birthday. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together over a year, and this is their first significant fight. The author wanted to check if her boyfriend was okay with her dancing with another guy, which shows she's trying to be considerate. However, her boyfriend felt hurt, indicating that the comparison made him uncomfortable.\n\nThe key issue here is mutual respect and boundaries. The author argues that the intention matters\u2014her boyfriend's action is a paid service with no intent beyond the dance, while she's just dancing. But her boyfriend sees the lap dance as part of the club's normal activities, not implying romantic intent. The author's comparison might overlook the different contexts: a paid, professional setting versus a social, potentially romantic one. \n\nThe problem arises because even if the author doesn't have intentions, her boyfriend's perspective is that the situations aren't equivalent. His reaction shows that the comparison hurt him, possibly because he sees her action as a breach of trust or a threat to their relationship. The author might have failed to recognize his feelings and the inherent differences in the scenarios, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong not because her logic is flawed, but because she didn't account for her boyfriend's feelings and the emotional impact of her words. Communication and understanding each other's viewpoints are crucial here. The answer would be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because she caused hurt feelings by not respecting his perspective, even if her intention was to be fair.\n"
