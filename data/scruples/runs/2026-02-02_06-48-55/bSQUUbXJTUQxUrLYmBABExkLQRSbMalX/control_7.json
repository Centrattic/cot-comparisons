But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with her boyfriend. They had a fight when discussing upcoming separate events: his friend's party at a strip club and her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at the strip club. The author asked if he would be okay with her dancing with another guy at the bachelorette party. He got upset and said it's different because strippers are paid, don't want to sleep with him, while another guy at the bachelorette might have intentions. The author argues that her intentions matter, not the other person's, and that she's willing not to dance if he's uncomfortable. He insists they're not the same and is hurt by the question.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. Communication is key in relationships. The author's question was out of genuine curiosity and trying to be fair, but it caused hurt feelings. The boyfriend's reaction might be based on his own insecurities or different views on what's acceptable. \n\nThe author is trying to establish boundaries and mutual respect. She's not forcing her boyfriend to get a lap dance but is questioning why dancing with another guy is different. Her logic is that if she's not intending to sleep with someone, then the act of dancing is okay. However, her boyfriend sees a fundamental difference between paid services (strippers) and social dancing with potential romantic intentions.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she's trying to be fair and open, but maybe she didn't consider how her question might make her boyfriend feel. Even if her intention was to be fair, bringing up the comparison could be triggering for him, especially if he has trust issues. On the other hand, she's also trying to assert her own comfort and autonomy, which is important in a relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's hurt feelings suggest that he felt disrespected or that his boundaries were not considered. However, the author's stance is that she's not violating any boundaries as long as she's upfront about her intentions. \n\nI think the core issue is about differing perspectives on what's acceptable in the relationship. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to have fun and set her own boundaries, but she might not have considered the emotional impact of her question. The boyfriend's reaction is also valid if he feels that dancing with another guy is a red line for him, regardless of the context.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate their needs and boundaries. The author's question was to explore boundaries, but she should be ready to listen to her boyfriend's feelings and adjust accordingly. However, it's not entirely her fault because she's trying to be open and fair. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's room for mutual understanding.\n"
