But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the girl) is in the wrong here. The situation is about her boyfriend wanting a lap dance at a strip club, and she responds by asking if he's okay with her dancing with another guy at her bachelorette party. He gets upset, and now she's unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The boyfriend's argument is that a lap dance is a paid service where the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, whereas if she dances with another guy, the guy might want to sleep with her. He's drawing a distinction between the nature of the interactions. The author counters by saying intentions matter more. She's focused on her boyfriend's intentions, not the other person's, and thinks the situations are similar because both involve dancing. She also says she's okay not dancing at all but brought it up to see if there's mutual understanding.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust, boundaries, and expectations in a relationship. The author's question was an attempt to have a conversation about mutual respect in their relationship. She's not actually planning to dance with someone else but is checking if there's fairness. The boyfriend's hurt feelings come from the comparison, which he sees as equating two different things. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for asking the question? Well, she did it out of curiosity and to ensure mutual understanding. However, maybe the way she framed the question could have been insensitive. But given that she's trying to be fair and open, her intentions seem good. The boyfriend's reaction is about different values regarding physical boundaries, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong. Relationships require communication, and she was engaging in that. The problem might be more about differing views on what's acceptable rather than one party being wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she was trying to have an open discussion about mutual expectations, and her question was a way to explore those boundaries. The boyfriend's hurt feelings stem from his own discomfort with the comparison, but that doesn't mean she was wrong to ask.\n"
