But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend if it's okay for her to dance with another guy at a bachelorette party, after he mentioned wanting a lap dance at a strip club.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasoning is that she's just curious and wants to have fun, and she believes that the key factor is her boyfriend's intentions, not the other person's. She's okay with him getting a lap dance because she trusts him, so she thinks she should be allowed to dance with someone else without judgment, as long as she doesn't intend to sleep with the guy.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is upset because he sees the situations as different. He argues that a lap dance is a paid service where the stripper isn't interested in sleeping with him, but a guy at a bachelorette party would likely have romantic intentions. He's hurt because he feels the comparison is unfair, implying that he might be less trustworthy or that she's doubting his commitment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. It depends on the context of their relationship and their established boundaries. Trust is a big part of any relationship. The author might think she's being fair by offering the same level of trust to herself as he expects from her. However, the boyfriend's hurt feelings suggest that he values monogamy and might see her suggestion as a breach of that trust, even if she doesn't intend to act on it.\n\nThe key point is communication. The author asked if it's okay, and the boyfriend said no. Even if she thinks the situations are similar, his feelings are valid here. By proceeding to suggest dancing with another guy despite his clear discomfort, she might be disregarding his feelings. But she also states she's okay with not dancing if it's a problem, so maybe she's willing to compromise.\n\nAnother angle is the difference between public dance and a private, paid interaction. A lap dance is part of the strip club's service, while dancing at a bachelorette party could be more social and ambiguous. The boyfriend might feel that dancing with another guy, even without intent, is more intimate and could lead to misinterpretations. The author's stance is about mutual trust, but the boyfriend's reaction shows he doesn't see it the same way.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's comfort levels. Even if the author's logic is sound, the boyfriend's emotional response indicates that he feels hurt or disrespected. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but she could be misunderstanding his perspective. The fact that he was clearly upset suggests that her question crossed a line, even if she meant it as a genuine inquiry.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that she's not entirely in the wrong because she's trying to be fair and trusting, but she might not have considered his feelings deeply enough. However, since he already said no, and she continued to argue the point, that could be where she's in the wrong. Alternatively, if she was just asking and not planning to do it, maybe not. The line is blurry here. But since the boyfriend's feelings were hurt, and the author didn't back down despite his clear discomfort, she might be in the wrong for not respecting his boundaries even if she thinks her logic holds up.\n"
