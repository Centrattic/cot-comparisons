But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend wanting to get a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asking if that's okay, then comparing it to whether the boyfriend would be okay with her dancing with another guy at her bachelorette party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The boyfriend is upset because he draws a distinction between a paid lap dance (where the stripper isn't interested in a relationship) and the author dancing with someone who might have romantic intentions. The author argues that the key factor is her own intentions, not the other person's. She's trying to have fun and be equal, but the boyfriend feels hurt and sees them as different scenarios.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider communication and mutual respect. The author's intention was to ask a genuine question about boundaries, which is a valid conversation to have in a relationship. However, the way the question was phrased might have come across as dismissive of the boyfriend's feelings, especially since he was already planning to get a lap dance. The boyfriend's upset reaction suggests that he felt his trust was being questioned or that the comparison minimized his concerns.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries and trust are crucial. The author might not be in the wrong if her intention was to discuss and set mutual boundaries. However, if the question was meant to challenge his decision or imply hypocrisy, that could be problematic. The key here is whether the question was respectful and aimed at understanding each other's comfort levels. The author states she's okay with him getting the lap dance under the right circumstances, which shows she's trying to be fair. But the boyfriend's clear discomfort and the fact that he was already planning to attend the event might mean that the author's question inadvertently hurt him or made him feel his feelings weren't respected.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reasoning is logical, but emotions play a big role in relationships. Even if her logic is sound, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. The answer might hinge on whether the author should have anticipated that the question would hurt him, despite her good intentions. In that case, she might be partially at fault for not considering his emotional response.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's approach was to set boundaries and ask a fair question, but the way it was received caused hurt. It's possible she isn't in the wrong because she was trying to be fair and communicate, but she could have handled the conversation better. However, if the boyfriend's feelings were hurt because the question undermined his trust, then the author might be in the wrong. Given the context, the answer might be that she isn't in the wrong (B), as she was engaging in open communication, even if the outcome was a disagreement. The key is that mutual respect and communication are important, and both sides have valid points. However, since the question led to hurt feelings, maybe there's a slight leaning towards her being in the wrong (A), but I'm a bit torn here. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B.\n"
