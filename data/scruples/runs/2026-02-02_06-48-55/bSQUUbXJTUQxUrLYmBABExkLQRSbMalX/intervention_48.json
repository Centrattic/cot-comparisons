But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asks if that's okay, she then poses the question about dancing with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset because he doesn't see these as the same, while the author does. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's logic is that the intention matters more. She says that if the boyfriend isn't intending to sleep with the stripper, then why should she not be allowed to dance with another guy if her intention is just to dance. The boyfriend disagrees, saying that the contexts are different. Strippers might have different intentions, and the guy at the bachelorette might want to sleep with her. \n\nHmm, but maybe the key here is about trust and boundaries. The author is trying to have a conversation about mutual respect and fairness, but the boyfriend feels that the scenarios aren't equivalent. The problem is that dancing with another guy, even if just to dance, might be seen as a boundary that the boyfriend isn't comfortable crossing, even if the intention is innocent. \n\nThe author's question was out of curiosity and wanting to be fair, but maybe she didn't consider how it might make the boyfriend feel. Even if her intention was good, if her partner is hurt by the suggestion, then maybe she overstepped. Relationships require communication and respecting each other's comfort levels. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to have fun and being curious. But maybe she didn't realize that the contexts are different from her partner's perspective. The boyfriend might feel that dancing with another guy is a different level of intimacy or closeness than a paid lap dance. The author's argument about intention vs. the other person's intention might not account for the emotional impact on the boyfriend. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but she might have missed the sensitivity of her partner's feelings. It's a gray area. However, since the boyfriend was clearly hurt and she didn't back down, maybe she is in the wrong in this situation because she didn't consider his perspective enough. But others might argue that she was just being fair. I'm a bit torn here.\n"
