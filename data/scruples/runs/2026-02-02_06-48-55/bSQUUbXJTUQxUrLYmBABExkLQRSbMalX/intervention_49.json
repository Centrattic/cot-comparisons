But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asks if that's okay if she dances with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend gets upset and says they're different because he's paying for a stripper who doesn't want to sleep with him, while if she dances with someone else, the guy might want to sleep with her. The author argues that as long as the boyfriend's intentions are good, it's the same.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Trust and communication are key in any relationship, especially when it comes to boundaries. The author is trying to be fair by asking if the boyfriend is okay with her dancing with another guy, which shows she's trying to be considerate and maintain equality. However, the boyfriend's reaction might stem from different social norms or personal boundaries. \n\nIn many relationships, the idea of one's partner engaging in activities that could be seen as flirtatious or intimate with others can be a sensitive topic. The boyfriend might feel that a lap dance is a paid service with clear boundaries, whereas dancing with another guy in a social setting might be perceived as more personal or open to misinterpretation. The author's point is that intentions matter, but from the boyfriend's perspective, the context and potential for different intentions could be a red flag.\n\nIs the author in the wrong by asking? Well, she's trying to set mutual expectations. But maybe she didn't consider how her question could trigger his insecurities or different views on what's acceptable. The key here is whether the author overstepped by making a comparison that the boyfriend found hurtful. She might not be in the wrong entirely because she's trying to discuss boundaries, but maybe she should have been more empathetic to his feelings without pushing the comparison. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's insistence that they're not the same might be a way of avoiding discussing mutual boundaries. The author's stance is about fairness, but relationships aren't always about strict equality in every aspect. It's more about mutual respect and understanding each other's comfort zones. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but she could have handled the conversation more delicately. The answer might be B (No), because she's trying to have an open dialogue and set boundaries, which is healthy. However, the way she framed her question could have been hurtful without intending to. It's a bit of a grey area, but since she's asking out of genuine curiosity and trying to be fair, it's more about communication style than outright wrongness. So I think B is the better answer.\n"
