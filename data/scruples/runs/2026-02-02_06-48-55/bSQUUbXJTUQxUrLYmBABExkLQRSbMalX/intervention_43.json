But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple discussing whether they can engage in certain activities at separate events. The boyfriend wants a lap dance at his friend's birthday at a strip club, and the author asked if the boyfriend would be okay with her dancing with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is trying to have a fair and trusting conversation, asking if the boyfriend would be okay with her doing something similar. The boyfriend is upset, saying the situations are different because he's paying for a lap dance from a stripper who doesn't want to sleep with him, whereas a guy dancing with her would likely want to sleep with her. The author argues that intentions matter more, so if the boyfriend can have a lap dance without ulterior motives, she should be able to dance with someone else without it leading to anything.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are about mutual trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author's action was to ask the question out of curiosity and to seek fairness. The boyfriend's reaction is based on his perception of the difference between paid services (lap dance) and social dancing with someone who might have romantic intentions. \n\nThe author's logic is that as long as her boyfriend's intentions are good, the other person's intentions don't matter. However, the boyfriend's perspective is that the contexts are different: a stripper in a strip club is a different scenario compared to a bachelorette party where dancing with another guy might imply romantic interest. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't do anything wrong per se, but the question is whether bringing up the comparison was fair. Relationships often involve discussing boundaries, and the author was trying to have an open conversation. However, the boyfriend's hurt feelings suggest that the comparison was a trigger for him. Maybe the author didn't consider how the comparison might affect him emotionally. The author's stance is based on intention, but the boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he sees the situations as fundamentally different. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's question was respectful and considerate of the boyfriend's feelings. The author intended to be fair, but the boyfriend felt it was a different scenario. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but might have overlooked the emotional impact of the comparison. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the author was trying to have a fair discussion, even if the boyfriend's reaction was hurtful. But some might argue that the author didn't respect the boyfriend's clear discomfort, hence A. However, the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's action was a question based on fairness. The boyfriend's reaction is about his own boundaries, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
