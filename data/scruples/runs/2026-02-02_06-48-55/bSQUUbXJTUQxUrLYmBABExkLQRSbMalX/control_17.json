But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break it down.\n\nThe situation is about a couple discussing their plans for upcoming events. The boyfriend wants to go to a strip club and get a lap dance for his friend's birthday. The author, in turn, asks the boyfriend if he'd be okay with her dancing with another guy at her bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset and says it's different because strippers aren't interested in sleeping with him, whereas a guy she dances with might have such intentions. The author argues that the intentions of the other person don't matter as much as her boyfriend's intentions.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author overstepped by asking that question. The key here is about mutual respect and boundaries in a relationship. Both partners should have the right to express their boundaries. The author was trying to check if her boyfriend would be okay with her similar behavior, which is a reasonable thing to do to ensure mutual understanding and trust. However, the boyfriend felt hurt, which suggests that the question might have touched on a sensitive area for him. \n\nBut why? The author's question was framed as a genuine inquiry to compare their mutual boundaries. If the boyfriend had clear boundaries that he hasn't communicated before, that's on him. However, the author's question might have come across as challenging his comfort level. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to insecurity or different views on what's acceptable in a relationship. \n\nThe author's logic is that if the boyfriend's intentions are good (not wanting to sleep with the stripper), then her similar intentions (dancing without sleeping with another guy) should be acceptable. The boyfriend's argument is that the contexts are different because the other guy might have ulterior motives. \n\nIt's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because she was trying to ensure fairness and that her boyfriend respected her autonomy as much as she respected his. However, the way she asked the question might have been insensitive or brought up unspoken insecurities. But given that both partners are in a relationship, the expectation is that they should be able to discuss boundaries openly. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to communicate their comfort levels. The author's question was about mutual boundaries, which is a valid approach. The boyfriend's hurt feelings might stem from not having discussed these boundaries before. If he hadn't set those expectations clearly, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for asking. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. She was trying to have an open conversation about mutual respect and boundaries, which is healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction indicates he might have had unspoken boundaries, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for asking.\n"
