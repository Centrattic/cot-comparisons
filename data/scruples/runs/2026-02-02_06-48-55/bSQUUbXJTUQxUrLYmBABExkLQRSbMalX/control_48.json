But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and her boyfriend are discussing attending separate events. The boyfriend is going to a strip club where he might get a lap dance, and the author is going to a bachelorette party where she might dance with another guy. She asked her boyfriend if that's okay, comparing it to his getting a lap dance. He got upset, saying they're different because the stripper isn't interested in sleeping with him, while the guy she dances with might want to sleep with her. She argues that intentions matter, and if the guy she dances with doesn't have those intentions, then it's the same.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend's main issue seems to be about the perceived double standard. He might feel that dancing with another guy at a party could lead to something he's not comfortable with, even if she doesn't have the intention. He might also feel that lap dances are part of the strip club culture and are different because they're paid for and the dancer isn't interested in a relationship. On the other hand, the author thinks that as long as she and her boyfriend's intentions are clear, it's similar. She's not looking to sleep with someone else, so she doesn't see the difference.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author asked her boyfriend if it's okay, which is good. But her boyfriend's reaction suggests that he finds the comparison invalid and it hurt him. The author's logic is based on intentions, but maybe the boyfriend sees the contexts as different. In a strip club, the interaction is expected to be transactional, whereas dancing at a bachelorette party might carry different social implications. The boyfriend might fear that the guy she dances with could have ulterior motives, even if she doesn't. Trust is important, but boundaries also matter.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She raised a valid question and tried to understand his perspective. However, she might not have considered that her boyfriend's discomfort stems from different social norms and his own boundaries. Even if her intention is innocent, her boyfriend's feelings are valid. She might have pushed the comparison without fully respecting his feelings. So, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. The key is that both need to communicate better and respect each other's boundaries. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and she asked out of curiosity but didn't account for his feelings, maybe the answer is B (No), she's not in the wrong, but it's a situation where both could work on communication.\n"
