But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author (the woman) is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nShe's in a one-year relationship with her boyfriend, and they had a first fight about whether she dancing with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party is okay, compared to him getting a lap dance at his friend's birthday at a strip club. She asked him if he'd be okay with her dancing with a guy, and he wasn't. She argues that the key is their intentions. The boyfriend's point is that a lap dance is a paid service and the stripper's intent isn't to sleep with him, whereas another guy at a bachelorette party would likely have romantic intentions. She counters that she doesn't care about the other guy's intent, only her own, and that strippers might sleep with patrons too.\n\nThe main question is whether her asking this question makes her the asshole. Let's break it down. In relationships, communication and mutual understanding are important. She wanted to know if her actions would be okay, which is a valid question. Her reasoning is about intentions, which is a valid perspective. However, her boyfriend felt hurt and saw the situations as different. \n\nIs there a wrongdoing here? Well, she didn't do anything to hurt him intentionally. She asked a question to clarify boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from different values or past experiences. The key issue here is about differing views on what's acceptable in a relationship. Neither side is necessarily wrong, but the problem is more about differing expectations. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for asking a question and expressing her perspective. Relationships require negotiation, and this seems like a miscommunication rather than a clear wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
