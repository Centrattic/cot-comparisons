But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at his friend's strip club event. The author then asks if it's okay for her to dance with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset and says it's different because he's paying for a stripper who doesn't want to sleep with him, whereas the guy she dances with might have intentions. She argues that her intentions matter more.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The boyfriend feels that the two situations are fundamentally different because one involves a paid performer with no romantic interest, and the other involves a potential romantic competitor. The author sees it as similar because she's not looking for anything beyond dancing, and she's checking in with him out of trust.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by asking if dancing with another guy is okay. In relationships, communication is key. The author tried to be open and curious, which is good. However, the boyfriend's comfort level is important too. He might feel that dancing with another guy, even if it's just dancing, could be a step towards something else, especially if the guy has intentions. The author's logic is about mutual trust and intentions, but relationships often involve differing boundaries even if both parties have good intentions.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on the relationship dynamics. She didn't force anything and offered to not dance at all. She asked for his opinion, which is a responsible approach. The boyfriend's reaction is about his own insecurities or boundaries. The author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by asking, but maybe she didn't consider how he would feel. However, since she's trying to be fair and communicative, it's more about the boyfriend's feelings than her being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
