But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple discussing their boundaries at social events. The boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at his friend's birthday party, which is at a strip club. The author then asks if her boyfriend would be okay with her dancing with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset and says the two situations are different because a stripper is paid and not interested in sleeping with him, while the guy she dances with might have romantic intentions. The author argues that it's about the boyfriend's intentions, not the other person's.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together over a year, so there should be some established trust and communication. The author is trying to have an open discussion about boundaries, which is a healthy approach. She's not saying she'll definitely dance with someone else, just asking for his perspective. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is based on the idea that lap dances are a different context. In a strip club, the setup is different from a bachelorette party. At a strip club, the interaction is part of the environment where services are paid, and while strippers might have personal relationships with patrons, the primary context is professional. In a bachelorette party, dancing with another guy might be seen as more personal and could imply a level of intimacy that's not present in the strip club scenario. \n\nThe author's argument is about mutual trust and intentions. She's saying that if her boyfriend's intentions are pure (just a lap dance without romantic interest), then her dancing with someone else with pure intentions should be the same. However, relationships often have unspoken boundaries. What one person sees as equal, the other might not, due to the social contexts involved.\n\nIs the author wrong for questioning this? She's trying to understand and negotiate boundaries, which is fair. But maybe she didn't consider how her question might make her boyfriend feel. By comparing lap dances to dancing with someone else, she might be invalidating his feelings about what he's comfortable with. Even if her logic is sound, communication is key. They need to discuss their comfort levels and why certain activities in different settings are okay or not.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' feelings matter. If the boyfriend feels hurt, the author should acknowledge that and be open to discussing why the situations are different from his perspective. It's not just about being right or wrong, but about mutual respect and understanding. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking, but she might need to approach the conversation differently to consider her boyfriend's feelings more.\n"
