But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at his friend's birthday at a strip club, and the author (girlfriend) asks if it's okay if she dances with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset, saying they're not the same, while the author thinks the intentions are what matter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend is going to a strip club, which is a context where lap dances are a common part of the experience, even if he pays for it and the strippers aren't necessarily interested in sleeping with him. The author, on the other hand, is suggesting dancing with another guy at a bachelorette party. The key point is the difference in context and the perceived double standard.\n\nThe author's argument is that as long as her intentions are pure (just dancing), it's okay. However, the boyfriend feels hurt because he sees the situations as different. In a strip club, the lap dance is a paid service, and the main issue is the physical intimacy involved. Dancing with another guy in a club setting, even if just for fun, might involve more personal space and could be seen as more intimate, especially if the guy has other intentions. The boyfriend's concern about the guy wanting to sleep with her adds another layer of trust and safety issues.\n\nCommunication is crucial here. The author's question was out of genuine curiosity, but it might have come across as challenging the boyfriend's boundaries. The boyfriend's hurt feelings indicate that he feels the situations aren't equivalent, which is valid. The author might not realize that even if her intentions are good, the scenario could be more vulnerable to misinterpretation or potential risks compared to a paid lap dance in a controlled environment.\n\nSo, while the author's intent was to discuss mutual boundaries, the way she framed the question might have overlooked her boyfriend's specific concerns about the different contexts and potential for different outcomes. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not fully considering his perspective and the differences in the situations.\n"
