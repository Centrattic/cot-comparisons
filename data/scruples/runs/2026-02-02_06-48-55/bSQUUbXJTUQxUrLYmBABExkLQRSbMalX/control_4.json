But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a couple discussing attending different events. The boyfriend wants to get a lap dance at his friend's birthday at a strip club. The author then asks if it's okay for her to dance with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset about that comparison.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasoning is that if the boyfriend is okay with a lap dance (which might involve a stripper wanting to sleep with him), then why isn't it okay for her to dance with a guy who might want to sleep with her? She's focusing on her boyfriend's intentions rather than the other person's. The boyfriend, on the other hand, sees the situations as different because he's paying for the lap dance and the stripper isn't interested in him, whereas a guy at a bachelorette party might be trying to get with her.\n\nThe key here is about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The author is trying to be fair and wants to have fun, but she's also setting boundaries. The boyfriend's discomfort comes from the perceived double standard. He might feel that dancing with another guy is more personal and potentially leading to emotional or physical connection, whereas a lap dance is a paid service. The author's logic is that the intention matters, not the other person's. But relationships often rely on both partners feeling comfortable and respected.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she asked a question to explore boundaries, which is fair. However, the boyfriend's reaction shows that he felt hurt, which might mean she didn't consider his perspective enough. The act of comparing the two situations might have triggered his insecurities. Even if her intention was to be fair, the way she approached it might have been insensitive. Therefore, while both have valid points, the author might have overstepped by not considering how her question would affect her boyfriend emotionally.\n"
