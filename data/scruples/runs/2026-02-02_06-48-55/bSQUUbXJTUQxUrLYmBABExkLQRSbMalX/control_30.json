But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple discussing whether it's okay for each to engage in certain activities at separate events. The boyfriend is going to a strip club and might get a lap dance, while the author is going to a bachelorette party and is considering dancing with another guy. The author asked if that's okay, and the boyfriend got upset. Now the author is questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, so asking questions about each other's comfort is normal. The author's intention was to check boundaries, which is valid. However, the boyfriend felt hurt, which suggests that maybe the way the question was framed or the context in which it was asked might have been sensitive.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument hinges on the difference between paid lap dances and dancing with someone who might have romantic intentions. He might see the lap dance as a transactional act without emotional investment, whereas dancing with another guy could imply a personal connection. The author counters that intentions matter more than the setting. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author's logic is sound, the boyfriend's feelings are valid. In relationships, how each person feels about certain things matters. The author might not have considered that bringing up dancing with another guy could trigger insecurities, especially when the boyfriend is already planning to engage in an activity that the author is comfortable with. It's possible the author's question came off as a challenge to his boundaries, even if that wasn't the intent.\n\nSo, while the author's curiosity is understandable, they might not have fully considered the emotional impact on their partner. The key here is mutual respect for boundaries. The author might not be entirely wrong, but they could have approached the conversation with more sensitivity to their boyfriend's feelings. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the boyfriend was clearly hurt, the author might share some responsibility in how the question was presented.\n"
