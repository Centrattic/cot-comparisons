But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend if it's okay for her to dance with another guy, comparing it to him getting a lap dance at a strip club. The boyfriend is upset, thinking the situations are different because strippers might have different intentions. The author argues that intentions matter, not the other person's desires.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The key point is about mutual trust and boundaries. The author is trying to establish equality by comparing both scenarios, but the boyfriend feels it's not fair because the contexts are different. The fact that he's hurt indicates that the situation is emotionally significant to him.\n\nCommunication is crucial here. The author's question was out of curiosity and wanting to be fair, but it might have overlooked the emotional impact of the comparison. The boyfriend's reaction suggests that he views lap dances as a different category, perhaps more about the setting and the nature of the interaction. Strippers might be in a professional environment, while dancing with someone at a bachelorette party could be seen as more personal or potentially flirtatious.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to gauge mutual trust and fairness. They also mentioned they don't need to dance, which shows they're open to not doing it if it's a problem. The boyfriend's insistence that they're not the same might stem from his own discomfort or past experiences, but the author's stance is about mutual respect based on intentions.\n\nIn relationships, what one person finds acceptable might not be for the other, and that's okay. The issue here is whether the author overstepped by making a direct comparison that the boyfriend found hurtful. The author tried to have an open discussion, which is good, but maybe didn't anticipate the emotional weight the comparison carried for her boyfriend. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because she was seeking clarity and trying to be fair, but it's also possible she didn't consider the emotional aspect enough. However, since she's willing to not dance if it's an issue, maybe the core of the problem is more about his interpretation rather than her actions. So, balancing both perspectives, I think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because she was trying to be fair and open, even if the comparison caused hurt feelings.\n"
