But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves their boyfriend wanting to get a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asking if it's okay for them to dance with another guy at their friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset, thinking it's different because strippers might have different intentions, while the author thinks intentions matter more.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The key point is the difference in perspective between the two. The author is trying to see if their boyfriend is okay with them dancing with another guy, drawing a parallel to the lap dance. The boyfriend feels it's not the same because the context and potential intentions differ. \n\nThe author's logic is that if they don't intend to sleep with someone, then the other person's intentions shouldn't matter. But the boyfriend is upset, feeling that the situations are inherently different. The author might not realize that the emotional weight and trust aspects are different. In a strip club, the lap dance is a paid service, whereas dancing with someone at a party could be seen as more personal and potentially leading to something else. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, asking the question is not inherently wrong, but maybe the way they framed it was dismissive of their boyfriend's feelings. The author might not have considered that their question could be perceived as testing boundaries or lacking trust. The boyfriend's hurt feelings suggest that the author's approach might have been insensitive. \n\nAlso, the author's stance might not account for the difference in social contexts. The bachelorette party dancing could be more about personal interaction, while a strip club lap dance is a transactional act. The author's comparison might not hold in the boyfriend's view, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of emotional intelligence, the author could have approached the situation differently, perhaps by acknowledging their boyfriend's perspective first before expressing their own. The fact that the boyfriend felt hurt even though the author wasn't planning to dance with someone else might indicate that the author didn't consider the emotional impact of their question. \n\nSo, while the author has valid points about intentions, their approach might have been wrong in how it was communicated, leading to hurt feelings. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their boyfriend's feelings and the context of the situations adequately.\n"
