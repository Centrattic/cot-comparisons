But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend wanting to get a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asking if it's okay if she dances with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset about the comparison, feeling it's not the same because he's paying for the lap dance and the stripper isn't interested in sleeping with him, whereas the guy at the bachelorette party would be. The author argues that the intentions matter\u2014she doesn't care about the other person's intentions as long as her boyfriend's are good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication is key here. The author approached the question with genuine curiosity, aiming to understand her boyfriend's perspective. She's trying to establish boundaries and ensure mutual respect. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that dancing with another guy, even if just for fun, is a boundary he doesn't want crossed, whereas a lap dance in a strip club is a different context for him. This could be about jealousy or differing views on what's acceptable in their relationship.\n\nThe author's logic is that if her intentions are pure, then the other person's intentions shouldn't matter. However, the boyfriend's perspective is that the contexts are fundamentally different: a paid service in a strip club vs. a potentially flirtatious dance at a bachelorette party. His hurt feelings suggest that the comparison upset him because he might see the dancing scenario as more personal or risky for their relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she asked a question to explore boundaries and ensure mutual understanding. That's a healthy communication step. However, she might not have considered how the comparison could be perceived. Maybe her boyfriend felt that the question implied she was more okay with him getting a lap dance than her dancing with someone else, which could be seen as a double standard. The key here is whether the question was meant to challenge his boundaries or understand them better. Since she says it was out of genuine curiosity, she's not in the wrong for asking. However, she might need to acknowledge his feelings and clarify that she respects his boundaries even if she doesn't fully agree.\n\nIn relationships, differences in perspectives are common. The issue isn't necessarily about right or wrong but about navigating each other's feelings and finding a compromise. Since the author is open to not dancing if it's an issue, she's showing willingness to compromise. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for raising the question, but she might need to be more sensitive to his feelings in future discussions.\n"
