But we had our first kind-of fight the other day, and I'm not sure if I was being the asshole in this situation. \n\nWe have some separate events coming up, it's his friends birthday in a few weeks and it's my friends bachelorette party next month. We were talking a bit about it and his friend's party will involve visiting a strip club, so the topic of my boyfriend getting a lap dance came up.\n\nI want my boyfriend to enjoy himself and have fun, and I also want to be trusting and fair. I also want to have some fun myself. \n\nI would be fine with him getting a lap dance under the right circumstances. So I asked, out of genuine curiosity, if he would be okay with me dancing with another guy when my friends and I go dancing at the bachelorette party. \n\nHe became kind of upset and was clear about him not being okay with it. \n\nSo I asked how would that really be any different from you getting a lap dance?\n\nHis logic was that they're two entirely different things, he's paying for someone to give him a lap dance, and the stripper doesn't want to sleep with him, while the guy I would be dancing with would almost certainly want to sleep with me. \n\nMy logic is that I don't care what the other person's intentions are, I care about your intentions. It's not unheard of for strippers to sleep with patrons, but if I know he doesn't want to or have the intention of doing so, I couldn't give a shit if the stripper wanted to sleep with him. And I feel that it should be the same with my situation, sure the guy may have intentions, but I would have zero desire or intention of doing anything other than dancing. \n\nI'm totally happy not to dance with anyone at all, I don't need to dance with someone else to have a good time, but my boyfriend says lap dances are \"just what happen at strip clubs\".\n\nHe also kept insisting that they're not the same thing, and was clearly hurt that I would even suggest such a thing. So now I partially feel like a grade A+ asshole, but I still also stand by my logic. ATIA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend wanting to get a lap dance at a strip club, and the author asking if it's okay if she dances with another guy at her friend's bachelorette party. The boyfriend is upset and says that's different because the stripper might want to sleep with him, but the author thinks intentions matter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to be fair, asking if the situation is comparable. She wants to understand why her action is different from her boyfriend's. But her boyfriend is hurt that she even questioned the comparison, which suggests he might feel like she's not respecting his boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. In a relationship, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The author is pointing out that the intention matters, not just the action. However, her boyfriend sees the lap dance as a paid service where the intention isn't romantic, whereas dancing with another guy might imply interest or lead to something else. \n\nThe author's question could be seen as a way to test her boyfriend's boundaries and her own. But the way she presented the question might have come off as dismissive of his feelings. Even if her logic is sound, if she's asking it in a way that challenges his trust in the relationship, that could be the issue. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is trying to have autonomy in her social events, but the boyfriend might feel that dancing with another guy at a bachelorette party is different due to the context. Bachelorette parties often involve more casual interactions, but the boyfriend's discomfort is valid if he feels it's a red line for him.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if she's genuinely trying to understand his perspective, but if her question was meant to push boundaries or test his trust, that's different. Since she states she's okay not dancing, but still asked the question out of curiosity, it's about whether the comparison was fair.\n\nIn relationships, sometimes even well-meaning questions can hurt if they touch on sensitive areas. The boyfriend's hurt feelings indicate that the question might have crossed a line, even if logically the author sees it as a fair comparison. So the answer might hinge on whether the author should have considered the emotional impact before asking the comparison.\n"
