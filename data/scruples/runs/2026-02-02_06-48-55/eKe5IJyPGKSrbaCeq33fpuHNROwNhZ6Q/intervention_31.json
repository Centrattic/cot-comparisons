Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who now has reactive attachment disorder, causing a lot of behavioral issues. The child is acting out physically and emotionally, and the parents have tried various methods but nothing's working. The author feels exhausted and is considering giving the child back.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects here. Adoption is a legal process that forms a permanent family bond, even if it's not biological. So in most places, once a child is legally adopted, returning them isn't as simple as returning a product. There might be legal procedures involved, like termination of adoption, which can be complicated and often requires showing that the child is in danger or that the adoption is not in their best interest. \n\nThen, there's the emotional aspect. The parents have invested a lot of time, energy, and love into this child. The child has attachment issues, which might make it hard for him to form bonds. The parents are experiencing physical and emotional abuse from the child, which is a serious issue. The mother is being physically harmed by her own child, which is traumatic. \n\nEthically, the parents' well-being is important too. They're emotionally and physically exhausted. But the child's well-being is also a factor. If they decide to return the child, where will he go? Are there better resources or placements for him? Maybe there are specialized institutions or foster care that can provide the necessary support. \n\nAnother angle: the parents' intention. They adopted because they wanted to help an unwanted child, which is a selfless act. Now they're considering giving the child back because they can't handle it anymore. That could be seen as a failure of commitment, but it's also a realistic response to a very difficult situation. They tried everything, including therapy, but nothing's working long-term. \n\nBut is it wrong to feel that way? The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents are in a tough spot. They might feel guilty or selfish, but realistically, they need to consider their own mental health and safety. If the child is in danger or if the parents are unable to provide a safe environment, then it might be necessary to seek alternative placements. However, the process is not straightforward and should involve professional guidance. \n\nThe key here is whether the parents have exhausted all possible avenues before considering returning the child. They mentioned therapy, various parenting strategies, and consulting forums. They might need to explore more specialized care, maybe residential treatment programs or other resources. But if those aren't available, then it's a different story. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're considering giving the child back because they can't handle it anymore, but there's no immediate danger to the child, maybe there's a responsibility to try harder. However, if the situation is affecting the parents' well-being and the child's safety, then it might be a necessary step. The answer depends on the circumstances. But given the information, the parents have tried their best, and the child's disorder is a medical condition that affects bonding. The parents' decision isn't necessarily wrong if they're acting in the best interest of both the child and themselves. So I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
