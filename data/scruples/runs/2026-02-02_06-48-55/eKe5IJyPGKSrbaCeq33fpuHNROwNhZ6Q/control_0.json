Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The child has severe behavioral issues, including violence towards the parents and others, and has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. The parents have tried various methods and therapy, but the problems persist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who is now 6. He has a history of violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and has harmed others. The parents are physically and emotionally exhausted. They're considering giving him back but feel conflicted because they've done everything they can. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether their intention to give the child back makes them the asshole. \n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional attachments. It's challenging to manage, even with professional help. The parents have tried multiple approaches\u2014firmness, therapy, etc.\u2014but the child's behavior hasn't improved at home or school. The child's actions are dangerous and harmful, leading to potential expulsion and safety concerns.\n\nThe parents are not choosing to give the child up lightly. They mention their exhaustion and the fact that they've explored all options. The child's behavior poses risks to others and themselves. It's important to consider the well-being of the child as well. If the current environment is too stressful and the parents can't provide the necessary care, maybe it's in the child's best interest to be placed in a more suitable environment that can handle his needs. \n\nHowever, the parents have a deep emotional investment and have done everything possible. They might feel failure, but their intention is to protect the child, not abandon him. The key is whether they are acting in the child's best interest despite their own pain. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often evaluates intentions and circumstances. If the parents are making a tough decision based on the child's welfare and their inability to cope, they might not be in the wrong. On the other hand, if they're giving up without trying enough, that's different. But in this case, they've tried extensively. \n\nAlso, the child's diagnosis complicates things. RAD is hard to manage, and the parents might not have the resources or support to continue. It's a tough call, but given the circumstances, the parents' decision isn't necessarily selfish. They're prioritizing the child's safety and possibly a better future, even though it's emotionally painful. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're making a difficult choice based on the child's needs and their own limitations.\n"
