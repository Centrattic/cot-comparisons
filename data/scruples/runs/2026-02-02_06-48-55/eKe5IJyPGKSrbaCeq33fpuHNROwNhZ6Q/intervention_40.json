Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and her husband adopted a child from Haiti. The kid is now six, and they've had a tough time with his behavior\u2014tantrums, violence, etc. They've tried various methods, therapy, but he's been aggressive towards them and others. He has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to treat. The author is considering giving him back because she's exhausted and can't handle it anymore.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, adoption is a big commitment, and they chose it knowing there might be challenges. Reactive attachment disorder is serious, and the kids can be difficult. But they've already invested a lot of time and resources. However, if the child is causing harm, maybe it's in his best interest to be in a better environment? Or maybe they should try more options before giving up?\n\nI remember that RAD often requires specialized care. Maybe they haven't explored all possibilities. But also, the parents' well-being is important. If they're being physically abused, it's a safety issue. The author is clearly struggling, but is giving him back the wrong decision?\n\nSome might say they should have known about the challenges before adopting. Others might argue that it's better to place him where he can get more help if they can't manage. However, giving up might not be the right choice if there are no other options. The answer might depend on whether they've exhausted all possible supports.\n\nI think the key points are the safety of the parents, the child's well-being, and whether all options have been tried. Since the parents are being physically hurt and the child is at risk of expulsion, maybe it's not the wrong decision to consider returning him. But the answer is A or B. The user originally thought the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. \n\nIn AITA posts, often the community supports the person if they've tried their best. But in this case, the parents have tried therapy, different approaches. The child's behavior is extreme. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if they could do more, maybe A. But considering the resources they've used and the situation, B seems possible. I think the answer is B.\n"
