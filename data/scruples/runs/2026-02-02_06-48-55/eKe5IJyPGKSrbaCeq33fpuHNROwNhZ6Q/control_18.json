Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple decided to adopt after the woman's infertility. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti. The child has significant behavioral issues, including violent tantrums, aggression towards others, and even physical abuse towards the mother. They've tried various approaches, therapy, discipline, etc., with some temporary improvement. The child has reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is hard to treat. The mother is exhausted and considering returning the child.\n\nNow, the key points here are the child's well-being and the parents' responsibilities. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but the parents are facing extreme challenges. The child is harming himself and others, which is a serious concern. The parents have sought help, but the situation isn't improving enough. \n\nEthically, the parents have a duty to protect the child and others from harm. If the child is at risk of being expelled from school and has a history of violence, it might be in his best interest to be in a more equipped environment. Also, the parents' safety and mental health are important. They can't provide a stable home if they're being physically harmed and emotionally drained.\n\nHowever, adoption agencies typically require extensive counseling before termination. The parents need to ensure all other options are exhausted. But given the severity of the situation, it might be considered a responsible decision to seek help through the adoption process again, especially if the child's needs exceed their capacity. The mother isn't being negligent; she's overwhelmed and looking for a solution that ensures everyone's safety.\n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're making a tough call under difficult circumstances, prioritizing safety and well-being despite the emotional struggle.\n"
