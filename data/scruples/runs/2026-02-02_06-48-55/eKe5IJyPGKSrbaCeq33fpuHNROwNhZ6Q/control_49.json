Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation involves a child with behavioral issues and a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder (RAD). The author has tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement\u2014but the child's behavior is escalating, leading to physical aggression towards the parents. The author is emotionally and physically exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, adoptive parents have the right to seek to terminate the adoption, but it's a complex process. However, the question isn't about legality but whether the author is morally or ethically in the wrong.\n\nEthically, adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also a two-way relationship. The child's well-being is crucial, and if the parents are in a situation where they can't provide a safe environment, perhaps it's in the child's best interest to find another home. However, the parents have already made significant efforts with therapy and other interventions. But if those aren't working, and the child is being harmed by the environment, maybe the parents are right to consider a change.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that giving up could be seen as abandoning the child, especially since he has attachment issues. They might believe the parents should try even more resources or support before considering termination. But the parents have already tried multiple approaches, and the situation is deteriorating. The child's actions are not only harmful to the parents but also to others, like the teacher and other children. This could indicate that the parents aren't able to manage the child's behavior effectively, which could be a risk to his safety and others'.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that affects the child's ability to form healthy relationships. If the parents feel that their efforts aren't working and that they're being physically harmed, it's understandable that they're considering giving him back. It's also about their own well-being; if they're exhausted and unable to function, it's not a sustainable situation for anyone involved.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've made a commitment to provide the best care possible, but the circumstances have become overwhelming. The key factors are the child's well-being, the parents' ability to care for him safely, and the possibility that another environment might be better for everyone. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
