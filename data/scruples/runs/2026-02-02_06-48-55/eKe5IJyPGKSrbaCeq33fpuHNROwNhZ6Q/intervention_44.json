Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the adoptive parents went through a tough journey to adopt a child from Haiti when the mother is infertile. They've tried various methods to handle the child's behavior\u2014therapy, different parenting approaches, but the child has reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is hard to treat. The child is causing physical harm to the parents and others, and is at risk of school expulsion. The parents are exhausted and considering giving him back.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for considering this. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but if the child's behavior is harmful and unmanageable despite all efforts, is it wrong to consider returning them? The parents are trying their best but are overwhelmed. The child has a disorder that makes bonding difficult, and the situation is dangerous. \n\nFrom a compassionate standpoint, the parents' well-being is also important. No one should be expected to endure physical abuse. However, there's a sense of responsibility towards the child. But if they can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's in the child's best interest as well to find a better fit. \n\nBut some might argue that once adopted, you must keep the child regardless of challenges. Others might say the parents have done everything and it's not their fault. So, is the author in the wrong? \n\nHmm. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they've tried everything and the situation is beyond their control. The child's issues aren't their fault, and they're suffering. But there's also the aspect of commitment. However, considering the danger and the disorder's impact, B seems more appropriate.\n"
