Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is complicated. The parents went through adoption, expecting challenges, but the child has reactive attachment disorder and is causing significant issues at home and school. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, but the child's behavior is extreme and harmful.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and returning a child might involve legal steps. But the question is about moral wrongness, not legal. The parents are considering returning the child because of the child's behavior, which is affecting their well-being. They mention feeling exhausted and physically harmed.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where the child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. The parents have tried everything, so it's not like they're neglecting the child. They love him but can't manage the current situation. The key points here are the child's well-being and the parents' capacity to care for him.\n\nSome might argue that the parents should not give him up because they have a responsibility as adoptive parents. But others might say that the child's needs are too overwhelming and that he might thrive better in another environment. Also, the child's safety and the parents' mental health are factors. If the parents are at risk of being harmed, it's a valid concern.\n\nThe author isn't acting out of selfishness but from a place of exhaustion and inability to provide a safe environment. They've consulted professionals and parenting resources, which shows they've made a conscious effort. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the situation is beyond their control, and they're making a tough decision for the child's and their own well-being.\n"
