Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and their husband tried to have children but faced infertility. They considered IVF but couldn't due to the author's medical issues. Then they considered surrogacy but decided on adoption because there are many unwanted children. They adopted a three-year-old boy from Haiti, now six. The child has been violent and destructive, with tantrums, aggression at home and school, and even physically harmed the parents. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. They've tried various methods, therapy, but it's not lasting. The author is considering giving the child back despite feeling guilty.\n\nNow, the question is if they're in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate. \n\nFirst, adoption is a big commitment, and the parents made the choice with the intention of providing a home. They've tried everything\u2014therapy, discipline methods. The child's behavior is extreme and potentially dangerous. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that affects the child's ability to form healthy attachments. It's mentioned that even in therapy, he behaves better, but not at home or school. The parents have been physically harmed multiple times. \n\nLegally, maybe they can return the child if there's a valid reason, but emotionally and ethically, it's complex. Parents have a duty of care, but if the child is a danger to themselves and others, maybe it's necessary. However, adoption is meant to be permanent, so considering giving back might be seen as breaking that commitment. On the other hand, the parents' well-being and safety matter too. \n\nThe author is struggling with guilt, thinking that good people wouldn't consider this. It's possible that they feel like they've failed, but given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. Also, the child's needs might require specialized care they can't provide. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they give the child back, does that make them bad? Or are they making a difficult decision for everyone's safety and well-being? Different perspectives: some might say they should have known adoption could be challenging, others might say they did their best and it's not their fault. \n\nReactive attachment disorder is a factor here. It's not the child's fault, but they might need more resources than the parents can offer. The parents might not be equipped to handle it long-term, leading to the decision to return him. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they've made a compassionate choice despite the challenges, prioritizing safety and considering the child's needs. However, others might argue they should stick it out. But given the severity of the situation, it's a tough call. The key points are the child's diagnosis, the parents' efforts, and the safety concerns.\n"
