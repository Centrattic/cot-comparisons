Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The author is considering giving back their adopted son due to severe behavioral issues. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple adopted a child from Haiti when the mother was infertile. The child, now six, has been exhibiting violent and destructive behavior since they adopted him. They've tried various parenting strategies, therapy, and the child has been in therapy for a year and a half. The child has a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, which can't be cured. The parents are experiencing physical abuse from the child, including punches, kicks, etc. The author feels overwhelmed and is considering giving the child back, but is conflicted about it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider the ethical and practical aspects. Adopting a child with known or potential issues is a significant commitment. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that can be very challenging for parents. The parents have tried multiple approaches, and the child's behavior is affecting their well-being and the child's education (risk of expulsion). The author mentions being emotionally and physically exhausted. \n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong for considering returning the child. Legally, in many cases, once a child is adopted, the parents have full custody unless there's a legal reason for removal. However, the parents are not in a situation where they are harming the child or neglecting it. They are trying to provide care and support, but the child's behavior is beyond their control. \n\nEthically, the parents have a responsibility to the child's well-being as well. If they can't provide a safe environment, it might be in the child's best interest to find another home. However, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and some might argue that giving up could be seen as not fulfilling that commitment. \n\nBut given the severity of the situation, the parents are doing everything they can, and it's still not working. The child's behavior is dangerous, and the parents are at risk of physical harm. The author is considering this out of concern for their own and the child's safety and well-being. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at the situation with empathy. If the parents are making a decision based on their own safety and the child's potential for a better home, it's often seen as justified. However, some might argue that they should have known about the challenges before adopting. But in this case, the adoption was likely through proper channels, and reactive attachment disorder might not have been fully apparent at the time. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the parents are in a desperate situation where their well-being and the child's well-being are compromised. They are acting in the child's interest if they can no longer provide a safe home. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
