Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation involves a child they adopted from Haiti at three years old, now six. The child has been acting out with violent behavior at home and school, despite therapy and various parenting strategies. The parents have tried everything but are being physically harmed and emotionally drained. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The author is considering giving him back but feels guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but situations can change. The key points here are the child's diagnosed disorder, the severity of the behavior, the parents' efforts to address it, and their well-being. Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has trouble forming emotional connections, leading to behavioral issues. The parents have tried therapy, discipline methods, and even professional help, but the child's behavior persists, endangering their safety and quality of life.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering returning the child. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nEthically, adoption is a legal and binding process, so giving a child back isn't straightforward. However, the parents' rights and responsibilities must be weighed against the child's needs. The parents are also humans with their own health and safety to consider. If the child's behavior is causing physical harm and the parents are unable to provide a safe environment despite their best efforts, it's possible that the decision to seek another placement could be seen as in the child's best interest as well. However, some might argue that the parents are abandoning the child, especially since he's already in the system and might struggle in another home. \n\nBut given the severity of the situation\u2014physical abuse, risk of expulsion from school, and the parents' exhaustion\u2014it's a complex case. The parents have tried everything, and RAD is a challenging disorder. The author is seeking validation for a difficult decision. The key here is whether the decision is in the child's best interest and the parents' ability to care for him safely. If they can't provide a safe environment, it might not be in the child's best interest to stay, but if there's no other option, maybe they should try harder. However, the parents have already exhausted all options. \n\nIn many cases, when a child is adopted and the situation becomes unmanageable, professionals might suggest alternative care arrangements. So, while the parents might feel guilty, they aren't necessarily in the wrong if they're making the decision to protect their well-being and ensure the child can receive care elsewhere. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because they're considering the child's and their own welfare after exhausting all possible solutions.\n"
