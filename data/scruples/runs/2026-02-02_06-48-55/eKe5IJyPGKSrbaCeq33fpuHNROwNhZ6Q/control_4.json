Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who's now six, but he has been acting out with violent behavior, causing destruction, and even physical abuse towards the mother. He has Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which is mentioned as not curable. They've tried various methods\u2014therapy, different parenting approaches\u2014but the child's behavior is getting worse, leading to school issues and physical harm to the parent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The parents adopted a child in need, which was a selfless act. They've faced significant challenges, including the child's behavioral issues that are beyond their control. The child has a diagnosed disorder that affects his ability to form attachments, leading to the described behaviors. The parents are exhausted and considering giving the child back, not out of malice, but due to their own well-being and inability to manage the situation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the context. The parents didn't adopt the child to abandon him; they did it out of a sense of responsibility and to provide a home. However, the child's needs are extreme, and the parents might be at their breaking point. The key factors here are the child's medical diagnosis, the parents' efforts, and the impact on their safety and mental health.\n\nReactive Attachment Disorder is a serious condition. It's not something the parents can just \"fix\" with more effort. The parents have tried therapy, different parenting techniques, and the child's behavior is so severe that even after therapy, relapses happen. The mother has been physically harmed, which is a critical point. No parent should be in a situation where their child is endangering their safety. \n\nIn such cases, the well-being of the parents is also important. The question is whether the author is wrong for considering giving the child back. Legally and ethically, parents have a responsibility to ensure the child's safety, but also their own. If the parents can no longer provide a safe environment, they have a duty to seek alternative care. This isn't abandonment; it's a difficult decision made in the best interest of the child and the parents.\n\nHowever, there might be arguments that the parents should not give the child back because he needs stability and a home. But given the severity of the situation, including physical abuse and the risk of expulsion from school, continuing the adoption might not be in the child's best interest either if the parents can no longer manage his needs. The parents might be in a position where they can't provide the necessary care, leading to potential neglect or further harm.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parents are not in the wrong. They've made a selfless choice to adopt, but the circumstances have become unmanageable. The author is facing an impossible situation where their well-being is compromised. The answer should be B (No), as the author is not in the wrong for considering returning the child under these circumstances.\n"
