Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents went through a lot to adopt a child from Haiti, and the child has significant behavioral issues. He's been violent, destructive, and even hurt others. The parents have tried everything\u2014therapy, different parenting approaches, but it's not working. They're exhausted and considering giving him back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. On one hand, the parents made a commitment to adopt, and giving up might seem like they're not fulfilling that commitment. They might feel like they're abandoning the child, which could be seen as selfish. On the other hand, the child has reactive attachment disorder, which is a serious condition. The parents are experiencing physical abuse and emotional distress. Their well-being and safety are also important.\n\nAdoption is a lifelong commitment, but the parents might not have anticipated the severity of the child's issues. The child's behavior is so extreme that it's affecting the whole family and the child's own safety in school. The parents are seeking help and have tried everything, but it's not working. In such cases, sometimes the best decision for the child's future might involve a different placement where he can get the specialized care he needs. The parents might be in a position where they can't provide the necessary support anymore.\n\nHowever, some might argue that giving up could leave the child in a worse situation. They might believe the parents should keep trying or seek more specialized help. But the parents say they've tried everything and are at their breaking point. There's also the aspect of the child's own well-being\u2014being in a home where he's causing harm and not feeling connected might not be healthy for him either.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between the child's needs and the parents' capacity to meet them. The parents are under immense stress and are considering their options out of necessity, not malice. They've done what they could and now feel it's in everyone's best interest to seek another solution. So, I think the parents aren't in the wrong. It's a heartbreaking situation, but they're prioritizing the child's and their own well-being.\n"
