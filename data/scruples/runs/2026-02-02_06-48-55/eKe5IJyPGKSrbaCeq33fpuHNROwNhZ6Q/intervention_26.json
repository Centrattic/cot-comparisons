Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The child has a lot of behavioral issues, including violence, destruction, and emotional detachment. The parents have tried various approaches, therapy, and even the school is involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal commitment, but does that mean the parents are obligated to keep the child regardless of the circumstances? There might be legal processes for returning an adopted child, especially if the child was adopted internationally. In Haiti, maybe there are specific procedures, but generally, adoption is a lifelong commitment unless there's some legal redress. However, if the child has special needs or disorders like Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), the parents might have been informed beforehand. The user mentioned that the child was adopted from Haiti when he was three, so maybe the parents knew about potential behavioral challenges, or maybe they didn't. That's a point to consider.\n\nEmotionally, the parents are clearly struggling. They've been through a lot\u2014infertility, adoption process, dealing with a difficult child. They've tried multiple methods, therapy, etc., but the child's behavior is harmful and persistent. The mother has been physically assaulted by the child. That's a serious concern. The key question is whether they're in the wrong for considering returning the child. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the parents have a responsibility to the child's well-being and their own safety. If the child is endangering the parents or himself, maybe seeking help through the legal system or other resources is necessary. However, adoption is a big commitment, and giving up a child might be seen as abandoning them, especially if they have special needs. But if the parents are in danger and have exhausted all possible resources, maybe it's a difficult but necessary decision. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. The user might think that once you adopt a child, you can't give up, especially if the child has challenges. But others might argue that the parents' safety and mental health are also important. The child's well-being is also a factor\u2014maybe placing him in a more appropriate facility could be better. \n\nLegally, in some cases, if a child is causing harm, the parents might have to go through the court system to place the child in a different setting, which is different from just giving him back. The parents might not have the right to return the child without legal processes. If they do so without proper steps, they might be in the wrong. But if they're following the correct procedures, maybe not.\n\nReactive Attachment Disorder is a real thing, and without proper treatment, it's challenging. The parents have been to therapy, but maybe more specialized care is needed. The parents might need to seek out more resources, not just give up. However, if all options have been exhausted and it's a dangerous situation, then maybe they're justified. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. The parents are in a tough spot. Legally and ethically, they need to ensure they're following the right procedures. If they're considering returning the child without legal steps, that might be problematic. But if they're seeking legal help to rehome him in a better environment, that's different. The question is whether the parents are in the wrong for wanting to give him back. If they're not following the proper legal channels, then yes, they might be in the wrong. If they are, maybe not. The post doesn't specify their exact actions beyond considering it. \n\nGiven the information, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether they're acting legally and ethically. Since the post is about considering giving back, the answer might be that they're not in the wrong for considering it, but they need to take the right steps. However, the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they haven't actually returned the child yet, it's about their intent and the situation. \n\nIn many cases, people might argue that the parents have a duty to the child, but their safety is also important. So the answer could be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're in a situation where they've tried everything and are struggling, so considering returning the child isn't necessarily wrong. However, the answer might depend on cultural or personal views on adoption. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider all angles. The parents have a responsibility, but if the child is dangerous, maybe they need to find another solution. The answer could be B.\n"
