Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The couple adopted a child from Haiti who's now six and has a lot of behavioral issues, including violence and destructive behavior. They've tried various methods, therapy, but it's not working well. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to treat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents went through a difficult adoption process, and the child is causing significant emotional and physical harm. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where the child has trouble forming healthy attachments. The parents are clearly struggling, and the child's actions are dangerous and disruptive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering returning the child. From a moral standpoint, adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also a legal and emotional bond. However, the parents are being physically harmed, and the child's behavior is putting others at risk. The parents are doing their best, but the situation is overwhelming. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Is it wrong to want to give a child back when they're in danger and the child's well-being might also be at stake? If the parents can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's not in the child's best interest either. However, the decision to give a child up is huge and should be made carefully, perhaps with the help of professionals. \n\nThe key points are the parents' safety, the child's mental health, and whether there are other options. The parents have tried everything, and the child isn't responding to interventions. In some cases, if a child is in danger or the parents can't cope, it might be necessary to seek alternative placements. But legally and ethically, it's complicated. \n\nI think the parents are not in the wrong for considering this, given the circumstances. They've made every effort and are struggling. The child's diagnosis makes long-term care challenging. While it's a difficult decision, prioritizing safety and well-being could justify their consideration. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong)."
