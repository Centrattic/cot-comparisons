Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe couple decided to adopt because of infertility issues. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti. The child now six is described as having violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and has been involved in problematic incidents at home and school. They've tried various approaches like therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement, but the behavior persists. The child has Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD), which is mentioned as not curable. The author is feeling exhausted and is considering giving the child back, but feels conflicted about it, seeking opinions.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and returning a child isn't necessarily straightforward. There might be legal procedures involved, especially if the adoption is closed. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong\" morally, the focus is more on ethical responsibility.\n\nThe couple made a commitment to adopt, and the child has medical and psychological challenges. They've made efforts to provide therapy and support, but the child's behavior is severe and affecting their safety and well-being. RAD is a disorder where the child struggles to form emotional attachments, which might explain the lack of bonding. The author is in a very stressful situation with physical harm from the child.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for considering returning the child? It's a complex issue. On one hand, parents have a responsibility to care for their children, even those with challenges. On the other hand, the child's behavior is endangering the parents' safety and their ability to function as a family. The author mentions exhaustion and the child's unresponsiveness to treatment, which could be seen as valid reasons for seeking help or alternative solutions.\n\nIn some cases, families might seek foster care or specialized facilities if they can't manage the child's needs. But the author is considering giving back the child, which might mean returning him to the country of origin or another adoption. However, international adoptions can have different protocols. If the child was adopted through a legal process, returning him might require the consent of the original guardians or the adoption agency.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the couple is being irresponsible by considering relinquishment due to the child's challenges. They have already invested a lot of time and resources into therapy and support. But if the situation is becoming abusive or harmful, prioritizing their safety and mental health could be justified. The key points are the child's well-being and the parents' ability to provide a safe environment.\n\nAnother angle is the child's best interests. If the parents are unable to meet his needs and are in danger, perhaps the child might be better off in a more equipped environment. However, moving him back to Haiti could have its own issues, like the child not knowing the culture or language, or the country's ability to support such children. There's also the trauma of being removed from a home again.\n\nThe author's feelings of guilt and conflict are evident. They mention trying to talk themselves out of feeling this way. It's important to consider that parental stress can lead to difficult decisions, and it's not a simple matter of right or wrong. However, the physical abuse from the child is a significant factor. Parents have the right to their safety and well-being. If the child is a danger to them, then seeking a solution might be necessary.\n\nIn terms of societal or moral judgment, some might argue that once a child is adopted, the parents should never give up, while others might understand the extreme circumstances. The fact that the child has a disorder that's challenging to manage could mitigate the author's responsibility, but the duty to protect the child's needs and their own safety complicates it.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between the parents' commitment and their capacity to manage the situation. If all resources are exhausted and the child's behavior is causing harm, then the parents might not be in the wrong. But if there are still avenues to explore (like more therapy, specialized schools, support groups) that haven't been tried, the author might be rushing into a decision. However, the scenario states that they've tried various methods, and the disorder is not curable, which limits the options.\n\nTherefore, considering the author's safety and the child's potential betterment in a different environment where they can receive appropriate care, the author might not be in the wrong. The decision is made in a context of severe challenges and emotional distress. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
