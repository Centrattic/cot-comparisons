Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, the author and her husband went through a tough process to adopt a child from Haiti. They tried other options like IVF and surrogacy but went with adoption. The child is now six, adopted at three. He has been challenging with violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and even physical aggression towards them and others. They've tried various methods, therapy, but nothing's working well. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to treat. The author feels exhausted and is considering giving him back.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but there are cases where it's not working out. The child's behavior is extreme and dangerous, affecting both the child and the family. The parents have exhausted multiple strategies and professional help. The child's well-being is also a factor\u2014being in an environment where he's causing harm and not getting the support he needs isn't helping either.\n\nOn one hand, adoption is a big commitment, and walking away might be seen as abandoning the child. But on the other hand, the parents' safety and mental health are important too. The child might need more specialized care than they can provide. Reactive attachment disorder is serious and can be challenging for even experienced caregivers. If the parents are at risk of harm, then seeking help or another placement might be necessary to protect everyone involved.\n\nI think the key points are the parents' efforts to help, the child's needs, and their own well-being. Since they've tried everything and it's not working, and the child is in a state where he's not responding well, maybe giving him back is a way to ensure he gets better help. The parents are not doing this lightly\u2014they're consulting forums and trying to talk themselves out of it, which shows they feel conflicted but are prioritizing their situation. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
