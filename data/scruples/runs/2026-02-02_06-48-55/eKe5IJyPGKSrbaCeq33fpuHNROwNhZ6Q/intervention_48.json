Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation involves a child with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), leading to challenging behaviors like violence and destruction. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, but it's not working well.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what RAD is. It's a condition where a child has difficulty forming healthy emotional attachments, often due to past trauma or neglect. The behaviors described\u2014tantrums, aggression, lack of empathy\u2014are common in RAD. The parents have made significant efforts, including therapy, different parenting strategies, but the child isn't responding as hoped.\n\nNow, the core question: Is the parent in the wrong for considering giving the child back? From a general standpoint, parents have a right to seek a better life for themselves and their family, especially when they're overwhelmed. However, the child's well-being is a major concern here. Adoption is a permanent commitment, and considering returning a child can be seen as a failure to provide a stable home. But the parent is facing extreme stress and the child's behavior is severe, making it a tough situation.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: In many places, once a child is adopted, returning them isn't straightforward. The adoption is intended to be permanent. The parents might need to go through legal processes, perhaps finding another family or foster care. However, if the parents are considering this due to the child's behavior and their own capacity, it's a complex issue. They might be looking for a better environment for the child where he can get the necessary support, but the emotional toll on the child must be considered too.\n\nThe parent's perspective is one of exhaustion and desperation. They've tried everything, and the situation is affecting their health. On the other hand, the child might benefit more from professional help or a different setting, but it's unclear if another family would be able to handle it. There's also the question of whether the parents are giving up too soon, but given the severity of the issues and the diagnosis, it's possible that they've done all they can within their means.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a push to support families in crisis. Programs and resources might exist to help them manage the situation without giving up the child. However, the parents might not have access to these or may have exhausted them. The parent's decision could be seen as a last resort rather than an abandonment.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's a difficult situation, the parents' intention is to seek help for both themselves and the child. The child's needs are significant, and with RAD, a different approach or environment might be necessary. The parents might not be in the wrong if they're acting in the best interest of the child, even if it's painful. However, the permanence of adoption complicates things. The answer might lean towards not in the wrong (B) because they're making a tough decision under immense pressure, but it's a nuanced issue.\n"
