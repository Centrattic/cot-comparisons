Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author and her husband decided to adopt a child from Haiti after finding out she's infertile. The child, now six, has been challenging with violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and aggression. They've tried various parenting approaches and therapy, but the behavior at home and school is severe. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The author is considering giving him back and is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethics here. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also a legal and emotional process. The parents have put a lot into this, but the child's behavior is causing significant harm. The key points here are the safety of the parents, the child's well-being, and the legal/ethical responsibilities.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional attachments. It can stem from neglect or frequent caregivers, which might be part of the child's history in Haiti. The parents have tried everything\u2014therapy, discipline, etc.\u2014but the child's actions are harmful. The author is physically harmed by the child, which is a red flag. No parent should have to endure abuse from their child, adopted or biological.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving him back. From an ethical standpoint, the parents have a responsibility to ensure the child's needs are met, but also their own safety and well-being. If the child is a danger to the parents or if the parents can't provide a safe environment, it might be in the child's best interest to be placed in another home that can handle his needs better. However, the process of adoption is not simple, and returning a child can be legally complex. But ethically, if the parents are in danger and have exhausted all options, it's not necessarily wrong to consider it.\n\nHowever, there's a need to consider if all possible supports have been accessed. The parents mention therapy and various parenting strategies. But maybe they need more specialized resources or a different therapeutic approach. But given the information, they've tried a lot. The child's actions are escalating and dangerous. The author is also experiencing emotional and physical exhaustion, which affects parenting capacity.\n\nSo, the author's intention is to protect herself and her husband, which is valid. It's not about not loving the child but recognizing that the current situation is unsustainable and potentially harmful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for considering returning the child, especially if it's in everyone's best interest. The answer would be B (No).\n"
