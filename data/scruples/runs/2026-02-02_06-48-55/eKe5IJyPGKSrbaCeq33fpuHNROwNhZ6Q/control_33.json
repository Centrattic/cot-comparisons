Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a parent who is considering giving back their adopted son) is in the wrong. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the parents adopted a child from Haiti. The child has behavioral issues, including aggression and destructive behavior. They've tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, positive reinforcement\u2014but the child's behavior hasn't improved much. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is challenging. The parent is physically and emotionally exhausted, and considering returning the child.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for considering this. From one angle, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving a child back might be seen as abandoning them, especially if they have special needs. But another perspective is that the parents' well-being and safety are important too. If the child's behavior is causing harm, and all resources have been exhausted without improvement, maybe the parents are making a responsible decision for their own family's health.\n\nHowever, adoption laws and ethical considerations might require the parents to explore all possible options before giving up. The parents have tried therapy and different parenting strategies, but if the child is a danger to others, perhaps it's necessary. Yet, the child might not be getting the support he needs elsewhere. The parents might feel they can't provide the care he needs, which is understandable.\n\nThe key factors here are: the well-being of the parents and any other children in the home, the child's needs, and the possibility of finding an alternative solution. If the parents are in danger or the child is harming others, then the parents' decision might be justified. However, if there's a chance to get more help or find a specialized facility, maybe they should try that first.\n\nI think the parents are in a very difficult situation. They've made a significant commitment by adopting, but their safety and the child's well-being are both at stake. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the parents are considering the child's needs and their own safety, even though it's a tough choice. They might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their family's health when all else has failed.\n"
