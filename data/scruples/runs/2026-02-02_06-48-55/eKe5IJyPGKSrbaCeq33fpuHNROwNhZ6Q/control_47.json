Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the adoption story is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple adopted a child from Haiti when the mother was infertile. The child has been violent, with tantrums, destructive behavior, and even physically abusive actions towards the mother. He has Reactive Attachment Disorder, which is mentioned as incurable. They've tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, etc.\u2014but the behavior continues, leading to the child being at risk of expulsion from school.\n\nThe key points here are the child's behavior and the parents' well-being. The parents have clearly made significant efforts, including therapy and adapting their environment. The child's actions are harmful and persistent, and the parents are experiencing emotional and physical distress. Reactive Attachment Disorder is a severe condition affecting the child's ability to form healthy attachments, which complicates things.\n\nNow, considering ethical and legal aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and returning a child isn't as simple as returning a product. However, the parents are considering it for their own well-being and safety. The child's needs are also a factor; if the parents can't provide a safe environment, maybe he needs another placement where he can get the necessary support.\n\nBut is the parent in the wrong? From a moral standpoint, the parents have a right to their safety and mental health. They've done everything possible, and if the situation is unmanageable despite efforts, it's not necessarily their fault. However, giving up might be seen as abandoning a child in need, but the parents might not have the resources or ability to handle it anymore.\n\nLegally, the process for returning an adopted child varies, but if the parents are making the decision for their own safety and the child's, it's a complex issue. The parents might not be in the wrong if their decision is made in good faith and they're seeking the best possible outcome for the child, even if that means finding another home.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents have made substantial efforts, the child's condition is a significant factor, and their well-being is also important. The decision to give back the child isn't made lightly, so the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
