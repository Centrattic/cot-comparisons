Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question about giving back their adopted son is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple adopted a child from Haiti who is now 6. He has behavioral issues, including violence, destruction, and aggression toward his parents. He's been in therapy for 1.5 years with some improvement but not enough. The parents are considering giving him back due to the stress and harm he's causing. They mention he has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure.\n\nSo, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Let me break it down. Adoption is a big commitment, and the parents have tried various methods\u2014therapy, different parenting approaches, etc. The child's behavior is severe and not improving enough. The parents are exhausted and harmed physically and emotionally.\n\nOn one hand, the parents did make a commitment to adopt, which is a lifelong responsibility. But on the other hand, the child has significant issues that they can't manage, and the parents are in a bad situation. The child was adopted from Haiti, and giving him back would mean returning him to his country, which might be in his best interest if he can get better support there. Or maybe there's a foster care system involved?\n\nAlso, reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that affects how a child forms bonds. It's possible that the parents have done everything they can, and it's not their fault. They might be doing the right thing by seeking help and considering giving him back if they can't manage anymore. The key here is whether they're responsible for the child's behavior or if they've done their best and it's just not working out.\n\nBut is giving a child back considered wrong? It's a tough decision, but if the parents are in danger and the child isn't improving, it might be in the child's best interest to be placed in a better environment. The parents are also being honest about their struggles and seeking advice, which shows they're trying to do what's right.\n\nSo, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. They've tried everything, the child has a disorder, and they're making a difficult decision for everyone's well-being. However, some might say they should have known more before adopting. But given the circumstances, it's a valid choice.\n"
