Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by understanding the situation they described.\n\nSo, the author and their husband decided to adopt a child from Haiti because the author is infertile. The child is now six, and they've been through a lot with his behavior\u2014violent tantrums, destructive actions at home and school, physical aggression towards them. He's been in therapy for 1.5 years, which helps at the therapist's office but not at home or school. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which the author mentions is not curable. The author is feeling exhausted and considering giving the child back.\n\nNow, the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong for thinking about giving him back. Let me break down the factors here. First, the child has significant behavioral issues that are impacting the family's well-being. The parents have tried various methods\u2014firmness, therapy, different parenting strategies\u2014but nothing seems to last. The child's actions are causing physical and emotional harm to the parents. The author is clearly struggling, feeling neglected by the child despite providing care.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a real condition where children have trouble forming healthy emotional bonds. It's a serious disorder often linked to early neglect or abuse. The parents adopted this child from Haiti, which might mean he had a traumatic past before adoption. The author is trying to do the right thing but is overwhelmed.\n\nNow, considering ethics and legal aspects. In many places, once a child is legally adopted, the parents have legal guardianship and the responsibility to care for the child. If they feel they can't provide a safe environment, they might need to seek help through the system, like contacting child protective services or working with adoption agencies to find another placement. However, deciding to give back a child is not a decision to be taken lightly, especially if the child is in a stable environment.\n\nBut the author is at their breaking point. They mention being physically harmed by the child and emotional exhaustion. Their mental health is suffering. In such cases, it's important to consider their well-being as well. However, the key question is whether they're in the wrong for considering this. \n\nSociety often judges people harshly when it comes to adoption, especially if the child has special needs. But the parents have made a genuine effort to provide support and care. The child's behavior isn't their fault, but the parents' situation is dire. They might be in a position where they can't safely care for the child anymore, which could lead to the child being placed in a better-suited environment. \n\nThe author is also seeking advice from forums, indicating they're looking for validation and support. They might be feeling guilty or ashamed for even considering giving the child back. But in cases where parents are at risk of harm and the child's needs exceed their capabilities, sometimes the right decision is to seek help through proper channels.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They tried everything possible, but the situation is beyond their control. They are not neglecting the child; they are doing the opposite by seeking therapy and support. Their decision to consider returning the child might be in the best interest of both the child and themselves. However, legally and ethically, they might have responsibilities to ensure the child's safety. But in this context, they're seeking advice on whether they're at fault for considering giving the child back, not for actually doing so.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer would likely be B (No) because the author is not in the wrong for considering this given the circumstances. They are in a difficult situation where their well-being and the child's safety might be compromised, and they're seeking guidance on a tough decision.\n"
