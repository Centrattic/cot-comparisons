Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The couple adopted a boy from Haiti who has significant behavioral issues, including violence and attachment disorder. The parents have tried everything\u2014therapy, discipline methods, etc.\u2014but the child is causing them physical harm and is at risk of expulsion from school.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and considering giving the child back. The child has reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is a real condition where a child doesn't form healthy attachments to caregivers. The parents have been trying for years, but the situation is deteriorating.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this. Is the author wrong for wanting to give the child back? Let's consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also important to recognize when a situation is harmful to both the child and the family. The child's well-being is a factor here too. If the current environment is causing harm, perhaps a change is necessary. However, adoption agencies often have processes for such situations, like reunification with birth family or transferring to another adoptive family. The parents might not be in the wrong if they're considering the child's best interest, even if it's painful for them.\n\nBut the user is suggesting the author is in the wrong. Maybe they believe the parents should stick it out no matter what. But given the circumstances\u2014RAD, physical abuse, failed interventions\u2014it's a complex scenario. The parents are doing their best, but sometimes the best option isn't to persevere in a harmful situation. It's a tough call. The answer hinges on whether prioritizing their well-being and the child's safety makes them \"wrong.\" I think the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to protect themselves and the child from ongoing harm.\n"
