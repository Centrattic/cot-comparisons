Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband tried to have kids but couldn't. They decided on adoption, which they felt was selfless. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti. Now the kid is six and has serious behavioral issues. He's violent, destructive, and in therapy. The author is considering giving him back because they can't handle it anymore. They mention feeling physically and emotionally exhausted, and the child doesn't seem to have a bond with them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Are there any legal or ethical issues here? The child has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to manage. The parent is under a lot of stress. They've tried everything\u2014therapy, discipline methods, etc. But the child is still acting out. The parent is being abused physically. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, adoption is a binding legal process, but there might be options like termination of parental rights or returning the child through the adoption agency, depending on the circumstances and the country's laws. However, the question is about moral or ethical wrong, not legal.\n\nEthically, the parent is in a tough spot. They made a commitment to adopt, but the child has significant needs they can't meet. The parent's well-being is also a factor here. If they're being physically harmed, it's a safety issue. However, the child's well-being is also important. If they're returned, maybe to another family or foster care, but the parent might feel they're abandoning the child.\n\nBut the parent is considering this due to their own limits. Are there other options? They mention therapy, but it's not working. Maybe more intensive interventions, or residential programs. But if those aren't feasible, the parent might not have the resources.\n\nThe key points are the parent's exhaustion, the child's challenging behavior, and the lack of improvement. The parent is considering giving him back as a last resort. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parent is in a situation beyond their control, and their decision is out of desperation and self-preservation, not malice. They've tried everything, and it's affecting their safety and health. However, others might argue that they should have prepared for the challenges of adoption. But given the circumstances, the parent isn't acting out of selfishness but necessity.\n"
