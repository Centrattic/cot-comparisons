Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an adopted son causing a lot of problems. The parents tried adoption because the mother is infertile, and they got a three-year-old from Haiti. Now he's six and has been acting out with violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and even physical abuse towards the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The child was adopted from Haiti when he was three, so he might have had some traumatic experiences before being adopted. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is a condition where a child has trouble forming healthy emotional connections. RAD is tough because it's not curable, but it can be managed with therapy and support. The parents have tried various approaches: firmness, positive reinforcement, therapy for over a year and a half. The therapist says he's well-behaved there, but at home and school, it's bad. He's at risk of expulsion from school for violent acts like kicking a teacher and cutting a girl's hair. The mom is physically harmed too.\n\nNow, the author is considering giving the child back, feeling guilty for even thinking that. They're exhausted emotionally and physically. The question is whether they're in the wrong for wanting to return the child.\n\nI need to check if there are any legal obligations or if there's a process they need to follow. Adoption in the US, especially international, usually involves legal finality. If the adoption is finalized, returning the child might be complicated and require legal steps. But the question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal.\n\nMoral standpoint: The parents have tried everything possible\u2014therapy, discipline methods, support. The child's behavior is beyond their control, and the mother is being physically harmed. The child has a disorder they can't cure. The parents feel they can't provide a safe environment anymore. So, is it wrong to consider giving him back?\n\nOn one hand, they did everything they could. They adopted a child in need, which is a selfless act. They've invested time and resources into therapy. But the child's behavior is harmful, and they can't manage it. The parents' well-being is also a factor. On the other hand, some might argue that once you adopt a child, you have a duty to care for them regardless of challenges. But in this case, the child's actions are dangerous and abusive, and the parents are being physically harmed. If they can't provide safety, maybe it's not in the child's interest to stay in that environment either.\n\nAlso, the child is from Haiti; returning him might be a complex process. However, the question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" not whether returning is possible. The key here is the parents' situation and the child's well-being. If the child isn't safe in the home and the parents are being harmed, maybe the parents are not in the wrong for considering it. They might be doing it for the child's own good too, to get him help he can't get from them.\n\nBut some might say that giving up on adoption is a failure. But given the circumstances\u2014RAD, the extensive efforts they've made, and the physical abuse\u2014it's a complex situation. The parents are trying to do what's right but are overwhelmed. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they've tried everything possible, and the child's behavior is beyond their control, posing risks to their safety.\n"
