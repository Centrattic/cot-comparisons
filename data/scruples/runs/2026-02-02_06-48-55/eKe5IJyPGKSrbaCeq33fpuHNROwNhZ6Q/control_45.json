Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a three-year-old from Haiti now six, dealing with severe behavioral issues, including violence towards the parents and others. The kid has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to treat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They've tried everything\u2014firm and soft approaches, discipline, therapy. The child is destructive, in trouble at school, and physically abusive. The mother feels emotionally and physically drained. Reactive attachment disorder is a real challenge, and they've been through a lot. \n\nOn the other hand, adoption is a big commitment, especially for older kids who may have had difficult pasts. The parents decided on adoption as the selfless route, but now they're facing these challenges. They're not giving up without trying, but maybe they feel it's too much. \n\nBut is it their fault? Are they in the wrong? They didn't abandon the child lightly. They've given him a home, therapy, support. The child's behaviors are beyond their control despite all efforts. The parents' well-being and safety matter too. If the child is abusive, the parents might feel they can't provide a safe environment anymore. \n\nHowever, some might argue that once you adopt, you can't give up so easily. But that's a moral stance. The question is about whether they're \"in the wrong.\" Legally, they might have to follow certain procedures to return the child, but morally? The parents' health is important. If they're being physically harmed, they have a right to protect themselves. \n\nAlso, the child might need a different environment where they can get more specialized care. The parents could be doing the right thing by seeking a placement where he can receive better support. So maybe they're not in the wrong. Their intentions are to help the child but also to survive the situation. \n\nBut maybe they should have known the risks before adopting. However, it's one thing to know the possibility and another to experience it. They might have expected challenges but not to this extent. \n\nIn conclusion, the parents are in a tough spot. They're considering giving back the child out of necessity, not malice. Their safety and mental health are valid concerns. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
