Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The couple adopted a child from Haiti, and the child has significant behavioral issues, including violent outbursts, aggression towards parents and others, and a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder (RAD). The parents have tried various strategies\u2014therapy, discipline methods, etc.\u2014but nothing seems to work consistently. The mother is being physically harmed by the child.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what reactive attachment disorder is. RAD is a condition where a child can't form healthy emotional attachments to caregivers, often due to early neglect or trauma. It's serious and can lead to behavioral issues. The key here is that it's a medical diagnosis, and the parents are doing their best with therapy and other interventions. However, the child's behavior is escalating and dangerous.\n\nNow, the parents are considering giving the child back. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The user is looking for a judgment call. In terms of ethics, the parent's well-being and the child's safety are both important. If the child is a danger to the parents and others, maybe the parents need to prioritize their own safety. But adoption usually comes with legal obligations and the child's best interest is a priority. However, in some cases, if a child is in a home that can't meet their needs, it might be considered in their best interest to find another placement.\n\nThe parents have tried everything, but the situation is deteriorating. The mother is being physically harmed, which is a serious issue. If the parents can't provide a safe environment, then giving the child back might be necessary for the child's safety as well. The parents can't be effective caregivers if they're in danger. \n\nBut there's a societal expectation that once you adopt, you must keep the child no matter what. However, that's not a legal or ethical requirement. Parents can't be forced to stay in a situation that's harmful to them or others. Also, the child might need specialized care that the parents can't provide, so placing him in a facility with more resources could be better for him in the long run.\n\nOn the flip side, giving the child back might cause him further trauma. He's already dealing with attachment issues. But if the parents can't provide a stable environment, it's potentially more harmful to keep him in a chaotic home. The parents have a right to seek help, and if all options have been exhausted, they're not in the wrong for considering this.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They've made a good-faith effort, the situation is beyond their control, and their safety is at risk. The child's well-being is also a concern if the parents can't provide a safe environment. The parents aren't malicious; they're overwhelmed and need to prioritize their own and others' safety.\n"
