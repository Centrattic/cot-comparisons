Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The couple adopted a boy from Haiti when he was three. He's now six and has been exhibiting severe behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destruction, aggression, and even physical abuse towards the mother. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is a disorder where a child has difficulty forming emotional attachments. The parents have tried various methods like therapy, discipline, and positive reinforcement, but the behavior continues, leading the mother to consider giving him back.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the mother is in the wrong for considering returning the child. Let's break down the factors.\n\n1. **Adoption Context**: The couple chose adoption after considering other options. They were aware of the potential challenges but went ahead. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, so maybe there are expectations of permanence here. However, the child's behavior is extreme and dangerous.\n\n2. **Child's Behavior**: The boy's actions are not just typical difficult behavior. He's physically violent towards his parents and other children, which raises safety concerns. The mother has been injured multiple times. This is serious and could be a safety risk for the child himself as well as others.\n\n3. **Professional Help**: They've tried therapy for over a year and a half with some improvement, but it's not lasting. The therapist's role is important here. If the child is in therapy and still not improving, maybe the parents are doing everything they can. However, RAD is a complex disorder and might require specialized interventions beyond what they've tried. Are there other resources or treatments available?\n\n4. **Parental Responsibility and Well-being**: The mother is emotionally and physically exhausted. Parenting a child with such severe needs is incredibly demanding. The question is whether the parents have done enough before considering giving him back. Are there any legal or ethical obligations they must consider?\n\n5. **Legal Aspects**: In many jurisdictions, once an adoption is finalized, it's a permanent legal process. Returning a child would require going through legal channels, potentially involving the court. The parents might need to prove that the child's well-being is at risk if they can't handle the situation. However, the mother's safety is also a concern here.\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it ethical to return a child who has been adopted, especially after investing so much time and effort? On the other hand, is it ethical to keep a child in an environment where they are causing harm and where the parents can't provide a safe environment anymore?\n\n7. **Alternative Solutions**: Are there other options besides returning the child? For example, residential treatment programs, placing the child in a specialized foster care, or getting additional support from professionals or the community. The parents might feel they've exhausted all options, but maybe there are more avenues to explore.\n\n8. **Emotional Impact on the Child**: If they return him, what happens to the child? He might be placed in another home, but if his behavior continues, it could lead to further instability for him. However, staying in an unsafe environment might also be detrimental.\n\nNow, considering all these points, the key factors are the safety of the parents, the child's well-being, and whether the parents have done everything possible. The mother has been physically harmed, which is a critical point. Safety issues can't be ignored. If the parents can't ensure their safety or the child's safety, then maybe returning him is a responsible decision.\n\nOn the other hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving up might be seen as abandoning the child. However, the mother is considering this out of necessity due to the extreme circumstances, not because they don't care. The parents have tried many things and are seeking advice, indicating they are struggling but still trying to find a solution.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have a moral obligation and have tried their best, the immediate safety concerns and the lack of improvement despite efforts might justify considering returning the child. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
