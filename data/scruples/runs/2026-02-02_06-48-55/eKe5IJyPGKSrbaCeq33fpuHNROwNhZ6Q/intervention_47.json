Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and their husband are infertile and decided to adopt. They adopted a boy from Haiti when he was three. Now he's six. The child has been having violent tantrums, is destructive, and has behavioral issues at home and school. He's been to therapy, but it's not enough. He's been physically abusive towards the mother, and at school, he's kicked a teacher and hurt other kids. The diagnosis is reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The author is considering giving him back because they feel overwhelmed and exhausted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole). The author is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting to give up their adopted son. The question is whether this decision makes them the \"asshole.\"\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional attachments. The child in question is showing signs of RAD. The author mentions that the child doesn't feel anything for them or the husband, which is a key symptom of RAD.\n\nThe author is dealing with extreme stress and physical abuse from the child. They've tried various methods\u2014firmness, softness, therapy, etc.\u2014but the child's behavior is escalating. The author is exhausted and feeling like they can't cope anymore. They've sought advice from parenting forums and adoption subreddits, which shows they're trying to seek solutions before making a decision.\n\nNow, the ethical considerations. Giving a child back might seem like abandoning him, but if the child is in a safe environment and there's another family that can provide the necessary care, it's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the author is considering giving him back because they can't handle it anymore, which could be seen as selfish. But they also have a right to their mental and physical well-being.\n\nIn some cases, when a child's needs are too overwhelming and the parents are unable to meet them despite efforts, returning the child to the agency or considering alternative placements can be the right decision. The key is whether the child will be in a better situation. If the author feels that they can't provide the necessary care and there's no other support, it's a hard choice but not necessarily in the wrong.\n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they are not doing everything possible to support the child. But the story says they've tried everything\u2014therapy, different parenting styles, etc. The child's condition is a medical issue, and they're not to blame for the child's behavior.\n\nAnother angle: adoption can be a lifelong commitment, and the author might feel they're breaking that commitment. But if the situation is endangering their safety or the child's well-being, it's a different story. The child's actions are violent and destructive, which could be a sign that he needs more specialized care than the author can provide.\n\nSo, putting it all together. The author is in a very difficult situation. They've made a commitment to adopt and have tried all possible solutions. The child's behavior is a result of his own psychological issues, not the parents' actions. The author's decision to give him back stems from their inability to cope and the risk of harm to themselves and others. In that case, they might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that they should try harder or seek more resources. But given the circumstances, the author's well-being and safety are also important. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
