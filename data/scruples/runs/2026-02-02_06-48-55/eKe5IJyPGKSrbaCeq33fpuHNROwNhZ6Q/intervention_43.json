Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The couple adopted a child from Haiti who has behavioral issues, including violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and even physical aggression towards the mother. They've tried various methods, therapy, but things aren't getting better. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to treat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The parents have made a commitment through adoption, which is a legal and emotional process. But the child is causing them significant harm and stress. The mother is being physically abused by her own child. That's a serious issue. \n\nNow, the question is whether they are in the wrong for wanting to return him. On one hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving up might seem like the easy way out. But the parents are clearly struggling, and the child's well-being and the parents' safety are at stake. The child has a disorder that makes him act out, and this isn't just a phase. Also, the parents have tried everything possible. \n\nIt's important to note that reactive attachment disorder can make it hard for the child to form healthy bonds. The parents might not be doing anything wrong; it's just a challenging situation. So, the mother feeling like she's being attacked and seeking help isn't necessarily her fault. \n\nLegally, giving up an adopted child can be complicated, but emotionally, it's a tough decision. The parents might need to consider the long-term effects on the child as well. Maybe they can't provide the care he needs, and keeping him might harm everyone involved. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They are in a very difficult situation where their well-being and the child's future are both at risk. It's not a matter of being selfish but of recognizing that they need help beyond what they can provide. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
