Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is that the child has significant behavioral issues, including physical aggression, destruction, and emotional detachment. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, but the child's behavior persists. The child has RAD, which is a disorder affecting emotional bonds.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Adoption is a legal process, so returning a child isn't as simple as giving them back. The parents might need to go through legal procedures, possibly involving the adoption agency or the court. They have a responsibility to provide a safe environment. If the child is a danger to himself or others, maybe they have a duty to seek alternative arrangements.\n\nNext, the parents' well-being. The mother mentions physical abuse from the child, which is a serious issue. Their emotional and physical health is important. If they can't manage the situation safely, they might not be in the wrong for seeking help. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically.\n\nAdoption is supposed to be a lifelong commitment, but there might be exceptions. If the child's behavior is beyond their capacity to handle despite all efforts, they might not be in the wrong. But there's also a responsibility to find solutions before considering giving him back. They mentioned trying therapy, different parenting methods, etc., so maybe they've done their due diligence.\n\nAnother angle: the child's best interest. If returning him could lead to another home where he can thrive, maybe it's in his best interest. But if the agency or birth parents have rights, that could complicate things. Also, the age of the child\u2014six years old. Breaking the bond at this point might be traumatic for him.\n\nBut given the severity of the issues, and the parents' safety being at risk, it's possible they are not in the wrong. Their motivation isn't selfish; they tried everything but can't manage anymore. However, some might argue that once you adopt, you're committed. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the parents have explored all possible options and if the child's well-being is prioritized. Since they've done therapy, tried different approaches, and the child's behavior is dangerous, maybe they're justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing legal or ethical nuances. The key is that they are considering giving him back due to safety and well-being issues, not out of convenience. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
