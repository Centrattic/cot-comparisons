Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The story is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who's now six, and he's having a lot of behavioral issues. He's been violent, destructive, and has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, etc., but things aren't improving much. They're considering giving him back because they can't handle it anymore, but they're struggling with the guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key here is to assess whether their decision is morally or ethically wrong. Adoption is a big commitment, and the parents have already invested a lot, but they're also experiencing significant trauma and exhaustion. \n\nReactive attachment disorder is mentioned as a diagnosis that can't be cured. That's a critical point because it suggests that the child's behavior isn't just about discipline but a deeper psychological issue. The parents have tried everything\u2014therapy, positive reinforcement, different parenting styles\u2014but the child's behavior at home and school remains problematic. \n\nThe parents are considering giving the child back, not out of malice but because they can't cope anymore. They're also dealing with physical abuse from the child. It's important to note that they're not abandoning him; they're seeking a better environment where the child can get the support he needs and where the parents can recover.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the parents' well-being matters too. Sacrificing their own health and safety for a child isn't necessarily the right thing if it leads to long-term harm. Also, the child might benefit from a different setting with more resources or specialized care. However, there's a risk that if the parents give him back, the child might end up in a less supportive environment. But the question is about the parents being in the wrong, not the potential outcomes for the child.\n\nThe parents are struggling emotionally and physically, and they're honest about their limits. They've explored all options and are at their breaking point. It's possible that the decision is out of self-preservation and a desire to find a better long-term solution for everyone involved. \n\nIn many cases, people might criticize the parents for not trying harder, but given the diagnosis and the severity of the situation, it's a complex situation. The parents are not neglecting the child; they're providing care and therapy. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for considering giving him back. They're acting from a place of exhaustion and a need to protect themselves while also considering the child's needs. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
