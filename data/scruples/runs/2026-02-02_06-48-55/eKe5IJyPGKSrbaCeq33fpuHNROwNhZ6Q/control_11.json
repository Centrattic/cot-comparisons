Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me start by understanding the details.\n\nThe author and her husband decided on adoption because of her infertility and medical issues. They adopted a three-year-old boy from Haiti, now six. He has violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and has been physically abusive towards her. He's been in therapy for 1.5 years, behaves better there, but at home and school, he's problematic\u2014kicked a teacher, cut a girl's hair, flooded toilets. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The author is exhausted and considering giving him back, even though she's trying to talk herself out of it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the child's diagnosed disorder, the efforts they've made (therapy, discipline methods, etc.), and the ongoing harm to the parents. Adoption is a serious commitment, but the child's behavior is affecting the parents' well-being and safety. The question is whether wanting to give him back is a valid decision or if they have a responsibility to keep him.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a condition where children have trouble forming healthy emotional bonds, often due to past trauma or neglect. It's challenging, and the parents have been trying various approaches. The child's actions are not just misbehavior but aggression towards the mother, which is concerning. The mother is experiencing physical abuse, which is a significant issue. \n\nIn such cases, the parents' safety and mental health are critical. While adoption requires a long-term commitment, no one should be in a situation where they're being harmed. The child might need more specialized care or resources that the parents can't provide. The mother is seeking advice because she's struggling, which shows she's trying to find a solution, not just being reckless.\n\nI should consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The parents made a choice in good faith, but circumstances have made it impossible to continue safely. The question isn't about them being bad parents but about the feasibility of their current situation. The answer likely leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because they've made reasonable efforts and the child's needs are beyond their capacity, especially with a diagnosis that's hard to manage. It's important to look at the well-being of both the parents and the child. If they can't provide a safe environment, it's not just their right but perhaps a responsibility to seek a better placement for the child.\n"
