Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who has behavioral issues, including violence towards them and others, and a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. They've tried various methods, therapy, etc., but the situation is getting worse. The parents are exhausted and considering giving the child back.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, but if the child is adopted, can the parents just give them back? That's a big question. In many places, once a child is legally adopted, the parents can't just return them. They might have to go through the court or contact the agency. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for considering it because they might feel they have no other option. But legally, they might have to follow certain steps.\n\nEmotionally, the parents are struggling. They've tried everything, and the child isn't responding well. The child is causing them physical harm. The parents have a right to their own safety and mental health. If the child is putting them in danger, then it's understandable they would consider other options. However, the child's well-being is also a concern. Taking a child away from the only home they know isn't something to be taken lightly. \n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where the child has trouble forming emotional bonds. The parents might have been warned about this before adoption, or maybe not. If they were not informed, that's a different issue. But the key here is whether the parents are in the wrong for wanting to give the child back. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's origin. Adopting from Haiti might have different circumstances, like the child being in the system there for a reason. But the parents' responsibility is to provide a safe environment. If they can't do that, maybe the child would be better served in a different placement. But again, the parents might need to work with authorities to find a solution.\n\nAnother angle: The parents are seeking advice from forums, indicating they're trying to find a solution. They don't want to be in this situation but feel they have no choice. The child's behavior is causing them harm and threatening his education. It's a tough situation where both the parents' rights and the child's needs are at stake.\n\nSo, legally and ethically, is the author wrong? If they proceed to give the child back through proper channels, maybe not. The problem is that the question is about whether they are in the wrong for considering it. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. Some might say that once you adopt, you can't give up, but realistically, if the child is a danger to the family, it's a different story. \n\nIn conclusion, considering the child's well-being and the parents' health, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for considering giving the child back. They've tried everything and are in a desperate situation. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
