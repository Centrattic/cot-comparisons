Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The couple adopted a child from Haiti when the mother was infertile. The child has been acting out with violent behavior, causing physical harm to the parents and other kids, and is in therapy but not improving much. They\u2019ve tried various methods, and the child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical and moral aspects here. Adoption is a significant commitment, and the parents have put a lot of effort into providing for the child. However, the child's behavior is extreme and harmful, not just to the parents but also to others. The parents are experiencing physical abuse, which is a serious issue. \n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a condition where a child has difficulty forming healthy emotional attachments. It's often due to neglect or abuse in early life. RAD can lead to behavioral issues, as described here. The parents have been working with a therapist, but the progress is minimal. The child is at risk of expulsion from school, and his actions are dangerous.\n\nNow, considering the parents' rights and responsibilities. They have a duty to protect the child, but also to protect themselves and others from harm. If the child's behavior is uncontrollable and poses a danger, the parents might feel they can't provide a safe environment. However, giving back a child is a major decision, especially in adoption, which is typically permanent. But in some cases, it's possible through legal means like termination of parental rights, though it's a complex process.\n\nThe parents are struggling emotionally and physically. They've tried everything, and the child's behavior isn't improving. They feel they can't continue. The key here is whether they are in the wrong for considering this. Society often values the sanctity of the parent-child relationship, but also the safety of all involved. The parents aren't acting out of malice but out of exhaustion and inability to manage the situation. \n\nHowever, there's a need to consider if all possible support systems have been exhausted. Have they sought more specialized help, maybe different therapists or behavioral programs? But the user mentions they've tried various methods and the child's diagnosis is such that it's not curable. So maybe they've done everything possible. \n\nIn terms of moral blame, if the parents are in a situation where they can't ensure the child's or others' safety, they might not be in the wrong. The question is about whether they're at fault for wanting to give the child back. The answer would depend on societal views on adoption, mental health, and the limits of parental responsibility. \n\nI think the answer would lean towards B (No), because the parents aren't acting out of selfishness but out of necessity. They've made a significant effort and the child's condition is a medical issue beyond their control. However, there might be nuances, but given the context, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
