Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation involves a child with significant behavioral issues and a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. The parents have tried various methods to manage his behavior, but it's causing them a lot of stress and harm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child was adopted from Haiti when he was three, so he was already a few years old when he joined the family. The parents made a selfless decision to adopt, knowing their own infertility issues. The child has a diagnosed disorder, which is known to be challenging. The parents have tried therapy, different parenting approaches, but the behavior is still problematic, even leading to physical abuse towards the mother.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the mother) is in the wrong for considering returning the child. The key points here are the well-being of the parents and the child. The parents are experiencing physical harm and emotional exhaustion. While adoption is a lifelong commitment, it's also important to consider the reality of the situation. If the child's needs are too overwhelming and the family is in danger, it might be necessary to seek alternative placements.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that giving up a child could be seen as abandoning them. However, in this case, the parents are considering it out of necessity, not neglect. The child has complex needs, and the parents might not have the resources or support to handle it. The mother is seeking advice, showing she's not making a hasty decision but is truly struggling.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that can be difficult to manage, even with professional help. The parents have tried their best but are now at a breaking point. It's also important to consider the child's well-being. If the home environment is too stressful and potentially harmful, maybe a different setting with more specialized support could be better for him.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong. She's in a tough situation where she's made a good-faith effort to provide a home but is now facing circumstances beyond her control. The key here is that the decision isn't made lightly and is for the benefit of both the child and the family's safety.\n"
