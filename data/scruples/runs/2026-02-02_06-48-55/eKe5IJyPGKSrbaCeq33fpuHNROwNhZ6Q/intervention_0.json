Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should return their adopted son. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband adopted a child from Haiti. The child is now six, and has been acting out with violent tantrums, aggression, and destruction. They've tried various methods like therapy, discipline, etc., but the child has serious behavioral issues diagnosed as reactive attachment disorder. The author is considering giving the child back because of the emotional and physical toll it's taking on them.\n\nSo, the main point here is whether giving back the child is the wrong decision. Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has trouble forming emotional bonds. It's not curable, but some treatments can help manage it. The child's behavior is causing significant problems at home and school, and the parents are being harmed physically. \n\nThe author is struggling with the guilt of considering giving up the child. They mention they've sought advice from parenting forums and are trying to convince themselves otherwise. The key here is whether the author is wrong for considering this. \n\nOn one hand, the parents did everything they could to provide a good home, including therapy and different parenting strategies. The child's behavior is beyond their control, and the parents' well-being is also a concern. On the other hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving up might leave the child in a worse situation. However, the parents can't be blamed for wanting to prioritize their own well-being when the child's condition makes it impossible to maintain a safe environment. \n\nI think the parents are in a very difficult situation. They made a commitment to adopt, but the child's severe disorder is causing harm. While it's a tough decision, it's not necessarily their fault. They might not be in the wrong for considering returning the child if they believe it's in the best interest of both the child and themselves. However, they should probably explore all possible options first, like more specialized therapy or residential treatment. But given the circumstances, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
