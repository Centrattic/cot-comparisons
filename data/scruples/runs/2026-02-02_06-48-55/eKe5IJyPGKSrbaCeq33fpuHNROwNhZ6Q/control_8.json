Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who has been acting out with violent behavior, even physically abusing them. They've tried various methods, therapy, but it's not working. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The parents are exhausted and considering returning him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the factors here. First, adoption is a legal and emotional commitment. Parents take on responsibility for the child's well-being. But in this case, the child is causing harm to the parents. They mention physical abuse\u2014punches, kicks, etc. Also, the child's behavior at school is problematic, leading to possible expulsion.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a real condition where children have difficulty forming emotional bonds. Treatment is challenging, and without proper intervention, it can persist. The parents have tried multiple approaches: discipline, therapy, positive reinforcement. They've stripped his room to prevent destruction. They're emotionally and physically drained.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is whether the parents are wrong for considering giving the child back. On one hand, the parents have made a commitment, and it's their responsibility to provide a safe environment. But on the other hand, the child is harming them, and they might not be able to provide the necessary care anymore. There's also the child's well-being to consider. If they return him, where will he go? Are there other options like foster care or specialized institutions?\n\nThe parents might be in a situation where they can't safely keep the child, even if they want to. They need to prioritize their own safety and health to take care of the child properly. But the question is about being in the wrong. If they return the child, is that an act of selfishness, or is it a necessary step for everyone's safety?\n\nIn some cases, parents are advised to seek help from professionals, including looking into specialized programs or foster care that can handle severe behavioral issues. If all options have been exhausted and the situation remains dangerous, then returning the child might be the only viable option. However, there might be a stigma or judgment against parents making such a decision, leading some to say they're in the wrong.\n\nBut considering the parents' circumstances\u2014physical abuse, emotional exhaustion, and the child's inability to form attachments\u2014it's possible that the author is not in the wrong. They might be making a difficult decision to protect themselves and possibly find a more suitable environment for the child. However, others might argue that they should have known about the challenges of adoption and should stick it out.\n\nI think the key points are the parents' well-being, the safety of the family, and the child's needs. If they can't provide a safe home, then returning him isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
