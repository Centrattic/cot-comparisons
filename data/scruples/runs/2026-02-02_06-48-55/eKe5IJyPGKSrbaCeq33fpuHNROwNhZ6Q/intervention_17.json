Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The child has been adopted from Haiti, is now six, and has been acting out with violence and aggression. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, but the child still causes a lot of problems both at home and school. The author is feeling physically and emotionally abused and is considering giving the child back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, so they might not be able to just return the child. There could be a formal process to terminate the adoption, but that's different from simply giving the child back. Legally, the parents are responsible for the child's care unless they go through the proper channels. But the question is about being \"in the wrong\" morally or ethically, not legally.\n\nEmotionally, the parents are clearly struggling. They've made a commitment to adopt, which is a big decision. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which is a serious condition. The parents have tried multiple approaches, including therapy, which is commendable. However, the child's behavior is causing harm. The parents are being physically abused, which is a serious issue. \n\nOn one hand, the parents might feel they're doing everything they can and are still overwhelmed. On the other hand, giving a child back could be seen as abandoning them, especially if there's no alternative care. The parents might be considering this out of desperation and self-preservation. But is it their fault for feeling that way? Or is the real issue the system not providing adequate support?\n\nAlso, the parents mentioned they've tried everything. If they're following the proper procedures to seek help and still can't manage, perhaps they're not in the wrong. They might be in a situation where they can't cope anymore. The key here is whether they've exhausted all possible options and if they're acting in the best interest of the child. If they decide to pursue termination of the adoption through legal means, that's a process, but just giving the child back might not be the right approach. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not the legality of the action.\n\nAnother angle is the child's well-being. If the child is harming the parents and causing them emotional distress, is it in the child's best interest to stay in this environment? Or would another family be better equipped to handle the situation? But moving the child could also be traumatic. It's a tough balance.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parents are in a very difficult situation. They made an adoption decision in good faith, but the circumstances have become overwhelming. They might not be in the wrong for considering giving back the child if they believe it's the best option for everyone involved, especially if they can't provide the necessary care anymore. The real issue might be the lack of support systems for adoptive parents dealing with reactive attachment disorder. The parents are trying to make the best decision under extreme stress, even though it's painful for them. So maybe the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
