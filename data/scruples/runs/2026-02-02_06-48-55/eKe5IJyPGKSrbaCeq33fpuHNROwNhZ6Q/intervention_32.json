Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the parents adopted a child from Haiti after facing infertility. They tried various methods and decided on adoption. The child has been challenging since they adopted him\u2014violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and even physical abuse towards the mother. They've tried multiple parenting strategies, therapy, and the child has a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. The mother is emotionally and physically exhausted and is considering giving the child back, but feels guilty about it.\n\nSo the core question is: is the author (the mother) in the wrong for wanting to give up the child? \n\nI need to consider the context. The child's behavior is severe and has been ongoing, despite professional help. The parents have invested a lot of time and effort. The mother is experiencing abuse from the child and is at her breaking point. However, giving a child back is a huge decision. \n\nOn one hand, the mother's well-being and safety are important. No parent should have to endure physical abuse. The child's needs are complex, and the parents might not have the resources or support to handle it. On the other hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and considering giving up might be seen as abandoning the child, especially when there's a diagnosis that makes the child more challenging. \n\nBut the key here is the mother's mental and physical health. If she's in danger, it's reasonable for her to seek help or consider alternatives. The question is whether she's in the wrong for thinking about returning the child. \n\nIn many cases, when a child's behavior is so harmful that it's affecting the family's well-being, it's not seen as wrong to seek solutions, including possibly rehoming the child. However, the decision should be made carefully, with support and possibly through proper channels to ensure the child's safety and well-being as well. The mother is struggling, but her desire to protect herself and her family might not make her in the wrong. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). She's in a tough situation and exploring options because she's reached her limit. It's important to consider the reality of the circumstances and the human aspect of parental limitations.\n"
