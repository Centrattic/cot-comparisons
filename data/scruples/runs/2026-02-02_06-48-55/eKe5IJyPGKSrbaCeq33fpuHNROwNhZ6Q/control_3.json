Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for considering returning their adopted son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: the couple adopted a 3-year-old from Haiti. The child has behavioral issues\u2014tantrums, violence towards parents and others, and a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder. They've tried various methods (therapy, discipline, etc.) but it's not working. The parents are exhausted and considering giving the child back.\n\nI need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The parents are clearly doing their best but are overwhelmed. The child's behavior is severe and persistent, and the condition isn't curable. They've tried multiple approaches without success. On the other hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and taking a child back could be traumatic for him. Also, the parents might feel guilty or selfish for considering this.\n\nBut the key points here are the safety of the parents and the child's well-being. If the child is dangerous to himself or others, it might be necessary to seek alternative placements. The parents are also at risk of harm, which is a serious concern. They might not be able to provide a stable environment anymore. The child's needs are complex, and the parents are struggling to meet them.\n\nHowever, in the adoption process, there are usually legal and ethical guidelines. If the parents are considering returning the child, they should probably consult with adoption agencies or legal experts to ensure it's done properly and safely. The parents might also need to explore all possible resources, like more specialized therapy or support groups for reactive attachment disorder before making such a decision.\n\nBut given the severity of the situation\u2014the physical abuse, the risk of expulsion from school, and the lack of progress despite interventions\u2014it's possible that the parents are doing the right thing by considering this option to protect everyone involved. It's not a simple right-or-wrong issue, but the parents are prioritizing their safety and the child's potential for a better environment where his needs can be met more effectively.\n\nSo, based on this, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're making a difficult decision under extreme circumstances, trying to find a solution that's best for both themselves and the child in the long run, even though it's painful.\n"
