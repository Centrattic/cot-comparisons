Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is complicated. The author and her husband adopted a child from Haiti who has behavioral issues, including violence and destruction. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is chronic. The author is struggling with the emotional and physical toll, considering returning the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, and the child's well-being is a priority. However, in cases where the child is causing harm to themselves or others, or where the family can't provide adequate care, it might be necessary to seek other options. The child's behavior is extreme and persistent, even with therapy. The parents have tried various interventions without success.\n\nReactive attachment disorder means the child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. This can make parenting extremely challenging. The author mentions feeling abused by the child, which is a serious concern. The child's actions at home and school are severe, leading to expulsion risks. The parents' safety and mental health are at stake too.\n\nLegally and ethically, the decision isn't simple. The parents might need to involve child protective services or seek legal counsel if they're considering giving the child back. However, the author is asking if they're in the wrong morally. Adoption agencies typically have processes for such situations, but it's not a straightforward return like a store. The child's best interest should guide the decision, not just the parents' hardships.\n\nThe author's exhaustion and the child's unmet needs are both valid points. However, if the child is in a harmful environment, removing them for their own safety could be necessary. On the other hand, the parents tried multiple strategies, so they might have done their part. The key is whether they've exhausted all possible resources and if the child's welfare is being prioritized.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for considering this, given the circumstances. They're in a difficult situation where the child's behavior is beyond their control, and they might need to find an alternative placement for the child's safety and well-being. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
