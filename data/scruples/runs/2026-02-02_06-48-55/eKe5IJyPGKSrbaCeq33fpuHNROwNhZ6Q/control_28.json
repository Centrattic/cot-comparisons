Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me read through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe author and their husband decided to adopt a child from Haiti after the author was found to be infertile. The child is now six and has a history of violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD). They've tried various parenting strategies, therapy, and the child is acting out both at home and school. The author is experiencing physical abuse from the child and is considering giving him back. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for even thinking about returning the child.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what reactive attachment disorder is. RAD is a condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional connections with caregivers, often due to past trauma or neglect. It's a serious disorder that can lead to behavioral issues, which the child here is displaying. The author mentions that therapy helps somewhat, but the effects don't last long. The child is in first grade and at risk of expulsion for violent actions like kicking a teacher and cutting another girl's hair. The parents have tried everything, and the child doesn't seem to respond consistently to their efforts.\n\nNow, the key points here are the parents' efforts, the child's behavior, and the author's emotional and physical state. The parents have invested a lot in trying to help the child, including therapy and adjusting their parenting methods. However, the child's behavior is escalating and is harmful. The author is experiencing physical abuse from the child, which is a serious issue. The parents are not in a position to provide the necessary care and safety, given the child's diagnosed condition.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is in a very difficult position. They made a commitment to adopt the child, which is a lifelong commitment. However, the child's well-being and their own safety are also important. If the child is in a situation where he's harming others or himself, perhaps it's in his best interest to find a more suitable environment. However, the parents might feel guilty for giving him back, especially since he's coming from a background where he may not have had stable care before.\n\nBut the author is considering giving him back because of the physical and emotional toll. They feel they can't continue and that the child doesn't form an emotional bond with them. The question is whether they're in the wrong for even considering that. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the answer here is B (No). The parents have tried their best, and in some cases, it's in the child's best interest to place them in a different environment where they can receive appropriate care. The child has a serious disorder that the current parents might not be able to manage, and the parents' safety is also a concern. The author is not in the wrong for considering returning the child if it's the best option for the child's well-being and their own safety. However, this is a tough decision and should be approached with professional guidance. The parents aren't being negligent; they're making a difficult choice based on their circumstances.\n"
