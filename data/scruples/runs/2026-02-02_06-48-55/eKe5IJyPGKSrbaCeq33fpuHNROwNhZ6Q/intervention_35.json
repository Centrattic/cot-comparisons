Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The story is pretty intense. The couple adopted a child from Haiti who has been acting out with violent behavior, including physical abuse towards the parents. They've tried everything\u2014therapy, different disciplinary methods\u2014but the child is diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to treat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and giving a child back isn't as simple as returning a product. There are legal procedures, the child's welfare, and the parents' rights. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more about moral responsibility.\n\nThe parents adopted the child knowing it might be challenging, but they didn't know about his specific issues. Reactive attachment disorder can be severe, and it's clear they've tried multiple approaches. The child is causing them physical harm and is a risk at school. The parents are exhausted and feeling helpless.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're in a tough situation. They loved the child and tried everything. But the child's behavior is so extreme that it's affecting their safety and the child's education. The parents might feel they can't provide a safe environment anymore. Legally, they might need to go through proper channels to place the child where he can get better support. However, emotionally, it's a hard decision. Society often expects parents to never give up, but realistically, sometimes it's in the child's best interest as well as the parents' to seek help.\n\nOn the other hand, giving a child back could be seen as a failure, but in this case, the parents are doing their best under extremely difficult circumstances. They might not be in the wrong for considering it, especially if they're at risk of harm. However, they should follow legal and ethical adoption procedures, maybe seeking counseling or legal advice before making such a decision. The key point is whether their intention is out of self-interest or the child's best interest. If they're considering the child's well-being and their own ability to care, it's a complex but possibly justified decision. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're in an impossible situation and have tried everything possible.\n"
