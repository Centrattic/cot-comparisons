Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple who adopted a child from Haiti. The child is now six, and they've been dealing with a lot of behavioral issues\u2014violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others, and even physical abuse towards the mother. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The author is considering giving the child back because they're exhausted and can't handle it anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand reactive attachment disorder (RAD). From what I know, RAD is a condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional attachments to caregivers. This can lead to behaviors like those described\u2014acting out, aggression, lack of empathy. It's a serious condition that requires specialized care. The author mentioned they've tried various parenting techniques, therapy, and the child is in therapy, but progress is limited. The child still has significant issues at home and school.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving the child back. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving up a child might seem like a failure or a betrayal. Society often stigmatizes parents who face such challenges and might view giving up as being in the wrong. Also, the child has a right to a stable home, and the parents are making a tough decision that could affect the child's life.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have a right to their own well-being. They're experiencing physical abuse, emotional exhaustion, and the child's behavior is causing significant harm to the family's quality of life. If the child's needs are beyond what the parents can reasonably provide, especially with RAD being a chronic condition, then it might be in the child's best interest to find a more suitable placement where they can receive proper care. The parents might not have the resources or support necessary to manage RAD effectively, leading to a cycle of harm.\n\nBut here's the thing: adoption agencies typically have processes in place for such situations. If the parents have explored all options\u2014therapy, support groups, behavioral interventions\u2014and still find it unmanageable, they might be following the right steps to rehome the child responsibly. It's not just about the parents' capacity but also about the child's welfare. A home that can't provide the necessary environment could be detrimental to the child's development.\n\nHowever, some might argue that giving up a child, especially with a history of being unwanted (as the child was adopted from an environment with many unwanted children), could lead to further trauma and instability. The parents might also feel guilt and societal judgment, which adds to the complexity. The key here is whether the parents are making this decision out of self-interest or the child's best interest. The author mentions feeling guilty and trying to talk themselves out of it, suggesting they're conflicted but possibly prioritizing their well-being and the child's long-term needs.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, I think the parents have a responsibility to ensure the child's safety and their own ability to care for him. If they're in danger and can't provide a stable environment, it's actually ethically responsible to seek help. However, the process should be done through proper channels to ensure the child is placed where he can thrive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. They're making a difficult decision based on their circumstances and the child's condition. The fact that they've tried multiple approaches and are seeking advice suggests they're trying to do the right thing. The answer might be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
