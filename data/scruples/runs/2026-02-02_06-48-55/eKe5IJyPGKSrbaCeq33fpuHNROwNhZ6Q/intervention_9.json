Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post about giving back their adopted son is in the wrong. The story is pretty intense. The adoptive parents adopted a boy from Haiti who's now six, but he has serious behavioral issues, including violence and aggression. They've tried everything\u2014therapy, different parenting styles, but it's not working. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The parents are considering giving him back and feel guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, once a child is legally adopted, the parents have the same rights and responsibilities as biological parents. However, if the adoption is still in a trial period or if there are specific circumstances, they might be able to return the child. But the question isn't about legality; it's about whether the author is morally in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the parents have given this child a home when he was in a difficult situation. They've tried multiple interventions. The child's behavior is extreme and potentially dangerous, not only to them but possibly to others. The parents are experiencing significant emotional and physical harm. The key here is whether they have a moral obligation to keep the child despite the hardships.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition. The parents have done their best, and the situation hasn't improved. The child's actions are violent and uncontrollable, leading to risks of expulsion from school and potential danger to others. The parents' well-being is also a factor here. If they are emotionally and physically exhausted, can they continue to provide a safe environment? \n\nThere's also the aspect of the child's best interest. If the current environment is too stressful or dangerous, maybe returning him to the care of an agency or another family might be safer for him in the long run. However, some might argue that giving up could be seen as a failure, but others would say that the parents have done their part and it's not selfish to seek help or return the child if they can't manage the situation any longer.\n\nThe parents' feelings of guilt are understandable. They might feel they've failed the child, but it's important to recognize that reactive attachment disorder is a complex issue that can be beyond a family's control. The child's behavior isn't a reflection of the parents' love or effort. So, from a moral perspective, is it wrong to prioritize their own safety and well-being when the situation is unmanageable?\n\nIn many cases, professionals might recommend seeking more specialized help or moving to a different care environment, but if all options have been exhausted, the parents might not be in the wrong for considering another path. The decision to return a child isn't taken lightly, especially when it's been a struggle, but it's about protecting themselves and possibly the child from a harmful situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they are considering returning the child due to the child's unmanageable behavior and their own well-being, and they've tried all possible avenues, it's not necessarily in the wrong. The key is whether they've acted in bad faith or neglected the child's needs without trying. Since they've done the opposite, it's more likely they are not in the wrong.\n"
