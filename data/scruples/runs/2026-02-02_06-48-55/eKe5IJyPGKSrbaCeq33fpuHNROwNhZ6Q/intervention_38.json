Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post about wanting to give back their adopted son is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The adoptive parent is an infertile woman and her husband who adopted a boy from Haiti. The child is now six, has behavioral issues, and has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD). The parents have tried various methods to manage his behavior but are facing significant challenges. The mother is considering giving him back due to physical and emotional abuse, feeling exhausted, and the child showing no affection towards her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for considering returning the child? Let's consider the factors. RAD is a serious disorder where the child has difficulty forming emotional attachments. The parents have tried multiple approaches, including therapy, and the child's behavior is escalating. The child's actions are harmful, both to others and the parents. The parents are under immense stress, which affects their well-being.\n\nThe ethical angle here is complex. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but when a child has severe needs that the parents can't manage, it's a tough situation. However, the parents have a responsibility to the child's welfare too. If they can't provide a safe environment, maybe returning him is in his best interest. But if they do, they might be giving up on him. However, the parents are also human and need to consider their mental health and safety.\n\nAnother point is the child's origin. He was adopted from Haiti, which might involve legal and ethical considerations. If they give him back, does that mean he could end up in an institution again? That's a concern. But maybe there's a better support system in his birth country that the parents can access.\n\nThe parents have tried everything they can. The child's behavior is dangerous, and the mother has been physically harmed. It's reasonable to consider that continuing to keep him in such a situation isn't healthy for anyone. The parents have a right to live safely. But also, adoption is a legal and emotional commitment. The question is whether the parents' decision to return him is selfish or necessary.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say the parents should try harder, but given RAD's incurable nature and the severity of the child's actions, it's a realistic challenge. The parents have sought professional help, and the child isn't responding adequately. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parents might not be in the wrong. They are struggling under impossible circumstances. The answer might be B (no), the author is not in the wrong. They're prioritizing their safety and well-being, and the child's needs might be better met elsewhere. However, there's a counter-argument about commitment. But given the situation, B seems more plausible.\n"
