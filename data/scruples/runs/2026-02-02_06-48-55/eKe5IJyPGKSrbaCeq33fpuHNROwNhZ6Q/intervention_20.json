Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband adopted a child from Haiti who has significant behavioral issues. They've tried various methods to manage his behavior, including therapy, but he's been violent and destructive. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to treat. The parents are exhausted and considering returning the child. The author is conflicted and seeking validation.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the well-being of the child and the parents' ability to provide a safe environment. The child is acting out in harmful ways, and the parents feel they can't manage it anymore. They've tried everything they can think of, including professional help. The question is whether it's wrong to consider giving the child back.\n\nOn one hand, the parents adopted this child with the intention of providing a loving home. They've made a commitment. But on the other hand, if they can't ensure the child's safety or their own safety, maybe they have a responsibility to seek help. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that might require specialized care beyond what typical parenting can handle. The parents might not have the resources or support needed, especially given the medical history mentioned (infertility issues, etc.), which could add to their stress.\n\nI need to consider legal aspects too. Adoption is a legal process, and the parents might need to follow specific procedures if they decide to relinquish. But the question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing, not legal. So the focus is on whether the parents are selfish or negligent for considering this.\n\nThe parents are clearly struggling and have tried multiple approaches. They feel they can't cope anymore. The child's behavior is escalating, and they're in danger. Maybe the parents aren't in the wrong because they're trying to protect themselves and possibly the child by getting him into a better care situation. Alternatively, some might argue that giving a child back after adoption is inherently wrong, but others might see it as responsible if the parents can't provide a stable home.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parents are actively seeking help and considering the child's best interest. If they're giving him back to ensure he gets the support he needs, that's not wrong. But if they're just giving up without trying, it could be. However, they've tried everything mentioned. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
