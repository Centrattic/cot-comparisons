Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents adopted a child from Haiti, and the child has been challenging with behavioral issues. They've tried various methods, therapy, but it's not working. The child has even physically hurt them. The author is considering returning the child and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Adoption is a serious commitment, and the parents made a significant effort to adopt, especially when they couldn't have children the traditional way. They've been through a lot, and the child's behavior is causing them physical and emotional harm. Reactive attachment disorder is mentioned, which is a real and complex condition. The parents have exhausted many options, including therapy, but the situation isn't improving.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether giving back a child in this situation is considered the wrong decision. From a legal standpoint, adoption can sometimes be reversed, but it's not straightforward. However, the question here is more about moral or emotional wrongdoing.\n\nThe parents have tried everything. The child's actions are violent and destructive, creating a dangerous environment. The author is not choosing to abandon the child but is considering returning him to protect their own well-being and possibly for the child's benefit if he can get better care elsewhere. In many cases, parents might be encouraged to seek more resources or support, but if all options have been tried and the situation remains harmful, it's a tough call.\n\nThere's a balance between the parents' responsibility and their own mental and physical health. The author is clearly struggling and feels like they're doing everything right but can't cope anymore. Society often praises perseverance, but there's also understanding for the need to prioritize one's safety. The child might need specialized care that the parents can't provide, and in that case, giving him back might be in his best interest as well.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've done their best, the situation is beyond their control, and they're seeking help. The answer is B.\n"
