Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the adoptive parents have a six-year-old from Haiti. They adopted because the mother is infertile. The child has been challenging with violent outbursts, destructive behavior, and aggression toward the parents. He's been in therapy for a year and a half, but the behavior at home and school is bad. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which isn't curable. The parents are considering giving him back due to exhaustion and the toll it's taking on them.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. So, the factors here include the parents' well-being, the child's needs, the legal and ethical aspects of adoption, and the availability of support systems. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, adoption is a binding commitment, but there might be options like legal guardianship or reunification in some cases. However, the parents might be considering termination of their parental rights. Ethically, they need to consider the child's best interest. If the child is being abusive and they can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's in his interest to be placed elsewhere. However, the parents are also suffering emotionally and physically, which is a valid concern.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition. The parents have tried various methods\u2014therapy, discipline, etc.\u2014and it's not working. They're not negligent; they've made efforts. But the situation is deteriorating. The key point is whether they're being selfish or if it's a reasonable decision given the circumstances.\n\nIn many AITA discussions, the community often looks at intentions and efforts. The parents here are clearly trying their best but are overwhelmed. They might not be in the wrong if they're making this decision for the child's welfare and their own ability to function. However, some might argue that they should try more options before giving up. But given the severity of the behavior and the diagnosis, it's a tough call.\n\nI think the answer leans toward B (not in the wrong) because they've made a conscious effort and are considering their limits, which is understandable. The well-being of both the child and the parents is important. If they can't provide a safe environment, it's not necessarily wrong to seek a better solution for everyone involved.\n"
