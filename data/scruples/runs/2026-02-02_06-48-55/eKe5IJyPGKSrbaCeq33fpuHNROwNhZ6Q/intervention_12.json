Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The scenario describes a family who adopted a 6-year-old boy from Haiti. He has behavioral issues, including violent tantrums, aggression, and destructive behavior. They've tried various methods, therapy, and he's been diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD). The parent feels exhausted and is considering giving him back but is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what Reactive Attachment Disorder is. RAD is a condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional connections with others, often due to past trauma, neglect, or unstable caregiving. The symptoms include emotional withdrawal, lack of responsiveness to comfort, and sometimes behavioral issues. The fact that he's been diagnosed with RAD is important because it's a recognized medical condition that affects his behavior.\n\nThe parents have tried multiple approaches\u2014firmness, softness, discipline, therapy. The child does better with the therapist but the behavior at home and school is severe. The parent mentions being physically hurt by the child. The parent is struggling emotionally and physically, feeling like they can't handle it anymore.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong for considering returning the child. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nAdoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also a legal and emotional process. However, the parent's well-being and safety are also important. If the child is causing harm, whether physical or emotional, there might be a responsibility to ensure his needs are met in a way that's sustainable. Sometimes, when a family can't meet a child's needs due to severe behavioral issues, it might be in the child's best interest to find another placement. However, returning an adopted child can be complex legally and emotionally.\n\nBut the parent is considering returning the child because they're exhausted and can't handle it. Is that selfish? Or is it a necessary step for their own mental health and safety? Also, the child has been in their care for three years, and they've tried everything. The parent has done their best to provide care and support, but the situation is deteriorating. The fact that he's in first grade and at risk of expulsion suggests that he needs more specialized care, which the family might not be equipped to provide.\n\nOn the other hand, giving him back might not be the only option. Maybe there's a possibility of finding a more specialized program or another adoptive family who can manage his needs better. However, the parent might not have the resources or support to explore those options. The parent's safety and mental health are critical factors here. If the child is physically abusive, that's a red flag for the parent's safety.\n\nReactive Attachment Disorder is a challenging diagnosis. The parent's efforts to provide therapy and discipline show they've tried to address the issues. The key point is whether the parent is in the wrong for considering giving him back. If the parent is acting in their own self-interest due to exhaustion, that could be seen as selfish. However, if the parent is in a situation where they can no longer safely care for the child and can't access adequate support, it might be a necessary decision for the child's welfare as well.\n\nIn some cases, even with the best intentions, a family might not be the right fit for a child with complex needs. It's a tough situation, but the parent's emotional and physical well-being matters. The parent might not be in the wrong if they're making the decision based on the child's needs and their own inability to sustain the care required. However, if the decision is purely based on the parent's inability to handle stress without considering the child's needs, then they might be in the wrong. But given the child's diagnosis and the parent's efforts, it's a complex scenario where the parent's decision could be seen as a difficult but necessary choice.\n"
