Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the couple adopted a boy from Haiti when he was three. He's six now and has a lot of behavioral issues\u2014tantrums, violence, destruction. They've tried everything, therapy, different parenting techniques. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The mom is experiencing physical abuse from the kid, and it's affecting school too. She's emotionally and physically exhausted, considering giving him back but feels guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal aspects. Adoption in the U.S. is usually final, so reversing it might be complicated. But the question isn't about legality but moral/ethical wrong. The user wants to know if the author is at fault for even thinking about this.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They adopted with good intentions, but the child has severe issues. The key points are that the child is causing harm, they've tried all possible interventions, and the diagnosis is chronic. The mother is being abused physically and emotionally. \n\nSome might argue that they should stick it out, but others might say it's in everyone's best interest to seek help. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition. The child might need more specialized care than they can provide. Also, the safety of the parents matters. If the child is physically abusive, that's a concern for their well-being too.\n\nIs the mother selfish for considering giving him back? Or is she being realistic? The question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if they can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's right to find a better fit. But adoption is a lifelong commitment, so some might see it as abandoning the child. However, the child's behavior is dangerous and harmful. Maybe the parents are doing the right thing by trying to find a placement where he can get the needed care.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's acted in good faith, tried everything possible, and the situation is causing harm. Given the diagnosis, it's a chronic issue, and she's prioritizing her safety and the child's well-being by seeking a better placement. It's a tragic situation, but not her fault.\n"
