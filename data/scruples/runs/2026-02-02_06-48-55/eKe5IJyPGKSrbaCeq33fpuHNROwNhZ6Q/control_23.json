Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an adopted son who has been very challenging to raise. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, and have faced a lot of physical and emotional abuse from the child. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which is mentioned as untreatable. The author is considering giving the child back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The parents adopted the child with the best intentions, knowing the child had issues. They've tried everything\u2014therapy, different parenting styles, removing potential hazards from his room. The child's behavior is destructive and violent, leading to possible expulsion from school and physical harm to the parents. The disorder is a significant factor here; reactive attachment disorder can make forming emotional bonds difficult, and it's a chronic condition.\n\nThe parents are clearly in a very stressful and dangerous situation. They feel exhausted and are considering giving the child back to protect themselves and possibly find a more suitable environment for him. The question is whether they are in the wrong for considering this. \n\nAdoption is a big commitment, but it's also supposed to be in the best interest of the child. However, if the child's needs are too overwhelming and the parents can't meet them, it might be in the child's best interest to find another home. Also, the parents' well-being matters. They shouldn't be in a situation where they're regularly harmed. \n\nSome might argue that giving up is not responsible, but others would say that sometimes it's the most responsible choice when the situation is unsafe and not improving. The key points here are the child's diagnosis, the efforts made, the dangerous behavior, and the parents' safety and mental health. \n\nI think the parents are not in the wrong. They've done their best, and given the child's condition and the severity of the issues, it's a valid consideration. The answer should be B.\n"
