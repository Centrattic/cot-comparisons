Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone considering giving back their adopted son, so it's a tough one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple adopted a child from Haiti who is now six. The child has been violent and difficult, with diagnoses like reactive attachment disorder. They've tried everything\u2014therapy, different parenting approaches, but the child's behavior is getting worse. The parents are physically and emotionally exhausted.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving the child back.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has trouble forming healthy emotional bonds. It's not something they can just fix, and it can lead to aggressive and destructive behavior. The parents have tried all the recommended strategies, but the child's actions are harmful and escalating. They're being hurt physically, and the child is also in danger of being expelled from school.\n\nNow, the ethical angle here is tricky. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but the parents are clearly struggling. The child's well-being is a concern too. If the parents can't provide a safe and stable environment, maybe the child would benefit from being in a different setting. However, the parents also have a duty to protect themselves and their other family members from harm.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty for even considering this. They mention they're trying to talk themselves out of it, but the stress is overwhelming. It's possible that they feel like they're failing the child by even thinking about giving him up, but if they're unable to meet his needs and their own safety is at risk, it's a hard decision.\n\nIn some cases, when a child's behavior is so severe that it endangers others, it might be in the child's best interest to be placed elsewhere. But the parents are supposed to be his primary caregivers, so this is a very difficult situation. The parents might not be in the wrong for considering their own well-being and the child's potential safety in a different environment. However, they need to explore all possible options first, like seeking more specialized help or considering other support systems.\n\nBut in this scenario, they've already tried multiple approaches, therapy, and the child's behavior hasn't improved. The parents are being physically harmed, which is a serious issue. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for considering giving the child back, especially if it's in the child's best interest. But I'm not entirely sure. It's a complex situation with no clear right answer, but the key points are the child's well-being, the parents' safety, and the ethical responsibility of the adoption commitment.\n"
