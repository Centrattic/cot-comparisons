Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. Let me start by reading through the situation again to get all the details.\n\nThe author and their husband decided to adopt because the wife is infertile and surrogacy isn't an option. They adopted a three-year-old boy from Haiti. Now he's six, and he has serious behavioral issues\u2014violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others, and even physical abuse towards the mother. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which I think is a condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional attachments. The author is considering giving him back and is asking if they're in the wrong for even thinking about it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications. The child was adopted, so there's a legal and emotional commitment involved. The parents have tried various approaches: therapy, discipline methods, etc. The child's behavior is harmful and causing trauma to the parents. On one hand, adoption is supposed to be permanent, and giving the child up might seem like an abandonment. But on the other hand, the parents are in a situation where they can't provide a safe environment, and the child's behavior is severely impacting their well-being.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a real issue. Children with RAD have trouble forming bonds and might act out because of their history of neglect or abuse. The child was three when adopted, so maybe he had a traumatic past before being adopted. The parents are doing their best but are exhausted and physically harmed. It's a tough situation. \n\nIs it the parents' responsibility to keep the child no matter what? Or is it okay to consider their own well-being and safety? The parents are trying everything, but if the situation is untenable and they're being physically abused, maybe they have a right to seek help or consider other options. However, they might also have a responsibility to find alternative solutions before giving up, like more therapy, special education, or other support systems. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong for considering returning the child. If they're in a situation where they can't provide a safe environment, maybe it's not their fault. They might be doing the \"right\" thing to protect themselves and others, even if it's a hard decision. However, adoption agencies usually have resources and support for such cases. Did the parents exhaust all possible help before considering this? The author mentions they've tried therapy for over a year and a half, but maybe there are other options.\n\nBut the physical abuse is a critical factor. If the parents are being harmed, it's a safety issue. In such cases, it's possible that the child needs more specialized care, and the parents might not be equipped to handle it. However, giving the child back could be seen as a last resort if all other options are exhausted. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a complex question. The parents are doing everything they can, but the situation is overwhelming. Their intention isn't to abandon the child but to protect themselves and possibly find a better environment for the child. On the other hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, so considering giving up might seem like a failure. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the situation is extremely challenging, and their well-being is at risk. They've tried numerous interventions and the child's needs are beyond their current capacity. It's not a simple right or wrong issue, but given the circumstances, it's understandable they would consider this option.\n"
