Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The adoptive parents have an adopted son from Haiti who's been challenging since they got him. He's six, has reactive attachment disorder, and has behavioral issues at home and school. The mom is being physically abused by the child and is considering giving him back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents decided to adopt because the mother is infertile, which shows they wanted a family through the most selfless route, as they mentioned. They've tried various methods to help the child, like therapy, different parenting strategies. The child's behavior is really difficult, and the mom is emotionally and physically exhausted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants others' opinions. \n\nI should think about the parents' duty of care. They have a legal responsibility to provide a safe environment. If they can't do that, giving the child back might be necessary. Also, the child has a right to be in a stable environment. But the parents' well-being matters too. Are they giving up too easily? Or is this a realistic decision considering the circumstances?\n\nReactive attachment disorder is hard to manage. They've tried therapy, but maybe there's no cure. If the parents are being physically harmed, it's a safety issue. But also, the child might need more specialized care. Maybe they should seek out more resources before giving up? Or maybe it's not giving up\u2014it's making a hard choice for the good of everyone involved. \n\nThe parents love the child but can't handle the situation anymore. The author is feeling guilty for even thinking about giving him back. But is that guilt misplaced? If the parents can't provide the necessary care, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a tough decision, but it's not straightforward. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The parents are making a difficult choice under extreme stress and have tried multiple approaches. Their well-being and safety are also important. The child might need a different environment where he can get better support. Even though it's a hard decision, it's not necessarily wrong.\n"
