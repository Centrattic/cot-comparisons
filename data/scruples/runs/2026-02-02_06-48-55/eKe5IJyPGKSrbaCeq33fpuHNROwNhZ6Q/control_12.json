Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they adopted a child from Haiti, and now they're considering giving him back because of his behavioral issues. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to treat. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, but the kid is violent and destructive. They're physically and emotionally exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider adoption laws. In most places, once a child is legally adopted, returning them isn't as simple as giving them back. There's usually a process, maybe involving the court or social services. So maybe the author is thinking about terminating the adoption or seeking another placement. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong morally, not legally.\n\nMoral aspect: The parents made a commitment to adopt this child. They went through a long process and knew adoption can be challenging. But they also took on the responsibility with open eyes. On the other hand, the child has serious emotional and behavioral issues that are affecting the parents' well-being and safety. The parents are being physically harmed by the child. \n\nAdoption agencies often screen for possible issues, but maybe the parents weren't prepared for the extent of the child's problems. Reactive attachment disorder is a significant challenge. The parents have tried everything: therapy, different parenting approaches. But the child's behavior is escalating. \n\nNow, the dilemma is whether the parents have a right to consider giving the child back if they can no longer cope, even if it's in their best interest. Some might argue that they have a responsibility to provide a safe and loving home, while others might say that their well-being is also important. The child's best interest is a key factor. If the parents can't manage, maybe the child could be placed in a more suitable environment. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they're considering giving the child back due to their own exhaustion and the child's unmanageable behavior, is that selfish? Or is it realistic? Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but if the circumstances are too overwhelming, maybe it's not in the child's best interest to stay in an unstable home. However, if the parents genuinely tried everything and still can't handle it, maybe it's a valid decision. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the parents are struggling with severe, untreated issues that they've tried to address. Their safety and ability to care for the child are compromised. However, this is a tough call. Some might say they should never give up, but the reality is that in such cases, professional help and alternative placements might be necessary. The key is whether they've exhausted all options and if the child's needs can be met elsewhere.\n"
