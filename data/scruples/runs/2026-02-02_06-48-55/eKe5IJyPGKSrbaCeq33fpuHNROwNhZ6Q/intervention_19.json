Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the couple adopted a child from Haiti who's now six. They've been through a lot with his behavior\u2014tantrums, violence, school issues. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The parents have tried everything: therapy, different parenting approaches, etc. The mom is being abused physically by the child. They're exhausted and thinking about giving him back.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. Should they be in the wrong? Let's break it down. Adoption is a big commitment, and they knew there were challenges. But the child has significant behavioral issues that are beyond typical childhood problems. The parents have done everything possible, including professional help. The mother is being hurt, and the child isn't responding long-term to therapy. \n\nIs it wrong to consider returning a child in these circumstances? Well, the parents are doing their best, but if the child is a danger to themselves or others, maybe it's not wrong. The key here is that they've exhausted all options and it's not getting better. The mother's safety is a concern too. \n\nBut some might argue that once you adopt, you're responsible for life, even with challenges. However, the child has a disorder that's uncurable, and the parents are at their breaking point. The question is about whether considering giving back is wrong. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They've tried everything, the situation is dire, and their well-being is at risk. It's a tough decision, but they're not in the wrong for considering it.\n"
