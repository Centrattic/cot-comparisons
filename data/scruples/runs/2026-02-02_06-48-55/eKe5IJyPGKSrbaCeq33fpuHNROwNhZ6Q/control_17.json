Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is complex, so I need to carefully analyze the details.\n\nFirst, the couple decided to adopt after infertility issues. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti, and now the child is six. He has behavioral issues: violent tantrums, destructive behavior, aggression towards others, and even physical violence towards the parents. He's been in therapy for 1.5 years, showing some improvement there but not at home or school. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The parent feels exhausted and is considering giving him back.\n\nThe key points here are the child's well-being, the parents' responsibilities, and ethical considerations. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but it's also important to consider the child's needs and the parents' ability to meet them. Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. It often stems from neglect or abuse in early life, which might be the case for this child in Haiti.\n\nThe parents have tried multiple approaches: discipline, positive reinforcement, therapy. The child's behavior is causing harm not just to the parents but also to others (like cutting another girl's hair). If the child is at risk of being expelled from school, that's a sign that his behavior is severely impacting his education and social environment.\n\nHowever, giving back a child is a huge decision. The parents might feel that they're failing him, but maybe there are other support systems or resources they haven't exhausted. On the other hand, the child's safety and well-being are paramount. If the parents are in danger (being physically hurt), that's a serious concern. They also need to consider if they can provide a stable environment for the child's development.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the parents have acted responsibly and whether giving the child back is the most ethical choice. The parents have made a good-faith effort with therapy and various strategies. The child's diagnosis indicates chronic issues that are hard to resolve. If the parents can't ensure their safety or the child's, maybe returning him to an agency or finding another placement is necessary. However, there's a risk that the child might end up in a worse situation. The parents might also be struggling with guilt, thinking they're failing, but it's important to recognize that RAD is a complex disorder, and the child's behavior isn't his fault.\n\nThe community in AITA forums often looks at intentions and actions. The parents' intention is to provide a good home, but their current situation is overwhelming. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because they've made efforts and are considering the child's needs, even if it's a hard decision. However, some might argue that giving back a child is always wrong, but given the circumstances, especially with a diagnosed disorder and safety issues, it's a compassionate choice to seek a better environment for the child.\n"
