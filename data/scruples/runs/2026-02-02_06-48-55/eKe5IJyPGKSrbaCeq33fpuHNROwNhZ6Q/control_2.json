Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and their husband tried adoption because of infertility. They adopted a boy from Haiti, but he has behavioral issues. He's been violent, destructive, and the parents are struggling with his behavior despite therapy. The child has reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The parents are exhausted and considering giving him back.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. The key factors here are their intentions and the circumstances. They adopted with the best intentions, but now they're overwhelmed. The child has significant emotional and behavioral challenges. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, etc., but it's not working. They're not doing this out of malice but out of exhaustion and the child's needs.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition. The parents have been caring for him, providing for him, but the child isn't bonding. The parents' well-being is also a factor. They're physically and emotionally drained. It's important to consider that giving him back might be in the child's best interest if the parents can't provide the necessary care anymore. Also, adoption processes usually have options for returning the child if it's not working out, which is a legal and ethical consideration.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that they should stick it out because they made a commitment. But considering the severity of the disorder and the lack of progress, this could be unrealistic. The parents are doing their best, and it's not a case of neglect. They're seeking help and have tried everything. The child's safety and the parents' mental health are both important.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're facing a tough situation with a child who has complex needs. Their decision isn't based on dislike but on the reality of the circumstances. It's a compassionate choice to seek a better environment for the child if they can't provide it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
