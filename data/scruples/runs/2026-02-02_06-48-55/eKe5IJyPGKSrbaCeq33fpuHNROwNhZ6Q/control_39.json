Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple adopted a child from Haiti who is now six. He has behavioral issues, has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and is causing physical and emotional harm to the mother. They've tried various methods, but nothing seems to work. The mother is considering returning him but feels guilty about it.\n\nNow, determining if she's in the wrong. The key factors here are the child's well-being, the parents' capabilities, and legal/ethical considerations. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that affects how a child forms relationships. The parents have done their best with therapy and different parenting techniques, but the situation is deteriorating. They're experiencing physical harm and emotional exhaustion.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, adoption usually requires the consent of the adoptive parents, and in some cases, they might be able to return the child, especially if they're not in a position to care for him safely. Ethically, the parents have a duty to protect their child and themselves. If the child is in danger or if the parents can't provide a safe environment, returning him might be necessary. However, there's also a responsibility to ensure that the child is placed in a better situation, not just given up out of desperation.\n\nBut the author is struggling with guilt, thinking that good people don't consider returning a child. However, this is a complex situation where the parents might be prioritizing their own well-being and the child's safety. It's important to note that the mother is being physically abused by the child, which is a serious issue. Continuing to keep the child in a harmful environment could be harmful to both the parents and the child. The parents might need to consider other options, like seeking more specialized help, but if that's not feasible, returning the child could be a last resort to ensure safety.\n\nI should also consider if there are support systems they haven't tried yet. Maybe intensive therapy, behavioral programs, or other resources. However, the scenario states that they've tried various methods and therapy for over a year and a half. The child's behavior is escalating despite these efforts. The mother is in a vulnerable position, so it's not a simple decision. \n\nIn terms of moral wrongness, the author isn't inherently in the wrong for considering the child's return. They're in a difficult situation where their well-being and safety are at stake. It's a tough call, but the priority is to prevent further harm. The answer would likely be B (No), because the parents aren't in the wrong for trying to protect themselves and ensure the child's safety, even if it means returning him.\n"
