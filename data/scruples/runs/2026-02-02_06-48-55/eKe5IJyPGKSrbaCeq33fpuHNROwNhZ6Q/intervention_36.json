Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her husband adopted a three-year-old boy from Haiti. Now he's six. He has behavioral issues, including violent tantrums, destructive behavior, and even physical aggression towards them. They've tried various methods to manage his behavior, therapy, but with limited success. He's been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. The author is considering giving him back because she's exhausted and the child doesn't seem to reciprocate love.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the parents have made a significant commitment through adoption, which is a lifelong responsibility. They've invested time, money, and emotional energy. The child's behavior is challenging, but it's also due to his attachment disorder, which might stem from his early life experiences in Haiti. The parents might feel overwhelmed, and it's natural to feel that way. However, giving a child back could be traumatic for him again. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents need to consider the child's well-being. If they can't provide a safe environment, it might be in the child's best interest to seek another home where he can get the necessary support. But they've already tried multiple interventions without success. The key points here are the child's mental health, the parents' ability to cope, and the ethical considerations of adoption. \n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition. The parents might not have the resources or support system to handle it effectively. If they decide to give him back, they might be making the best decision for the child's future, even though it's painful. However, if there's a possibility of finding alternative solutions, like specialized care or family support, maybe they should explore those first. \n\nBut the parents have already tried many approaches. The author mentions that therapy helps but the effects don't last. The child is at risk of expulsion from school and has already exhibited dangerous behaviors. The parents are experiencing physical abuse from their own child. These are extreme circumstances. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they choose to return the child, they might be making a difficult but necessary decision for everyone's safety and well-being. However, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving up might be seen as abandoning the child. But in this case, the parents are facing significant challenges that they can't manage, and they might believe it's for the child's good. \n\nThe ethical dilemma here is complex. The parents' well-being is also important. They can't function as a family if they're in constant danger. But the child also needs a stable environment. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they're considering the child's needs and their own inability to care for him effectively. \n\nI think the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a tough choice under difficult circumstances, prioritizing the well-being of everyone involved. However, they should ensure that any decision is made in the child's best interest, perhaps with professional guidance.\n"
