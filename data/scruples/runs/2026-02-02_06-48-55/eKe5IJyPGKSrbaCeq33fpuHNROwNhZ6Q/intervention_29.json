Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author who wants to give back their adopted son is in the wrong. The situation involves significant challenges with the child's behavior, including physical aggression, destruction, and emotional detachment. The parents have tried various strategies and therapy, but progress is limited. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is difficult to manage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, and parents have rights and responsibilities. However, in cases of severe behavioral issues that pose risks to the child's well-being or others, there might be legal options beyond just returning the child. The parents might need to explore other avenues like specialized foster care or behavioral interventions before deciding to terminate the adoption.\n\nEmotionally, the parents are clearly struggling. They've invested a lot and are experiencing physical and emotional harm. But as adoptive parents, they made a commitment. The key here is whether they've exhausted all possible resources and support systems. The child's well-being is also a factor. If the environment is harmful, it's in the child's best interest to find a more suitable placement.\n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a complex condition. It requires consistent, skilled care. The parents might not have the necessary training or resources, which could contribute to their decision. However, they should consult with professionals to explore all options. Terminating the adoption isn't a decision to be made lightly. There's also the aspect of the child's right to stability and continuity, especially given the age and the history of being unwanted.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have a right to their own safety and mental health. They shouldn't be in a situation where they're being physically harmed. If they've tried everything and it's not working, they might not be in the wrong, but the process should involve professional guidance and legal considerations.\n\nI need to balance the parents' rights with the child's needs. The answer might hinge on whether they've done all they can and if there are alternative solutions. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if that's accurate.\n"
