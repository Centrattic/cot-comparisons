Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they adopted a son from Haiti when he was three. He's six now and has been acting out a lot\u2014tantrums, violence, even damaging things. They've tried different parenting approaches and therapy. The kid has reactive attachment disorder, which isn't curable. The author is considering giving him back.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, adopting a child is a big commitment, and they've already made the choice to adopt. They've put in a lot of effort with therapy and different methods. But the child's behavior is escalating, and it's affecting the author's well-being. They're physically and emotionally exhausted. \n\nReactive attachment disorder is a real condition that can make bonding difficult. The child doesn't show affection and acts out. The parents might feel like they're doing everything they can, but maybe it's not enough. Are they obligated to keep the child despite the challenges? Or is it okay to consider their own and the child's well-being?\n\nSometimes, in cases of severe behavioral issues, it might be in the child's best interest to be placed in a facility with more resources. But giving him back could also be traumatic for the child. However, the parents might not have the means or support to handle it. The author feels they're doing everything right but can't handle it anymore. \n\nI think the key is whether they're in the wrong. The author didn't abandon the child; they're seeking advice because they're struggling. The situation is complex, and while they made a commitment, their health and the child's future are also important. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
