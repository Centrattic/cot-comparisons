Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her husband adopted a child from Haiti. The boy is now six, has been challenging, with behavioral issues, and has been violent towards them. They've tried various methods, therapy, but it's not working. The child has RAD, which is Reactive Attachment Disorder. The author is considering giving him back but feels guilty.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong? Let's break it down. Adoption is a big commitment, and they knew it wouldn't be easy. They chose adoption selflessly, but now they're struggling. The child's behavior is severe\u2014physical abuse towards them. They've exhausted options. The key points here are the child's well-being, the parents' safety, and whether they're providing a good environment.\n\nRAD is a disorder where kids have trouble forming attachments. It's hard to manage, especially in a young child. The parents have tried everything. But the child is aggressive, damaging their home, school problems. The parents are physically harmed. They might not be able to provide a safe home anymore. \n\nOn one hand, giving a child back is a tough choice. But on the other, if the child is in a harmful environment, maybe it's better for them to be in a place where they can get the right support. The parents are also suffering. The author isn't being negligent; they're trying but can't handle it anymore. \n\nLegal and ethical considerations: If they're in danger, they might need to involve authorities, but if they decide to return him, that's a personal choice. However, adoption is legally binding, so they'd need to go through the proper channels. Also, the child's best interest should be a priority. If there's no improvement, and the current environment is harmful, maybe it's better for the child to be in a facility or another home where they can receive specialized care.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for considering it? Well, they made a commitment, but sometimes circumstances make it impossible to fulfill. They're not mistreating the child; they're trying. The guilt is there, but they're at their breaking point. So, probably not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
