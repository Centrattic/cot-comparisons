Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The parents are dealing with a child who has reactive attachment disorder, causing physical abuse and behavioral issues. They've tried everything, therapy, different parenting styles, but it's not working. The author is struggling with whether they're a bad person for even thinking about giving the child back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Adoption is a lifelong commitment, but the child has significant emotional and behavioral challenges. The parents have made a lot of sacrifices, including dealing with the child's violent outbursts and the stress of potential expulsion from school. They've exhausted various methods, and the therapist isn't helping at home. The child's behavior is harmful, and the parents are physically and emotionally drained.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is understanding the circumstances. The parents are not choosing this lightly. They've tried everything possible. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition that can make bonding extremely difficult. The parents are considering returning the child not out of malice, but because they can't cope anymore and want to protect themselves and possibly the child from a harmful situation.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once a child is adopted, the parents should not give up. But the reality is that sometimes the situation is beyond the parents' control, especially when there are mental health issues involved. The parents are in a position where they're at risk of harm, and continuing to keep the child might be detrimental to both the child and the family. It's also possible that the child would benefit from a different environment where they can receive more specialized care.\n\nAnother angle is the child's well-being. If the parents can't provide the necessary support, the child might be better off in a setting that can handle their needs, even if it means another adoption. The parents' decision could be in the best interest of the child if they're unable to provide a safe and stable home.\n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. The parents love the child and have tried everything. Feeling like they're in the wrong might stem from societal expectations about parenthood. However, the author's primary concern is their own safety and the child's safety. It's a difficult situation where there's no easy answer. The parents are not being negligent; they're overwhelmed and seeking help.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are not in the wrong. They're dealing with a complex situation that's causing them significant distress. Their decision to consider returning the child is a last resort after exhausting all options. It's about finding a solution that can provide stability and safety for everyone involved.\n"
