Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering giving back their adopted son. The situation is pretty intense. The child has been acting out with violent behaviors, causing physical harm to the parent, and has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. The parents have tried various methods, therapy, but it's not working well enough.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what reactive attachment disorder (RAD) entails. From what I know, RAD is a condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds with caregivers. It's often due to neglect or instability in early life. Children with RAD might exhibit challenging behaviors, emotional dysregulation, and lack of social connections. The parents here have done a lot, including therapy, but the child is still acting out.\n\nThe parents adopted the child from Haiti when he was three. That age could complicate attachment issues, especially if he had early trauma. The child's actions are severe: physical aggression, destruction, and even risking expulsion from school. The mother has been physically harmed multiple times. The husband is mentioned as being more boisterous, so maybe the child responds differently to him, but the mother's experience is worse.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author (the mother) is in the wrong for considering returning the child. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not). \n\nI need to consider the ethical and practical aspects. On one hand, adoption is a lifelong commitment, and giving back a child might feel like a failure. But on the other hand, the child's and parents' well-being matters. If the child is in a harmful environment and the parents can't provide the necessary care, perhaps returning him is in his best interest. Also, the child might need specialized care or a different environment that the parents can't provide.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the parents' rights and the child's rights. In many cases, once a child is adopted, returning them isn't as simple as returning a product. Legal processes are involved. However, in some cases, especially when there are issues like abuse or neglect, the court might intervene. But in this case, the parents are considering it voluntarily.\n\nThe mother is feeling exhausted and harmed, which is a significant factor. Her safety and mental health are at risk. If she's in danger, then she's not in the wrong for considering steps to protect herself. However, the child's needs must also be considered. If he's sent back, maybe to foster care or an institution, but that could be better for his behavioral issues if they have the resources there.\n\nBut in some adoption systems, especially intercountry adoptions, returning a child might involve legal hurdles. The parents might be bound by the terms of the adoption, but if the child has special needs, maybe there's a provision. Also, the child's country of origin might have different regulations.\n\nThe key points here are the child's well-being, the parents' well-being, and the feasibility of the parents continuing care. The mother is considering it because she's physically and emotionally harmed. The child's behavior is not improving enough to make the situation manageable. The parents have tried everything. So, is it wrong to consider giving him back?\n\nIn many cases, people might argue that the parents should make every effort to support the child, but when those efforts have failed and there's ongoing harm, it's a different story. It's a tough situation, but the mother isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect herself and her family. The answer might be B, no, she's not in the wrong. However, there's also the aspect of the child's right to permanency. If returning him means he might go through more instability, that's a concern. But if the current environment is dangerous, then maybe it's better for him too. \n\nI think the consensus here would lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong. She's in a difficult situation where she's exhausted, harmed, and the child's needs are beyond what they can handle. Considering all the efforts they've made and the lack of improvement, her decision isn't wrong.\n"
