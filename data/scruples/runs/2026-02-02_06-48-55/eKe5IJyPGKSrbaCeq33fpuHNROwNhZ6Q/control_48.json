Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is an adoptive parent who tried to have kids through IVF but couldn't. They adopted a three-year-old from Haiti. Now the kid is six and acting out with violent behavior at home and school. He's been in therapy for over a year, but things aren't getting better. The parent has been physically hurt by the child. They mention that the child has reactive attachment disorder (RAD), which is hard to cure. The parent is considering giving the child back but feels guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects of adoption. When someone adopts a child, especially internationally, there might be specific legal procedures for returning the child. I don't know if the parent is following those steps, but the question is whether they're morally wrong for wanting to give the child back, not necessarily about the legality.\n\nEmotionally, the parent is clearly struggling. They've tried everything\u2014firmness, softness, discipline, therapy. The child's behavior is causing them physical harm and emotional stress. The child isn't responding well to their efforts, and the parent feels they can't provide a safe environment. \n\nReactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. The parent might have been led to believe that adoption would be fulfilling, but the reality is challenging. The parent's well-being is also important. If they're being harmed physically and emotionally, it's a valid concern for their own health and safety.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once you adopt a child, you're responsible for their life. But the parent adopted with good intentions and is dealing with unforeseen circumstances. They've sought professional help, which shows they're trying. The child's needs might be beyond their capacity to meet, especially with RAD.\n\nAnother angle: the child's best interest. If the parent can't provide a safe environment, maybe the child would be better off in another home where they can get the right support. The parent might not have the resources or resilience to handle this long-term. However, the parent could be feeling this way due to exhaustion, which is a common issue in parenting challenging children.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? If the parent is considering returning the child through proper channels, they're not necessarily wrong. They might be making a hard decision for the sake of their own well-being and the child's, if another placement can offer better support. But it's a tough call. They might also be feeling guilty because they invested so much emotionally. The key is whether the decision is in the child's best interest and the parent's ability to cope.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't in the wrong. They've made a difficult decision under trying circumstances. They've given it their all, and considering the child's diagnosis and the lack of progress, it might be in everyone's best interest. So the answer is B.\n"
