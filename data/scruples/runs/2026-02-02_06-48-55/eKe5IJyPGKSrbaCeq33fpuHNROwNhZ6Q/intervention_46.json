Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent considering giving back their adopted son due to severe behavioral issues. The author has tried various methods, therapy, and the child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to give the child back.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents adopted a child from Haiti who is now six and has been acting out with violent tantrums, aggression, and destructive behavior. They've tried multiple approaches, and the child isn't responding well. The author is considering giving the child back but feels guilty about it.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The key points here are the child's well-being, the parents' responsibilities, and the ethical considerations of adoption. \n\nReactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a serious condition where a child has difficulty forming emotional bonds. It's not the parent's fault, and the child might have had a traumatic background before adoption. The parents have made significant efforts to help the child, including therapy. However, the child's behavior is escalating, and the parents are experiencing physical abuse. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, giving a child back is a last resort. However, if the child is in a harmful environment and the parents can't manage the behavior, it might be in the child's best interest to find a more suitable placement. The parents are exhausted and at their breaking point, which can affect their ability to provide care. \n\nBut adoption is a lifelong commitment. The parents did know about the possibility of challenges when they adopted. However, RAD is a long-term issue. If the parents can't provide a safe environment, then the child might be better off in another home where the parents can manage the condition. On the flip side, the parents have a responsibility to try everything possible before giving up, including more intensive therapy or other resources.\n\nThe author is considering this because they can't cope anymore. The question is whether it's morally wrong. Some might argue that the parents should persevere, but others might say that the child needs a stable, safe environment, even if that means another family. The parents have tried their best, and if they can't continue, it's better for the child's safety and well-being. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the perspective. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the parents are making a decision out of genuine concern for the child's well-being and their own ability to care for him, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if they're giving up too easily, then perhaps they are. The situation is complex, and without more information, it's hard to say. But given that they've tried everything and the child's behavior is dangerous, it might not be their fault. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
