Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to give back their adopted son. The story is pretty intense. The couple adopted a three-year-old from Haiti who now has attachment disorder and is causing a lot of problems at home and school. They've tried various methods, therapy, etc., but it's not working. The parent is considering giving him back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Adoption is a legal process, so giving back a child isn't as simple as returning a product. They might need to go through legal channels, which could be complicated. But the question isn't about the process, it's about whether they're in the wrong morally.\n\nThe parent is dealing with a lot of trauma and stress. The child has been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is a real condition that makes it hard for the child to form emotional bonds. The parent is experiencing physical abuse from the child, which is a serious issue. They've tried everything: therapy, different parenting techniques, but nothing's working long-term. The parent feels exhausted and maybe even guilty for considering giving the child back.\n\nOn one hand, the child was adopted with the intention of providing a loving home, and the parent has made significant efforts to support the child. They might feel they've failed, but they're also in a tough spot where they can't provide the necessary environment for the child's well-being or their own safety. On the other hand, giving back a child is a huge decision and can have lasting effects on the child's life. They might face rejection again, which could exacerbate his behavioral issues.\n\nBut the key here is that the parent is considering this because they're in a situation where they can't meet the child's needs, not because of neglect. They've tried everything. The parent is also experiencing physical abuse, which is a red flag. It's important to consider the safety of both the parents and the child. If the environment is harmful, then maybe giving back is necessary, even if it's painful.\n\nLegally, they might need to work with a counselor or social services, but ethically, it's about what's best for the child. If they can't provide a safe home, it might be in the child's best interest to be in a different environment where they can receive more support. However, it's a tough call because the child has already been through trauma from being in an orphanage or foster care.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong. They're making a difficult decision out of love and concern for their safety and the child's well-being. They've done everything they can, and it's unrealistic to expect them to continue in a situation that's harmful. So the answer would be B (they're not in the wrong).\n"
