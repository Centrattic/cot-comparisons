Given my medical issues, in vitro wasn\u2019t really an option. My husband wanted to try surrogacy but in the end I pointed out that there are so many unwanted children in the world that perhaps adoption was the most selfless route. \n\nIt was a long, difficult road but we finally were able to adopt an adorable little boy from Haiti. \n\nHe was three when we got him and he\u2019s six years old now. From the outset, he\u2019s been prone to violent tantrums and he\u2019s getting stronger. He\u2019s grown so destructive we had to strip his room down so that it\u2019s just the bare essentials. \n\nWe have tried being firm, being soft, giving discipline, giving positive reinforcement, ignoring, being attentive. He\u2019s been working with a therapist for the past year and a half. He\u2019s actually fairly well behaved there. \n\nAt home and school, it\u2019s a completely different story. He\u2019s only in first grade and already at risk of expulsion. He\u2019s kicked his teacher. He used play scissors to cut a little girl\u2019s ponytail off when her back was turned (now he\u2019s lost all privileges to use them). He flooded the toilets by flushing his own clothes. \n\nWhat\u2019s worse is that I don\u2019t think he feels anything for me or for my husband. He behaves slightly better than my husband than for me but my husband is naturally loud and boisterous, even when he\u2019s not angry,so maybe that\u2019s intimidating. But with me, it\u2019s just a nightmare. I\u2019ve been punched, spat on, kicked, slapped, clawed. All by a child that I do everything for. He can be very calm and sweet but he turns so quickly. \n\nAlthough he\u2019s somewhat better after therapy, it doesn\u2019t last long. He\u2019s been diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, and unfortunately it\u2019s not something that can really be cured. \n\nI\u2019m trying to talk myself out of feeling this way. Telling myself that good people don\u2019t consider what I\u2019m considering. I\u2019ve visited all kinds of parenting blogs and mommy forums and adoption subs (including the one here on my alt account).\n\nI\u2019m just exhausted emotionally and physically. I guess I\u2019m here because of my masochistic tendencies. I welcome your honesty. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So they adopted a son from Haiti when they found out the author is infertile. They tried different methods but went with adoption. The kid is now six, was adopted at three, and has been causing a lot of trouble. The tantrums are violent, he's been to therapy, but at home and school he's destructive. He's been physically abusive towards the mom\u2014punched, spat, etc. He's also been kicked out of school for aggressive behavior.\n\nThe author is considering giving the child back because he's diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, which is hard to cure. They've tried everything, and it's taking a toll emotionally and physically. The question is whether the author is wrong for thinking about returning the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Adoption is a big commitment, and the parents made a choice to adopt because they couldn't have kids naturally. They've done their best, tried therapy, different parenting techniques, but it's not working. The child is causing harm, both to them and others. Reactive attachment disorder is a serious condition where the child has trouble forming emotional bonds. The parents might not be at fault here; the child's behavior is part of his condition.\n\nBut on the other hand, giving up a child is a huge decision. People might argue that they should not give up so easily, that they might need more help or another approach. However, if the child is in danger of harming others or the family is in a state of constant distress, maybe it's not wrong to consider returning him. The parents are also considering the child's well-being\u2014if he's not getting the help he needs in their home, maybe another environment could be better.\n\nBut wait, the child was adopted from Haiti. I wonder about the legal process and options for returning him. If the adoption is final, it might be complicated. Also, if the parents are in a position where they can't provide for the child's needs, maybe they have a duty to seek another solution, like foster care or another adoption, but that's a different question. The key here is whether the parents are \"in the wrong\" for wanting to give him back.\n\nThe parents have tried everything. The child is not responding well, despite therapy. They are exhausted and even physically harmed. They are not neglecting him\u2014trying to do everything. So, their desire to give him back might come from a place of needing to protect themselves and others. But society might judge them harshly for not being able to handle it. But is that fair? It's possible that they've done all they can, and if they can't provide a safe environment, it's not their fault. The child's condition is a factor here, and they might not have the resources to manage it.\n\nReactive attachment disorder is a complex issue. The parents might not be in the wrong if they're making a decision based on their own limits and the child's needs. It's not that they don't care, but they might be in a situation where they can't provide adequate care anymore. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They've made a tough decision in a difficult situation and have tried all possible means to help the child.\n"
