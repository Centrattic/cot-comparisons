She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he was a sperm donor twice for a woman he met online when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, which she was initially understanding about, but over time she started teasing and making jokes about it. Now, he didn't tell her about the second child because of her reaction. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the expectations are in a marriage when it comes to such information. Spouses generally have a right to know significant details about their partner's past, especially if it has ongoing implications. The fact that the author had two children with another woman through sperm donation is a big deal. Even though he didn't have a sexual relationship, the act of donating sperm twice involves creating two additional people who are genetically related to him. That could have implications in the future, especially if the children ever meet or if there are any legal or emotional issues that arise.\n\nThe author argues that he didn't want to tell his wife because she was making jokes and teasing him. But that seems like a reason to address her behavior rather than hide more information. If he had a good reason to believe that she would react negatively, but withholding the information could lead to bigger problems later, then maybe he's in the wrong. Also, even if she was being unkind, the author has a responsibility to be honest with his spouse, especially about something that affects their family dynamics.\n\nAnother angle is the fact that he used a false pretense to visit the woman again (under the guise of seeing an old friend). That seems deceitful from the start. He should have considered his wife's feelings before making the second donation. Additionally, the children's existence could impact future relationships, like if his daughter ever meets the donor siblings. Not disclosing this might prevent his wife from making informed decisions about how to handle such situations.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since the donations were non-sexual and he was honest about the first child, the second one is just an extension of the same situation. But the key difference is that the second child is a continuation of a relationship he had with another woman, even if it's not romantic. The author's decision to keep the second child a secret could be seen as a lack of transparency, which is a fundamental part of a marriage.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is usually valued in relationships. Withholding such significant information could be considered a breach of trust, even if the initial disclosure was done. The wife's reaction might need to be addressed through communication rather than avoiding the issue. The author might need to confront her teasing and work on resolving that with her, rather than hiding additional truths.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because he didn't disclose the second child, which is a significant part of his past that affects their family. Even if the wife's reaction is problematic, honesty is important in a marriage.\n"
