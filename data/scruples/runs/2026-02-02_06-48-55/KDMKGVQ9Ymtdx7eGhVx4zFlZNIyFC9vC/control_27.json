She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after they met. His wife was initially understanding but then started teasing him about it, especially after they had their own daughter. Now, the same woman who had the first child from his sperm asked him to donate again so the kids would be siblings. He did this secretly, not telling his wife. He's now considering whether to tell her, but is scared of her reactions and the teasing, which even includes jokes about their daughter marrying the donor child. The question is, is he in the wrong for keeping the second child a secret?\n\nHmm. Let's think about the key points here. The author had a prior relationship with the woman, and after his wife found out about the first child, she started making him uncomfortable with her teasing. He then decided not to inform her about the second donation. The main issue is whether withholding this information is wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, honesty is usually important. But there's the nuance that the wife was already making things difficult with the first child. The author might feel that revealing the second child would only make things worse. However, by not telling, he's keeping a significant secret. Even if the wife's reactions are problematic, isn't the author obligated to be truthful? Especially since there's a second child involved, which could have implications for the family dynamics, perhaps in the future when they meet or need to know.\n\nBut then again, the wife's behavior is part of the problem. She's using the first child as a way to tease and provoke, possibly in arguments. If the author fears that telling her would lead to more conflict or that she might use it against him, maybe there's some justification. However, keeping secrets can damage trust. The author's decision might be based on self-preservation, but is that a valid reason?\n\nAnother angle: The second child is also a result of his actions. Even if the wife was upset about the first, the author made a choice to have a second child without consulting her. That could be seen as acting without consideration for her feelings or their relationship. The fact that he lied by omission about the second child might be considered a betrayal, regardless of the wife's behavior.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the children. If the author's wife eventually finds out, even if it's through another means, it could be more hurtful. But if he tells her, maybe they can address it together, even if it's uncomfortable. The author's fear of her teasing might be a temporary issue compared to the long-term consequences of not being honest.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's teasing seems like an emotional issue she needs to address. The author shouldn't have to suffer from her jokes, but neither is he excused from being honest. Maybe the real problem is the wife's behavior, but the author's secrecy is still a separate issue.\n\nI think the key here is whether keeping the second child a secret breaks trust or is a lie by omission. In relationships, major secrets are generally frowned upon, even if the other person's reaction is negative. The author's decision to not disclose the second child, after already having the first one, might be seen as wrong because it was a deliberate choice to hide something significant. The fact that he had already told her about the first but not the second could also imply a double standard.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is withholding important information that affects their family. Even if the wife's reactions are problematic, the author's secrecy could harm the relationship. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being honest about the second child.\n"
