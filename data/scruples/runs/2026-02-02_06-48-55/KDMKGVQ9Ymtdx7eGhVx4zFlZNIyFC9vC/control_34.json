She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he donated sperm twice to a woman, first when he was 20 and they ended up with a son. He told his wife about the first donation, and she was initially understanding but later started teasing him. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the same woman asked him to donate again so the son would have a sibling, and he did that secretly. Now he's not telling his wife about the second child because she's already making fun of the first one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ethics here. The main issue is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. The wife was already made uncomfortable by the first donation. The author might feel that revealing the second one would escalate the tension. But relationships typically require honesty and transparency. By not telling her, the author is being deceptive, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction is problematic. She's using the first child to tease him, making jokes about incest, which is inappropriate. The author might feel justified in not wanting to add fuel to the fire. However, withholding information about another child is a significant omission. The second child is a direct result of his actions, and the wife might have a right to know, especially if there are potential implications for their daughter (like if the donor siblings ever met, as the wife joked about).\n\nAlso, the author didn't just keep the first child secret; he told her about the first one. The second child is a continuation of the same decision. By not disclosing the second time, he's being inconsistent. Even if the wife's reaction is harsh, the ethical responsibility is to be truthful. The author's decision not to tell her could be seen as deceitful because he's hiding a part of his past that affects his family.\n\nMoreover, the wife's jokes about incest and Joffrey from Game of Thrones are not just playful teasing; they touch on sensitive issues that could have real-life implications. The author's silence on the second child might prevent the wife from addressing her concerns or preventing potential conflicts in the future. It's possible that the wife's reaction stems from deeper insecurities or fears that she hasn't addressed, and hiding the second child doesn't resolve that; it just avoids the problem.\n\nIn terms of consent and responsibility, the author is the biological father of both children. If the wife were to find out the second child exists through another means, it could lead to more significant issues. The author's secrecy might breach the trust in their marriage, which is a key component of a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, while the wife's behavior is unkind and the author has valid reasons for discomfort, the act of not disclosing the second child is a violation of honesty in the relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child despite the challenging reaction he received about the first.\n"
