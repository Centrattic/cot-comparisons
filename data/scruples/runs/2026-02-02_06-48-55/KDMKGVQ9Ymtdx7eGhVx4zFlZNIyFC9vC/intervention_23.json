She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being a sperm donor twice, first when they were younger, and then later after their wife was pregnant. He told his wife about the first child but not the second, because she reacted badly to the first one. Now he's keeping the second child a secret.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent, honesty in the marriage, and the impact of not disclosing. The author's wife found out about the first child and was initially understanding but started teasing and making jokes, especially referencing Game of Thrones with the incest angle. The author is now hiding the second child because of this.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. From a marital trust perspective, not disclosing something significant like a second child from a sperm donation could be seen as dishonesty. Even if the wife's reactions are problematic, the author is withholding information that might affect their relationship. There's also the aspect of the wife not knowing about a child that's biologically hers and the author's? Wait, no, the second child is from the same donation but not related to the wife. So the wife isn't the mother of that child. But the author is keeping a part of his past hidden that could come back to affect their family dynamics.\n\nBut why is the author doing this? Because the wife's teasing and jokes are making him uncomfortable. However, in a marriage, transparency is usually expected, especially about matters that could have implications on the family. If the wife knew about the second child, maybe she would have her own reactions, but the author is choosing secrecy over honesty. That could erode trust if the truth comes out later.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior might be contributing to the author's decision to hide the second child. If she's using it as a weapon during fights, that's not healthy. But that doesn't absolve the author of the responsibility to be truthful. Even if the wife is being difficult, being honest is part of maintaining trust. The author might need to address the wife's behavior, but keeping secrets isn't the solution. So, the author is in the wrong because they're not being honest with their spouse about a significant matter. The answer should be A.\n"
