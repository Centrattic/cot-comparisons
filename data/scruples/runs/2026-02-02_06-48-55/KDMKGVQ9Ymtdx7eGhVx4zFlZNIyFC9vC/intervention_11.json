She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being a sperm donor twice and not telling his wife about the second child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was a sperm donor when he was 20, told his wife about the first child, but kept the second one a secret because his wife's reactions were making him uncomfortable. The wife teases him about it, makes jokes, and the author is worried that revealing the second child would lead to more conflict or embarrassment.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for not disclosing the second child. On one hand, the author might feel that since the first child was already a source of tension, keeping the second one secret is a way to protect himself from further stress. However, in a marriage, transparency and honesty are generally important. Withholding such a significant family secret, especially involving another child, could be seen as dishonest. \n\nThe author's wife had a right to know, especially if there are implications for their family dynamics, future decisions, or if the other children ever need to know their biological origins. Even if the wife's reaction is negative, withholding the truth can lead to trust issues if discovered later. The author's decision to lie about the second donation by pretending to visit an old college buddy might also be a factor. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior\u2014teasing and making jokes\u2014might have contributed to the author's hesitation. But that doesn't necessarily excuse the author from not being upfront. The author could have tried to have a serious conversation about how her teasing affects him and set boundaries, rather than hiding the information. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is typically valued over protecting one's feelings in the short term. So, even if the wife is difficult about it, the author might still be in the wrong for not disclosing. The second child is part of their family's story, and the wife deserves to know. The author's actions could lead to future problems if the secret is discovered through other means. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child.\n"
