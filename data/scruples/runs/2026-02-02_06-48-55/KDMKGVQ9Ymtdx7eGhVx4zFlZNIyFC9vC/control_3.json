She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation, given that she was already difficult about the first one.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, leading to a son. He told his wife about this after they started dating, and she was initially understanding but later became teasing and sarcastic, especially referencing the first child and making jokes about possible inbreeding with their own daughter. Then, the woman asked him to donate again, resulting in a second child. He kept this secret because of his wife's reactions, fearing it would escalate.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The key points here are honesty in a marriage and the wife's right to know about potential half-siblings for their daughter. The author might be protecting himself from further conflict, but withholding such significant information could be seen as deceitful, especially if the wife's knowledge might impact their family dynamics. \n\nHowever, the wife's reactions are problematic too. Her teasing and using it in fights could be creating a hostile environment. The author's decision to withhold might be a way to avoid unnecessary stress. But if the second child is part of their family in any way (like the daughter meeting them), then not informing the wife could lead to bigger issues. \n\nAlso, the author's actions involve prior consent from the woman, and he didn't have a relationship beyond the donation. So there's no infidelity, but there's still the matter of transparency. In a marriage, major life decisions affecting family should ideally be shared, but the author's fear of the wife's reaction is valid.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions aren't malicious, but the secrecy could be harmful in the long run. The wife's behavior is immature, but that doesn't justify complete secrecy. The author should probably consider the potential consequences of both telling and not telling. If the second child has no connection to their daughter, maybe it's less urgent. But if there's a chance the daughter might interact with the half-brothers, then honesty becomes more critical.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's keeping secrets that could affect their family. On the other, the wife's reactions are unkind. However, in a marriage, full disclosure about such matters is generally expected. The author's choice to omit the second child might be to prevent conflict, but it's still withholding information that could be significant. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being fully honest, even if the wife's behavior is problematic.\n"
