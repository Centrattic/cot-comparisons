She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being a sperm donor twice, first telling his wife about the first child but not the second one. The wife has been teasing him about the first child, which is why he hasn't mentioned the second.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author donated sperm when he was 20, and the wife found out later. She was initially understanding but over time started teasing and making jokes, including referencing \"Game of Thrones\" incest jokes. Then, the author donated sperm again without telling his wife, leading to a second child. He's now considering whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second donation.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether withholding the second donation is dishonest or unethical. The wife was upset about the first one, so the author decided not to mention the second. But does that make him in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nHonesty in a relationship is usually important. Even if the wife's reactions are hurtful, the author might still have a duty to be truthful. However, the wife's teasing and jokes might make it a difficult situation. The author might fear further conflict or emotional distress if he discloses the second child.\n\nBut the problem is that the author is keeping a significant secret. If the wife found out about the second child, she might feel betrayed, especially since she was already upset about the first. On the other hand, the author's reasons for not telling her are based on her past reactions. There's a balance between honesty and protecting oneself from potential harm.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the children. If the wife is involved in raising their own daughter, knowing about the other children might have implications, especially if the donor children ever come into their lives. The author might also have responsibilities towards those children, like financial support, which the wife might be unaware of.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author had a valid reason to believe that disclosure would cause significant harm or if the wife's reactions were abusive, maybe it's understandable. However, withholding such information without a valid reason could be seen as deceitful. The author's decision might not be malicious but rather a way to avoid conflict, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the lack of transparency.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. Even if the topic is uncomfortable, the author might need to have an honest conversation. The fact that the wife makes jokes and teases could be a sign of deeper issues, but the author still has a responsibility to be truthful. So, while the author's intentions might be to avoid conflict, withholding such personal information could be considered dishonest, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife's reactions are genuinely hurtful and manipulative (using the topic during fights), the author might be protecting himself. But the line between self-protection and dishonesty is thin here. The author's actions could be seen as a way to maintain peace but at the cost of transparency.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of malicious intent, but the act of withholding such a significant detail about his past and current actions could be considered dishonest, especially if it affects their relationship dynamics and future. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being fully honest, even if the wife's reactions are problematic.\n"
