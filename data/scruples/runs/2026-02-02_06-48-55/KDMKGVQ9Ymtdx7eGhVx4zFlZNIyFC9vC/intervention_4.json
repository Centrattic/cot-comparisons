She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a man who donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, but when she started teasing him and making jokes about it, he decided not to tell her about the second child. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong for keeping this secret.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The wife was initially understanding but later became critical, using the situation to tease him and bring up uncomfortable topics, especially during arguments. The author is now hiding the second child to avoid further conflict. The question is whether not disclosing the second child is wrong.\n\nMarital trust and honesty are usually important factors in relationships. The author didn't tell his wife about the second donation, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the wife's behavior might have contributed to the author's decision. If she was making fun of him and using it as a weapon during fights, he might feel justified in keeping it a secret to protect himself from emotional harm.\n\nBut on the other hand, withholding such significant information can lead to bigger issues if the truth comes out later. The author's wife might feel betrayed when she finds out about the second child, even if she was previously unkind about the first. The author might be avoiding conflict in the short term but causing more damage in the long run.\n\nAnother angle is the author's responsibility to his own children. The second child's existence is part of his life and could impact his family. Not telling his wife might prevent immediate tension, but it could create complications in the future, such as questions from the daughter about her biological family or potential half-siblings.\n\nThe author's actions when donating the second time\u2014visiting under the guise of seeing an old friend\u2014show that he was being deceptive. This deception might be a red flag. Even if the wife was difficult about the first disclosure, the author's choice to hide the second instance adds another layer of dishonesty.\n\nHowever, the wife's behavior is also problematic. If she's using the first child as a jab and making offensive jokes, the author might feel that his trust and boundaries were violated, making his secrecy a form of self-protection. But this doesn't necessarily absolve him of the responsibility to be honest with his spouse.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is crucial. The author's decision to withhold information might stem from fear of conflict, but it's a risk that could backfire. The wife has the right to know about all children resulting from his sperm donations, as it affects their family dynamics and their daughter's potential future.\n\nIn summary, while the wife's behavior is undoubtedly part of the problem, the author's choice to hide the second child is a breach of trust. The right thing would have been to communicate openly, perhaps setting boundaries with the wife about how the topic is discussed. Instead, he chose secrecy, which is likely where he's in the wrong.\n"
