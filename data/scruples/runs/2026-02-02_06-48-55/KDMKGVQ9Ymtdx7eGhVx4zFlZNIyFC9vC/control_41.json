She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he was a sperm donor when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, but she kept teasing him about it. Now, there's a second child from the same donor, and he hasn't told his wife about it. The question is whether he's wrong for keeping that secret.\n\nFirst, I need to think about his actions. He donated sperm before he was married, and he did tell his wife about the first child. The problem is that his wife's reaction was negative and she keeps bringing it up in a teasing or hurtful way. Now, he didn't tell her about the second child. Why? Because he's worried she'll react the same way, making things uncomfortable. \n\nBut is keeping that secret wrong? Well, marriage usually involves trust and honesty. If he's not sharing important information, especially about another child, that could be an issue. Even if the wife's reaction is not ideal, the author has a responsibility to be truthful. The second child is part of his life, and his wife has a right to know, especially since there might be implications like if they ever meet the children or if there are health-related issues. \n\nAlso, he mentioned that the wife is using the first child as a way to tease or fight with him. That's not healthy, but it doesn't justify him lying about the second child. The problem isn't just about his discomfort; it's about the spouse's right to know. Even if the wife's behavior is problematic, the author has a duty to communicate fully. \n\nAnother angle is that he's keeping a secret that could affect their family dynamics. If the wife finds out through someone else, that could cause more damage. Plus, if there's a chance the daughter from the sperm donation could meet their own daughter, as he mentioned with the Game of Thrones joke, that has real implications. The author is omitting information that could lead to complications. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is clearly part of the issue here. She's using the first child to tease and provoke, which is unfair. But the author's response is to withhold another secret. He might be trying to protect himself from further teasing, but that doesn't justify the lack of honesty. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author is not in the wrong entirely because the wife's reaction is part of the problem. However, he is withholding a significant secret that affects their relationship. Since marriage requires transparency, even if the other person reacts poorly, he's obligated to tell the truth. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second child. \n\nAnswer: A\n"
