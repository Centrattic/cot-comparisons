She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, leading to a child. He told his wife about this when they started dating, but she's been teasing and making jokes about it ever since. Now, he secretly donated sperm to the same woman a second time, resulting in another child, and he hasn't told his wife. He's considering whether he should come clean but is worried about her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects of not disclosing the second child. The wife has a right to know about potential half-siblings for their own daughter, right? If their daughter ever meets these kids, it could have implications for family dynamics. Also, the wife might have feelings about the fact that her husband was a sperm donor twice, especially if she's already uncomfortable with the first instance.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction seems to be more teasing and using it as a source of jokes, which might be hurtful. The author might feel that bringing up the second child would just add to the tension. But withholding such information could be seen as dishonesty. The author is keeping a secret that could affect their family's future, which might be a breach of trust. Even if the wife's teasing is annoying, the author's decision to hide the second donation might not be justified because it's a significant omission.\n\nAlso, considering that the second donation happened during the wife's pregnancy, it's possible that the author decided to do it without considering her feelings, which might be another ethical issue. The wife might have different opinions about having half-siblings for their child, especially if she's already had a hard time with the first one. So, the author's failure to communicate this second act of sperm donation, despite the first one being a point of contention, could be seen as wrong because it's withholding important information that affects their family.\n\nMoreover, the author's reasoning is that he's avoiding conflict, but keeping this secret could lead to bigger issues in the future. If the wife ever finds out through another source, it might damage their relationship more than if he had been honest from the start. So, ethically, it might be better to come clean even if the conversation is difficult.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is in the wrong because he kept a significant secret that affects his family and wife's trust. The fact that the wife's reaction is negative doesn't justify not disclosing the second child. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
