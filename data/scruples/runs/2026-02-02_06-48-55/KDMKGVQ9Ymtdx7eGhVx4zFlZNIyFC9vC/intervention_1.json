She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, and she initially understood. But over time, she started teasing him and bringing it up in a negative way, especially referencing \"Game of Thrones\" jokes about their daughter marrying the donor son. Now he's hiding the fact that there's a second child from the same donation.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for withholding the information about the second child. Let's consider the key factors.\n\n1. **Marital Honesty and Trust**: In a marriage, honesty is generally considered crucial. The author didn't disclose a significant life event (fathering a second child) that could affect their family dynamics. Even if the wife was making jokes, the author might have a responsibility to share this information because it's a fundamental part of their relationship.\n\n2. **Wife's Reaction**: The wife's behavior was inappropriate\u2014teasing and using the situation in fights. However, her reaction doesn't absolve the author of the obligation to be truthful. Even if the wife is acting out, the author's decision to hide the second child could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\n3. **Impact on the Family**: The existence of two donor children could have implications for the author's own child and the donor children. If the donor sons ever found out they were related to the author's daughter, there could be ethical or emotional issues. The author's decision to withhold this information might prevent potential conflicts but could also lead to more complications if discovered later.\n\n4. **Intentions and Motives**: The author's reasoning is that the wife's reactions are uncomfortable. However, avoiding conflict by lying might create a bigger problem. The author might have acted out of fear of further conflict, but this doesn't justify the secrecy.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Sperm donation typically involves agreements about privacy and disclosure. If the author agreed to be a donor, he might have legal or ethical obligations to inform the children about their biological father. However, the question here is about his relationship with his wife, not the donor children.\n\n6. **Communication Issues**: The author's wife's teasing is a communication problem. Instead of hiding the second child, addressing the underlying issues in their communication might be a better approach. The author could have tried to confront her about her behavior rather than withholding information.\n\nPutting this all together, the author's decision to not disclose the second child is a violation of trust and honesty in the marriage, regardless of the wife's behavior. While the wife's reaction is problematic, the author has a responsibility to be truthful. The secrecy could lead to more significant issues if the truth comes out later, potentially damaging the marriage further.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the wife's behavior justified the author's secrecy. But in most cases, honesty is the foundation of a relationship, and withholding such information is generally seen as a mistake. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
