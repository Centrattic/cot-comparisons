She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, had a son, told his wife about it after they met. The wife was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes about it, especially after they had their own daughter. Then, the author secretly donated sperm a second time to the same woman, resulting in another son. He hasn't told his wife about the second child because of her reactions.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the author did tell his wife about the first child. The problem arose when the wife started making jokes and teasing him. However, the author kept the second child a secret. That seems like a major omission. \n\nMarriage typically requires honesty and transparency, especially about having biological children. The wife has a right to know if her husband has another child, especially a second one. The author's actions could affect the family dynamics, future relationships, and even legal aspects. For example, if the wife found out later, it might cause significant trust issues. Also, the children might not know about their half-brother, which could be impactful for them as well.\n\nThe author's justification is that he didn't want to deal with the wife's teasing and the discomfort it caused. But withholding such important information is a breach of trust. Even if the wife is making light of the situation, the author's responsibility is to be honest. \n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement with the sperm donor. The author agreed to help, which is fine, but not informing his spouse about the second child is where the issue lies. The wife's reaction, while unkind, doesn't absolve the author of the responsibility to tell the truth. \n\nIn relationships, big secrets can cause more harm in the long run. Even if the wife is making jokes, the author should have addressed the underlying issues rather than hiding the second child. The author's decision to keep it secret could be seen as a lack of integrity in the marriage. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he didn't disclose the second child, which is a significant omission in a marriage.\n"
