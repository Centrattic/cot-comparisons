She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, when he was 20, donated sperm to a woman he met online. She had a son, and he told his wife about this when they first met a year later. His wife was initially understanding but later started teasing him about it. As they had their own daughter, the wife's comments became more annoying, like asking if it was done naturally or in a cup. The author says he never touched the woman, just shook her hand. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the woman asked him to donate again so her son would have a sibling. He did this under the guise of visiting an old friend, resulting in a second son. He hasn't told his wife about the second child because she's been so critical of the first one, using it as a joke, especially referencing Game of Thrones. Now he's unsure whether to tell her, fearing it would make things worse.\n\nSo the main question is whether he's in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child. Let's break it down. The first time, he did tell her. The second time, he didn't. The wife's reaction to the first was negative, so he's withholding the second to avoid conflict. But is that ethical?\n\nIn relationships, transparency is usually important. If there's a significant decision that affects the spouse, especially regarding children, not disclosing could be a problem. The author might be justified in not wanting to face his wife's teasing, but keeping a secret about another child might be seen as dishonest. However, the first time he was honest, but the wife's reaction was unsupportive. So maybe he's trying to protect himself from her behavior.\n\nBut on the other hand, having a second child from the same situation without discussing it with his spouse could be considered a major omission. Even if the wife is difficult about it, the author has a responsibility to be truthful. The second child is another person's life, and the author's spouse might have a right to know, especially if there are future implications like health history or legal matters.\n\nAlso, the author is using the guise of visiting an old friend, which might be misleading. The fact that he's involved in two children from this arrangement without full disclosure to his spouse is a key point. Even if the wife is teasing, the author's decision to keep the second child a secret could be seen as deceitful. So maybe he's in the wrong because he's hiding a significant fact from his spouse, regardless of her reaction.\n\nBut then again, if the wife is using it to tease and fight, maybe he's protecting himself from her behavior. However, that doesn't justify the secrecy. There's a balance between protecting oneself from negativity and being honest with a spouse. In a marriage, certain information is necessary, especially about other children. So the author's decision to withhold the second child's existence might be unethical, even if the wife's reaction is problematic.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the information is material to the marriage. Since the second child is another person, and there could be legal, emotional, or medical implications, not telling his wife is in the wrong. The author is withholding important information that could affect their relationship and future, even if it's uncomfortable. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
