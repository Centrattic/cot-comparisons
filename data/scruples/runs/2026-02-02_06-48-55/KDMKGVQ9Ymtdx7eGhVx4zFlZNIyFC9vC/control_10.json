She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author had a sperm donation situation when he was 20. He donated to a single mother who wanted to have another child, so their first child would have a sibling. He told his wife about the first child, and initially she was okay, but over time she started teasing him about it. Now, there's a second child from the same donation, and he hasn't told his wife about it. He's considering whether he should tell her but is worried about her reaction based on how she's handled the first one.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by not disclosing the second child. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author had already donated to the woman once, and his wife knew about the first child. However, she's been making jokes and teasing him, which he finds uncomfortable. Now, he donated again, leading to a second child, and he hasn't told his wife. \n\nIs there a duty to disclose this? Well, in a marriage, there's generally an expectation of honesty and transparency. The author didn't tell his wife about the second donation, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even though the wife's reaction to the first child was problematic, the author's decision to not share the second instance might still be wrong because he's keeping a significant secret that affects their relationship.\n\nBut then again, maybe the wife's behavior was so hurtful that the author felt justified in withholding the information. The key here is whether the author's actions were intentional deceit or if he was just trying to avoid conflict. The author says he agreed to the second donation under the guise of seeing an old friend, which implies he was being secretive. That secrecy could be considered dishonest, especially since the wife already knew about the first donation and had issues with it.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the family. If the wife found out later, perhaps through other means, it could cause more significant issues. The author might be avoiding a difficult conversation, but withholding such information can lead to greater trust issues down the line. Even if the wife's teasing is annoying, the author's responsibility to be honest might take precedence.\n\nHowever, the wife's behavior shouldn't be ignored. If she was using the first donation in fights or making inappropriate jokes, maybe the author felt it was a way to protect himself. But does that excuse not being truthful about the second child? It's a tricky balance between personal boundaries and marital honesty.\n\nIn many relationships, transparency is crucial. If the author had a second child through sperm donation, especially to the same woman, it's a significant detail that could affect their family dynamics. The fact that he went through with the second donation without discussing it with his wife suggests a lack of communication and mutual decision-making, which are important in a marriage.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't disclose the second donation, regardless of his wife's previous reaction. While her teasing is problematic, the decision to have another child via sperm donation is a major life choice that should be discussed with a spouse. The secrecy here likely breaches the trust in their marriage, even if the wife's behavior was difficult.\n"
