She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author had a sperm donation experience in his 20s, told his wife about the first child, but kept the second one a secret. His wife has been teasing him about it, and now he's wondering if he should have told her about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, which his wife initially found okay but later started teasing and bringing it up inappropriately. Then, he agreed to a second donation without his wife's knowledge. The main issue is the second child. Did he have an obligation to inform his wife about the second donation?\n\nMarriage usually involves openness and honesty. Even though the first donation was disclosed, the second one wasn't. The author might have a right to privacy, but also, his wife has a right to know about potential family matters. The wife's teasing and jokes are problematic, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author withholding a major secret. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he didn't want to deal with the same teasing again. However, keeping a secret about another child from his wife could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the wife's behavior is annoying, the author isn't absolved of responsibility for not being truthful. \n\nAlso, the second donation happened after they had a child of their own. There might be implications if the wife wanted to know about any half-siblings for their daughter or if there were any legal or emotional ramifications. However, the author claims it's strictly professional and he had no contact beyond that. \n\nAnother angle: the author's decision to not disclose the second donation might be to protect his feelings, but in a marriage, transparency is important. The author's actions could be seen as deceitful, even if the wife's reactions are problematic. \n\nSo, the author is keeping a significant secret that could affect their family dynamics. Even if the wife's teasing is an issue, the author's choice to hide the second donation might be considered wrong because it's another layer of secrecy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not disclosing the second child.\n"
