She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he donated sperm twice when he was younger, first when he was 20 and then again later. He told his wife about the first child but not the second. His wife has been making jokes and teasing him about the first one, so he decided not to tell her about the second. \n\nFirst, I need to consider what's expected in a relationship regarding honesty and transparency. Generally, people are expected to be truthful with their partners, especially about things that could affect their lives or cause issues later. The author's decision to withhold information about the second child could lead to problems if the wife finds out in another way, which might cause more conflict.\n\nThe wife's reaction to the first child was problematic\u2014teasing and making jokes, including some that reference a show they both watch. The author might feel hurt or embarrassed, which is understandable. However, by not disclosing the second donation, he's keeping a secret that could have significant implications. If their daughter were to meet the donor children, it could create a complicated family dynamic. The wife's teasing might be inappropriate, but the author's response is to withhold information, which isn't addressing the root issue.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent and communication. Even if the wife's reaction is difficult, the author could try to communicate his feelings about her teasing and set boundaries. By not telling her, he's avoiding a necessary conversation that might resolve the tension. Secrets in relationships can lead to mistrust if they're discovered later. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the wife's reactions are not constructive, and he's trying to protect himself from further discomfort. But the second child is a new factor that could have legal and emotional ramifications. If the wife finds out later, she might feel betrayed, especially if the children are now part of their lives in some way.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is withholding information that affects their family structure. Even though the wife's teasing is an issue, the right approach might have been to address the communication problems rather than hide the second child. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not being honest about the second donation.\n"
