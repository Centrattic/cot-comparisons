She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, resulting in a son. He told his wife after they had been together a year, and she was initially understanding. But over time, especially as they had their own daughter, she started teasing him about it, making jokes about how it happened, and even referencing Game of Thrones to make fun of potential incest. Then, the woman asked him to donate again so the son would have a sibling, and he did this secretly, not telling his wife. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling her about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was honest about the first donation, but then kept the second one a secret because of his wife's reactions. The issue here is about communication and trust in the marriage. Even though the wife was teasing, the author could argue that her behavior made him uncomfortable, so he decided to withhold the information. However, not disclosing the second donation might be seen as a breach of trust, especially since the wife already knows about the first one. The author might have a point if the wife's teasing was malicious, but keeping a secret about a second child could also be problematic. \n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the family. If the wife found out later, it might cause more conflict, but if she's already making jokes, maybe she's not taking it seriously. However, the author's decision not to disclose could lead to feelings of betrayal if she ever finds out. Also, the second child is a sibling to the first, so the author might have ongoing responsibilities or emotional ties that his wife isn't aware of, which could affect their family dynamics. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior in teasing and using it in fights might justify the author's hesitation. But that doesn't necessarily mean it's right to keep the secret. In a relationship, honesty is usually expected, even if the other person is reacting poorly. The author might need to find a way to address the wife's teasing rather than keeping the secret about the second child. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's decision to not tell his wife about the second child might be seen as a way to avoid conflict, but it's a secret that could have serious consequences if discovered later. The key here is whether withholding information is the right choice when it comes to something significant like having another child. In many cases, transparency is valued in relationships, even if the other person isn't handling it well. The author might be in the wrong for not being honest about the second donation, despite his wife's reactions.\n"
