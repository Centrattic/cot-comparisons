She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child he was a sperm donor for, after his wife was already upset about the first one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child. Then, the woman asked him to donate again, and he did this secretly. Now, his wife teases him about the first child, makes jokes, and he's considering whether to tell her about the second child.\n\nThe key points here are transparency in relationships and the potential harm of not disclosing. The author's wife already found out about the first donation and is reacting negatively. By not telling her about the second child, he's keeping a secret that could affect their relationship. Even if his wife's reactions are hurtful, withholding information can lead to trust issues. \n\nMarital relationships require honesty. The author might be trying to avoid conflict, but not disclosing the second child is a form of deception. If the wife found out about the second child later, it could cause bigger problems. Also, the fact that he used a sperm donor twice might have implications if the biological children ever meet the author's own child, leading to complicated family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is not ideal either. Teasing and using it in fights is unkind, but that doesn't excuse the author's secrecy. The right approach would have been to address her concerns about the first donation and then have an open conversation about the second one. Hiding it could erode trust even more if discovered later.\n\nSo, even though the wife's reactions are problematic, the author's decision to not disclose the second child is a breach of trust. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being fully transparent.\n"
