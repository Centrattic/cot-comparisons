She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child he donated sperm to, after she gave him a hard time about the first one.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20, which led to a son. He told his wife after a year, and initially she was understanding. But as time went on, especially after their own daughter was born, she started teasing him about it. The jokes and questions about how he donated (like \"naturally\" or in a cup) are making him uncomfortable. Then, the donor mom asked him to donate again so the kids would have siblings, and he did, under the guise of visiting a college buddy. Now he's keeping this second child a secret because he's afraid of her reaction.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not disclosing the second donation. Let me consider the ethical angles here. Marital transparency is usually important. If a spouse has a child from a previous relationship or a donation, it's generally expected to share that information. But in this case, the author is the one who donated sperm, not having a biological child with someone else. However, by not telling his wife about the second donation, he's hiding part of his past, even if the first was already known.\n\nBut wait, the first donation was revealed, and she reacted poorly. The author now is hiding the second one. Is that fair? His wife's reaction might be out of jealousy or insecurity, but the author's responsibility is to be honest in the marriage. Hiding the second child could lead to more issues down the line, like if the second child ever needs to know his biological father or if the wife finds out through other means. Also, the author might have a relationship with the first child but not the second, but that's not the point here. The key is honesty between spouses.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is clearly problematic. Making jokes about the first child and bringing it up during fights suggests she's using the information to hurt him. The author might feel justified in not wanting to provoke further tension. But withholding information can erode trust. Even if her reaction is harsh, the author is still obligated to be truthful. The second child is another layer of the same situation, and keeping it a secret might be seen as deceitful.\n\nAlso, the method of donation matters. If he used a formal process, maybe it's less of an issue, but since he donated again under a guise, it could be seen as intentionally misleading. That complicates things because it's not just about not disclosing but also about being deceptive in the process.\n\nSo, while the wife's behavior is definitely unkind and possibly inconsiderate, the author's choice to not disclose the second donation might be a way to avoid conflict. However, from an ethical standpoint, full transparency is usually expected in a marriage. Hiding this information could be seen as wrong because it's a significant part of his past that affects their relationship. Therefore, the answer might be A, yes he's in the wrong, because even if her teasing is problematic, he has a duty to be honest. But I'm a bit conflicted since her reaction is part of the problem. However, in most cases, the obligation to disclose is still on the person with the information, especially regarding offspring. So I think A is the answer.\n"
