She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the man donated sperm twice to a single mother when he was younger, told his wife about the first child, but not the second. His wife has been teasing him about it, and he's considering keeping the second child a secret.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author didn't tell his wife about the second donation. The wife was already upset about the first one, so he decided not to mention the second. The question is whether that makes him in the wrong.\n\nMarital transparency is important. In most relationships, honesty is expected, especially about issues that could affect the marriage. The wife already knows about the first child, but the second one is a new piece of information. The author is keeping it secret because his wife has a history of teasing and using it as a weapon in arguments. However, keeping a secret like this, especially regarding another child, could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nBut there are mitigating factors. The wife's reaction might be part of the problem. If she's using the first child as a way to manipulate or tease, the author might feel justified in not sharing more. However, even if the wife's behavior is problematic, the author has a responsibility to be honest. Not disclosing new information about a second child could lead to future issues, especially if the wife finds out later in a different way, which might cause more conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for not telling is based on protecting himself from discomfort and his wife's teasing. But in a marriage, transparency is usually expected. The fact that he had a second child through sperm donation when his wife already knew about the first one is significant. The author might be avoiding conflict, but withholding such information could be considered dishonest.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior might be contributing to the problem. She's making jokes about Game of Thrones and using the first child as a source of teasing. The author might feel that his wife isn't respecting his past actions. However, that's not an excuse to hide information about a second child. The author has a duty to be honest, even if the wife's reaction is negative. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is keeping information about another person's child, which could have implications for his marriage. Even if the wife is acting immaturely, the author's decision to not disclose the second child might be hiding something important. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not being fully honest with his wife, which is a foundational element in a marriage.\n"
