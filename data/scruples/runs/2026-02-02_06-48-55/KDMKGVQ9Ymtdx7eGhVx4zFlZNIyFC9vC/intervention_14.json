She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being a sperm donor twice to the same woman, and he told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife has been teasing and making jokes about the first child, which makes him uncomfortable. He's deciding whether to tell her about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main issue here is withholding information. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child after she had a negative reaction to the first. Is it wrong to keep that secret? Well, marriage typically requires transparency and honesty. Even if the wife's reaction is unpleasant, the author might have an obligation to share important information like having another child. Not disclosing could lead to trust issues later.\n\nAlso, the author's actions might have consequences. If the wife finds out later, she might feel betrayed. The author is choosing not to be honest to avoid conflict or teasing, but this could backfire. Relationships require mutual trust, and keeping secrets, even for good reasons, can be harmful.\n\nAnother angle is the children involved. The second child exists and is related to the author. The wife might want to know for various reasons, including potential legal, emotional, or logistical aspects. Not informing her could affect their family dynamics. The author is making a decision that affects the family without their knowledge, which might be considered selfish.\n\nHowever, the wife's behavior is also a factor. She's been teasing and making jokes, which is unkind and could justify the author's hesitation. But that doesn't mean lying or withholding is the right choice. The author should address the wife's teasing in a healthy way rather than hiding more information.\n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is generally valued in relationships. Even if the truth is difficult, it's important to be truthful. The author's decision to withhold the second child might be to protect himself from further teasing, but it's not a valid reason to be dishonest. He should consider having a serious conversation with his wife to address her teasing and explain the situation, rather than keeping it a secret.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for not being truthful about the second child. The decision to withhold information, despite the wife's reaction, undermines trust and transparency in the marriage. The correct approach would be to communicate openly, even if it's uncomfortable.\n"
