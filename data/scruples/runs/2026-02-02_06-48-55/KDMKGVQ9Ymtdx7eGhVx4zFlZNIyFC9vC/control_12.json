She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child he donated sperm to. The situation is that he was a sperm donor when he was 20, and he told his wife after a year. She was initially understanding but started teasing him and making jokes, especially about the possibility of their daughter marrying the donor son, which is brought up from Game of Thrones. Then, after his wife was pregnant, the same woman asked him to donate again, which he did under the pretense of visiting an old friend. Now he's keeping the second child a secret because of her reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. When you're in a committed relationship, especially marriage, transparency is usually expected. The author didn't inform his wife about the first child until after they met, a year later. Then, after that, when the woman needed another donation, he went ahead without telling his wife. The fact that he used a guise to visit her suggests he was trying to keep it hidden from the start, which could be a red flag.\n\nThe wife's reactions are a mix of teasing and making uncomfortable jokes. The author finds this uncomfortable and wants to avoid the issue. But by not disclosing the second child, he's hiding information that might be significant for their relationship. Even if the wife is making light of it now, the author's decision to not be honest about the second donation could be seen as deceitful. \n\nAlso, the children's well-being is a factor. The second child exists and could potentially be part of their family's story. If the wife found out later, it might cause more issues. The author might be considering his wife's emotional state, but withholding such information is generally not considered acceptable in a marriage. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and keeping secrets about biological children, even if not raised by him, could undermine that trust.\n\nAnother angle: the original agreement with the nurse. He agreed to help her have a child, and she had a son. Now, when she asked for another donation, he did so. Was there any discussion about future donations? If he agreed without involving his wife, that's a problem because in a marriage, decisions that affect the family should be mutual. The wife might have different feelings now that they have a child together, and not including her in that decision could be a betrayal.\n\nThe \"how would he bring it up\" part shows he's aware of the potential for conflict, but the core issue is the lack of honesty. Even if the wife is using it to tease or joke, the author's responsibility is to be truthful. Hiding the second child is a lie of omission, which is still a lie. So ethically, he's in the wrong for not being upfront about the second donation. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, because the author is withholding significant information from his wife that affects their family dynamic, and this is considered dishonest in a marriage, regardless of how the wife has reacted to the first child.\n"
