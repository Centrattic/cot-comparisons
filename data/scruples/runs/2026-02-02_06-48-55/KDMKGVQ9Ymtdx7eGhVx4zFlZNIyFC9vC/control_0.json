She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman he met online when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after they met, and she was initially understanding. But over time, she began teasing him and making jokes about it, especially related to the first child and even making references to Game of Thrones. Now, he donated again without telling her, and he's considering whether to come clean.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. Let's look at the key points.\n\n1. **Transparency in Marriage**: Marriage is built on trust and communication. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the first time was told, the second time was done without her knowledge. That's a big thing because he's adding another layer of secrecy.\n\n2. **Wife's Reactions**: The wife's reactions to the first child were problematic\u2014teasing, jokes about how it happened, and using it as a weapon in arguments. The author might feel that her behavior is unkind and maybe even disrespectful. However, his response was to withhold the second time, which could be seen as hiding something important.\n\n3. **Impact on Family**: The existence of two children from sperm donations is a significant part of the author's life. If the wife were to find out later, especially if it's discovered through other means (like the children meeting), it could cause more damage. The author might think that keeping it secret protects the current family dynamic, but it also creates a lack of honesty.\n\n4. **Intentions and Context**: The author claims the donations were strictly professional and he didn't have a relationship with the woman. He wanted to help her. However, the second donation happened under the guise of visiting an old friend, which might raise questions about his honesty to his wife.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Even if the wife was unkind, the author has a responsibility to disclose major life events that affect their family and future. Not disclosing could lead to future issues, like the children from the donations being part of their lives in some way, or if the wife needs to know for medical reasons.\n\n6. **Communication Strategy**: The author is struggling with how to approach the conversation. Maybe the issue isn't just about the secret but how to address the existing tension around the first child. If he can't communicate openly, that's a problem in itself.\n\nPutting it all together: While the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's decision to withhold information about the second child is a breach of trust. In a marriage, transparency is crucial even when one partner is being difficult. The author is in a tough spot, but keeping the second child a secret could lead to bigger issues down the line. Therefore, I think the author is in the wrong for not disclosing the second child.\n"
