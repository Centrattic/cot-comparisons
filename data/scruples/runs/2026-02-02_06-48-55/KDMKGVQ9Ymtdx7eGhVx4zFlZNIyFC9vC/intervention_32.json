She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from a sperm donation. The situation involves some complex factors.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and he told his wife about the first child. However, his wife's reaction became uncomfortable over time, with teasing and jokes, which he found upsetting. Then, the same woman asked for another donation, leading to a second child. The author didn't disclose this second child because of his wife's previous reaction.\n\nSo, the main issue here is honesty in the marriage. The author's decision to withhold the second child's existence could be seen as a breach of trust. Even though the wife's behavior was unkind, the author has a responsibility to be truthful in the relationship. Marriages require transparency, especially about such significant matters. The fact that the wife's teasing is uncomfortable doesn't justify the author's secrecy. By not telling her about the second child, he's hiding part of his past that could affect their family dynamics, especially in the future if the children from the donations become part of their lives.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning for not disclosing the second child seems to be based on fear of the wife's reaction rather than any valid concern for her well-being or the children's. The wife's jokes are not a justification for deceit. The author might be avoiding conflict, but that doesn't excuse the lack of honesty. Relationships require open communication, even when the topics are uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, one might argue that the wife's reaction was inappropriate and that the author's intent was to help someone, which was a kind act. However, the decision to withhold such significant information is still problematic. The author might feel hurt by his wife's teasing, but hiding the truth can lead to worse consequences if discovered later. Trust is a cornerstone of marriage, and keeping such a secret, even if well-intentioned, undermines that trust.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's decision to not disclose the second child is a breach of marital honesty. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
