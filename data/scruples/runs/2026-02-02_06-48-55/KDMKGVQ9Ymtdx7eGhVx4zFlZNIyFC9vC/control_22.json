She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, but when his wife gave him a hard time, he didn't mention the second child. The wife teases him about it, makes jokes, and it's causing him discomfort. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong for keeping the secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the moral or ethical obligations are here. Typically, in a marriage, honesty and transparency are important. The author didn't hide the first child initially, but after the wife's negative reaction, he withheld the second. But why did he do that? Because her reaction was making him uncomfortable. But does that justify not being honest?\n\nThe wife is being critical and using it against him, which is unfair. However, the author has another child from a sperm donation, which might have implications. If he had known that the woman wanted another child using his sperm, he should have considered how to handle that before agreeing, especially if he was in a committed relationship at the time. Wait, when he donated the second time, he was already married and his wife was pregnant. So, he kept that secret while his wife was carrying their own child. That seems like a significant omission.\n\nEven if the wife's teasing is unkind, the author is withholding information about another child he's biologically related to. That could affect the family dynamics, especially if there are any future interactions or if the wife ever finds out. It's not just about his feelings but also about her right to know about any children that exist from his sperm donations.\n\nAlso, the fact that he used a false pretense to visit the woman (as an old college friend) might be another layer. The wife might have had a right to know about these meetings, especially since they happened during their marriage. So, by not disclosing the second child, he's being dishonest, which undermines trust in the marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the first child was problematic. She's using it to tease and provoke, which is not fair. The author might feel that he's protecting himself from further conflict by not sharing. But withholding such information can lead to bigger issues if discovered later. The author's decision not to tell could be seen as a way to avoid conflict in the short term, but it's not addressing the root issues and may cause more harm in the long run.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's actions involve creating another child without his wife's knowledge or consent. Even if the original arrangement was consensual, the second donation happened after the marriage, so the wife's consent is relevant. The author should have considered this before agreeing to the second donation. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not informing his wife about the second child, regardless of her initial reaction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the wife's behavior is unkind, the author's omission of the second child is a breach of trust and transparency in the marriage. He should have disclosed it, even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
