She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being a sperm donor twice, first when he was younger and then again later without his wife knowing. His wife already knew about the first child but has been making jokes and comments about it, which makes him uncomfortable. He chose not to tell her about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, told his wife about the first child, and she was initially understanding but later started teasing him. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the same woman asked for another donation, and he did so without his wife's knowledge. The main issue is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second donation. Let's break it down. In a marriage, transparency is usually important. The author is withholding information about having another child, which is a significant life event. Even if the first child was a surprise and the wife was unkind about it, the second one is a continuation of that situation. By not telling her, he's not being honest, which can erode trust in a relationship. \n\nBut then, there's the aspect of his wife's reaction. She's been teasing and making jokes, which is not supportive. The author might feel that telling her again would lead to more conflict or hurt. However, withholding such information could lead to more problems later, especially if the second child has a sibling through the donation, which might complicate things if discovered later. \n\nAlso, from an ethical standpoint, maybe the author has a responsibility to his own children (the ones from the donation) to be truthful, but that's a different angle. The main issue here is between him and his wife. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I should consider if there's a breach of trust by keeping the second child a secret. Even if the wife's reaction is problematic, the husband's decision to not disclose the second child could be seen as hiding a significant fact. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is using the first child as a weapon in their arguments, maybe the husband has a reason to avoid giving her more ammunition. But the problem is that this secrecy could lead to greater issues. For example, if the wife finds out later, it might cause more damage than if he had been honest from the start. \n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the family dynamics. If the second child is part of the woman's life, and the author has ongoing ties to them, not telling his wife might affect their own daughter's future if there are any connections. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the husband's decision to not tell his wife about the second child appears to be a breach of trust and honesty in the marriage. Even if the wife's behavior is unkind, honesty is typically a cornerstone of a healthy relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being transparent, regardless of his wife's initial reaction.\n"
