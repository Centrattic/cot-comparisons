She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation, given that she already knew about the first one and reacted poorly.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20, and his wife found out later. She was initially understanding but then started teasing him, making jokes, and even bringing up the topic during fights. Now, there's a second child from the same woman, and he's keeping it secret to avoid more conflict.\n\nSo, the main points here: Trust and honesty in a marriage are crucial. The author made a decision to keep the second donation a secret, possibly to avoid his wife's teasing. But withholding this information could lead to lying or hiding things, which can erode trust. Even if the wife's reaction is problematic, the author's responsibility is to be truthful with his spouse, especially regarding something significant like having another child. \n\nThe wife's behavior is indeed problematic\u2014teasing and using the situation during fights is not healthy. But the author's duty to disclose might be more important. If he doesn't tell her, he's being dishonest. However, if he does tell her, he might face more conflict. But withholding such information could cause bigger issues later if discovered another way. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is key. Even if the timing or the way he chooses to tell her matters, keeping such a secret might be the wrong choice. So, the author is in the wrong for not being honest with his wife about the second child.\n"
