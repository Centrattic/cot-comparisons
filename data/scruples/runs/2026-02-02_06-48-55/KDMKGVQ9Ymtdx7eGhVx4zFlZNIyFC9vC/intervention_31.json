She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from the same sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child but not the second. His wife was initially understanding but later teased him about it, even making jokes related to their daughter and the first child. The author decided not to inform her about the second child because her reactions made him uncomfortable. He's conflicted about whether to tell her now.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. Honesty is a cornerstone in a marriage. Even if the wife's reactions are annoying, the author withholding information about another child could be seen as a lack of transparency. The second child is a significant detail that affects the family's future. For example, if the wife wants to know about half-siblings for their daughter or for legal reasons. Also, the author used the guise of visiting an old friend, which might have been deceitful. \n\nBut the wife's behavior is also a factor. She's using the information to tease and provoke, which is not healthy. However, that doesn't justify the author's secrecy. If the marriage is built on mutual trust, hiding such a major life event could erode that trust. The author might be avoiding conflict but isn't addressing the root issue. He should consider that the wife might have valid concerns or need to know for practical reasons. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife's teasing is a pattern, maybe the author has valid reasons to protect himself from constant attacks. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should address issues rather than hide. The decision to keep it secret could lead to bigger problems if discovered later. \n\nSo, while the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's secrecy about the second child is still a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
