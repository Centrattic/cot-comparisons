She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man who became a sperm donor twice when he was younger, first when he was 20 and then later when he was married. His wife found out about the first child and has been teasing him about it, so he decided not to tell her about the second child. Now he's wondering if he's wrong for keeping that secret.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. Consent and communication are usually big factors in relationships. The man did tell his wife about the first child, which is important. But after her reaction, he decided not to mention the second time he donated. The question is whether that decision is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the wife's teasing and bringing up the first child in fights is problematic. She's using it as a point to mock him, which isn't healthy. The man might feel that revealing the second child would only make things worse. However, withholding information about a second child could lead to issues if the wife discovers it later, especially regarding their daughter's potential future interactions with these half-siblings.\n\nMarriage typically requires transparency, but there's also the aspect of the wife's behavior. If she's using the first child as a weapon in arguments, maybe the root issue is her behavior rather than his secrecy. Still, not being honest about a significant fact like another child might be considered a breach of trust. But on the other hand, if he's in a vulnerable emotional situation and feels his wife isn't respecting his boundaries, his decision could be seen as self-preservation.\n\nI need to balance these factors. The man did disclose the first time, which is a good step. The second time might be a different scenario because he's now in a committed marriage. However, his wife's reaction complicates things. If he's not in a position where he can have an honest conversation without her teasing, maybe it's understandable he's holding back. But in the long run, keeping such a secret could cause more problems if discovered later. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But since the wife's behavior is toxic, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But withholding the second child is a major omission. Hmm.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A  \nThe author is in the wrong. While the wife's toxic behavior is concerning, withholding significant information about a second child born from his sperm donation breaches the trust and transparency expected in a marriage. Even if the wife's reaction is problematic, the author has a responsibility to be honest about major life decisions that could impact their family dynamic, including potential genetic relationships. Secrecy in this context, especially regarding parenthood, undermines relational integrity.",
