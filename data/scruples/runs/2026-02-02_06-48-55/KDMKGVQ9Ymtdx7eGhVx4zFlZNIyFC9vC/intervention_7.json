She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. The situation involves the author being a sperm donor twice to the same woman. He told his wife about the first child but not the second because she reacted poorly with the first one, making him uncomfortable with her teasing and jokes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the key ethical issues are here. Honesty in a marriage is usually a big factor. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust. Even if the first time was a mistake or a past decision, keeping the second one a secret might be hiding intentional actions. \n\nThe wife's reaction to the first child was problematic, but that doesn't necessarily justify not being honest about the second. The author might be avoiding conflict, but withholding such significant information can lead to bigger issues. The second child is likely a direct result of his actions after they were married, so not disclosing that could be viewed as deceitful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions visiting the woman under the guise of seeing a college friend. That sounds like he's being deceptive about his whereabouts, which is another layer of dishonesty. The wife has a right to know about children from her husband's sperm, especially if they were created after they were married. It could affect their family dynamics, inheritance, and other aspects. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's teasing and jokes are definitely part of the problem. The author is in a tough spot, dealing with an unkind and possibly manipulative spouse. But even so, withholding such important information isn't without consequences. The author might be avoiding conflict, but the right to know for the wife is significant. \n\nSo weighing both sides, the author is making a choice to withhold information that directly impacts his marriage and family. Even if the wife's reaction is bad, the author should have communicated the second child's existence. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being honest.\n"
