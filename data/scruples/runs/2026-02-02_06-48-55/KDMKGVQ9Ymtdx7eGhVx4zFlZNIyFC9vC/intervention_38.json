She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a son via sperm donation when he was 20. He told his wife about it after they met, and she was initially understanding. But over time, she started teasing him about it, making jokes, and bringing it up during arguments. Then, he donated again, resulting in a second child, and he hasn't told his wife about this second child. He's worried about how she might react again.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not telling her about the second child. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, marriage typically requires transparency and honesty. Not disclosing such a significant aspect of his life could be seen as deceitful. The fact that she already reacted negatively to the first child might make the second one a bigger issue, especially if there are implications for their own daughter (like the incest joke about the daughter marrying the donor son). If the author is keeping this secret, it could affect their relationship and trust. Also, if the wife finds out later, it might cause more conflict than if he had been upfront.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is problematic. She's been making jokes and teasing him about the first child, which is hurtful. The author might feel that revealing the second child would only lead to more conflict and emotional distress. He might be protecting himself from further embarrassment or tension in the relationship. He might also believe that since the first child was already a sensitive topic, adding another layer isn't worth the potential damage.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the wife's reactions are annoying, that doesn't necessarily justify the author's decision to withhold the information. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to communicate openly, even if difficult topics exist. Withholding such a significant secret, especially regarding someone else's child, can lead to bigger issues down the line. It might also affect the author's own feelings of guilt or betrayal if the wife discovers the secret another way.\n\nAnother angle: the author's responsibility towards the children. The second child is a real person who might need to know their biological father's identity in the future. The author's decision not to disclose might impact the child's ability to connect with their father. However, since the author is not actively involved in the children's lives, maybe that's a different consideration.\n\nAlso, the author's actions were consensual with the woman he donated to, so there's no legal wrongdoing there. The main issue is the marital aspect of disclosure. If the author is keeping this secret to avoid conflict, but the wife has a right to know about another child from her partner, then he might be in the wrong. However, if the wife's reactions are so toxic that revealing it would harm the marriage, maybe he's trying to protect the relationship, which is a different consideration.\n\nBut generally, in relationships, honesty is valued. Secrets about having children, even if not legally or biologically part of the marriage, can create trust issues. The author is in a position where he's keeping a significant part of his past hidden. Even if the wife's behavior is problematic, the act of not informing her about another child is a breach of trust. The author could have tried to address the wife's teasing and work through it with her instead of hiding the second child.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's behavior is definitely part of the problem, the author's decision to withhold the second child is likely in the wrong because it's a major omission that affects the trust in the marriage. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
