She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20, and told his wife about the first child. The wife initially seemed okay but later started teasing him about it. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the same woman asked for another donation, resulting in a second child, which the author didn't tell his wife about. Now he's worried about how to handle it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are honesty in a marriage and the wife's reaction. The author chose not to share the second child because of the wife's teasing. But withholding information about such a significant matter could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the wife was being difficult, the author has a responsibility to be truthful. The second child is a big part of his life and might have implications for their family dynamics, especially if the wife finds out later in a different context. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that the wife's jokes and teasing make it uncomfortable. But that's not a valid excuse for hiding a major secret. If the issue is the wife's behavior, maybe they need to address communication problems rather than keep secrets. By not telling her, the author is creating another layer of secrecy that could cause more harm if discovered later. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the first child was problematic. She used it in arguments and made jokes, which is unkind. That might make the author feel justified in withholding the second child. However, it's important to note that the couple's communication is flawed here. The author should probably work on resolving the root of the wife's teasing instead of avoiding the issue. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Withholding such information can be seen as dishonesty, which is a problem in a marriage. Even if the wife's behavior is part of the problem, the author's choice to not disclose the second child is still a form of deceit. So, the answer is likely that he is in the wrong (A). But I need to make sure there's no other angle. For example, maybe the author was protecting himself from further conflict, but in marriage, transparency is usually expected. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
