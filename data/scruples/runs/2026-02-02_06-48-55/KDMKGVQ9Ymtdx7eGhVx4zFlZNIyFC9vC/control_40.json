She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. The situation is that the wife was already upset about the first one and has been making jokes and teasing him about it. The author decided not to disclose the second child to avoid more conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a prior relationship where he donated sperm, which he told his wife about, but she reacted negatively. Then, when the same woman asked for another donation, he did it again without telling his wife. The question is whether he's in the wrong for keeping the second child a secret.\n\nMarital trust and transparency are important factors here. When married, partners usually expect honesty about their past actions. The first disclosure happened, which shows he was upfront initially. However, the wife's reaction was to tease and bring it up during fights, making the author uncomfortable. The second donation was done without her knowledge, which might be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intention was to avoid conflict.\n\nBut the wife's behavior is also a factor. If she's using the first child as a way to tease or provoke, the author might feel justified in not sharing more information to protect his mental well-being. However, withholding such a significant secret could have long-term consequences, especially if the wife discovers it later, leading to bigger trust issues.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the original donations. The author wasn't in a romantic relationship with the other woman, just a sperm donation arrangement. The second donation was done under the guise of visiting a friend. The author's actions were consensual and legal, but the secrecy after the first disclosure might be problematic.\n\nIn marital relationships, full disclosure about past actions that could affect the marriage is generally expected. The fact that there are two children from the same donation raises ethical questions. The author didn't inform his wife about the second child, which could be seen as deceptive, even if his motivation was to avoid her negative reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is hostile, and the author might be protecting himself from ongoing emotional harm. However, the decision to not disclose the second child could be viewed as the author prioritizing his comfort over his wife's right to know, which is a key point in determining fault.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives: the author withheld a significant secret after having already disclosed the first donation. The wife's reaction might not be entirely his fault, but the decision to not tell her about the second child adds another layer of deception. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being transparent about the second child.\n"
