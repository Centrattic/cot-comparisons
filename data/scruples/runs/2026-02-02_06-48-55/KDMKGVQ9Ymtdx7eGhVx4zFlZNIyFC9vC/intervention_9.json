She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. They provided a scenario where the author donated sperm twice, first told his wife about the first child, but not the second. The wife reacts badly to the first, so he keeps the second a secret.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a son via sperm donation when he was 20. He told his wife about it when they first met, but she started teasing him over time. Then, when his wife was pregnant with their own daughter, the same woman asked him to donate again, which he did. He hasn't told his wife about the second child because of her previous reactions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child? Let's consider the ethics here. The main issue is about honesty in a marriage. Marriages typically require transparency and trust. The author made a significant decision\u2014donating sperm again\u2014that could affect their family dynamics. By not informing his wife, he's withholding information that might be important to her.\n\nBut there's a counterpoint: the wife was already reacting negatively to the first child, making the author feel uncomfortable. He might be trying to avoid further conflict. However, even if the wife's reaction is harsh, withholding such information can lead to bigger issues down the line. The second child is another person's life, and the wife might have a right to know, especially if there are potential legal or emotional implications.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the wife uses the situation in jokes during fights, which could indicate she's using it in a hurtful way. But that doesn't justify the author's secrecy. If the wife's behavior is problematic, the author should address it directly rather than hide more information. Secrets, even well-intentioned ones, can erode trust.\n\nAnother angle: the author's responsibility. By donating sperm again, he's creating another child who might have a half-brother from a different mother. If the wife were to find out later, it could feel like a betrayal. The author might be considering the child's privacy, but in a marriage, both partners usually need to be on the same page about such significant matters.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's decision to hide the second donation seems like a breach of trust. Even if the wife's reaction is unpleasant, transparency is crucial in a marriage. The author should have addressed the issue head-on, perhaps by having a serious conversation about the wife's concerns and explaining the reasons behind his actions. Keeping it secret risks future problems and could be seen as dishonest.\n"
