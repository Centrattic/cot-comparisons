She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author donated sperm to a woman when they were a student, and later married someone else. He told his wife about the first child, but not about the second one. The wife is now making jokes and teasing him about it, which upsets him. He's considering keeping the second child a secret.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key ethical points here. Honesty in a marriage is usually a big deal. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child, even though he had a daughter of their own. The wife's reaction to the first child was already problematic, making jokes and teasing. The author might feel justified in not wanting to bring up the second child because it causes discomfort. But withholding that information could be seen as dishonesty.\n\nAlso, when the author was married to his wife, the woman he donated to asked him to donate again. He went ahead and did it, pretending it was a visit to an old college friend. That seems like a deliberate deception, especially since he was married at the time. Even if he didn't have a physical relationship with the woman, using his sperm again while married could be a breach of trust. His wife has a right to know about his actions that might affect their family dynamics, especially if there are implications for their own child's future (like the jokes about potential incest, which are not just jokes but touch on real concerns).\n\nAnother angle is the fact that the author used his sperm to create siblings for the first child, which could have genetic implications for their daughter if they were to meet. The author is hiding this to avoid teasing, but by not disclosing, he's not being transparent. Honesty is a cornerstone of a marriage, and not disclosing important information like having another child could be seen as wrong. Even if the wife's reaction is unkind, the author's responsibility to be truthful might outweigh that. \n\nHowever, the wife's behavior of making jokes and using the situation in fights is also problematic. She might be overreacting, and the author might be trying to protect himself from her teasing. But that doesn't necessarily excuse him from not telling her. The author's decision to keep the second child secret could lead to bigger issues if discovered later, which might damage trust more than if he had been upfront from the start.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is hiding a significant fact that affects both their family and his wife's right to know. Even if the wife is acting in a hurtful way, the author's decision to not disclose the second child is a breach of honesty in the marriage. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being truthful, even if the wife's reaction is part of the problem.\n"
