She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. So, first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author donated sperm when he was 20, and the recipient had a son. He told his wife when they first met, and initially, she was understanding. But over time, especially as they had their own child, she started teasing him and making jokes about it. Now, the same woman asked for a second donation, leading to another son. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child because he's uncomfortable with her reactions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: did the author have an obligation to disclose the second child? Was there a breach of trust or dishonesty? The wife was already aware of the first child, so maybe the second one is a continuation. However, by not disclosing, the author is being dishonest. \n\nThe wife's behavior is problematic, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is right to withhold information. Trust is a big part of a marriage. If the author is hiding information, even if the wife is teasing, that could lead to bigger issues. Also, the second child is another person's life, and the wife might have different concerns now that there's a second child. Maybe legal rights, or if she wants to know about her husband's past actions.\n\nBut some might argue that the author isn't a parent to the children, so it's not his responsibility to disclose. However, in a marriage, full transparency is usually expected. The author's decision to keep the second child a secret could be seen as deceitful, even if the wife's reactions are annoying. \n\nAlso, the fact that he used a sperm donor twice without his wife's knowledge might affect their relationship. The wife might have different feelings now, especially if she's concerned about the implications for their own family. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with her teasing, but that's not a valid excuse for withholding information. \n\nIn some cases, hiding such information could be considered a betrayal of trust. Even if the wife is difficult, the right approach would be to communicate and find a way to address her concerns rather than keeping secrets. So, the author is in the wrong for not disclosing the second child.\n"
