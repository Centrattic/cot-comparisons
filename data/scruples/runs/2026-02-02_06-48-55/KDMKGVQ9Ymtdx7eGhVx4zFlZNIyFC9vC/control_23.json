She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author becoming a sperm donor twice, first when he was 20 and later again when his wife was pregnant. He told his wife about the first child but not the second. His wife has been teasing him about the first child, making uncomfortable jokes, and the author is now considering not disclosing the second child because of her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author initially disclosed the first donation, which is good. However, the second donation wasn't disclosed at all. The wife's reaction to the first child is problematic\u2014teasing, making jokes about intimacy, and using it in fights. The author's reasoning for not telling her about the second child is that her reaction to the first was upsetting.\n\nNow, the question of whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, transparency is crucial, especially regarding matters that could affect the family. The author had a second child through donation without his wife's knowledge. Even though the first was disclosed, the second wasn't. The wife's behavior towards the first might be unkind, but that doesn't justify keeping another secret, especially since it's a significant aspect of their family structure.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as deceitful. If the wife knew about the second child, it might impact their relationship further, but keeping it a secret could erode trust. The wife's teasing is a red flag, indicating possible deeper issues, but the author's non-disclosure of the second child is a separate issue. Not telling her about the second child is a betrayal of trust, regardless of her behavior towards the first. The author has a responsibility to be honest, even if the wife's reaction is unpleasant. So, the author is in the wrong for not disclosing the second donation.\n"
