She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and later told his wife about it. His wife was initially understanding but started teasing him about it over time, especially after their own daughter was born. She even makes jokes related to their daughter meeting the donor's son, referencing Game of Thrones. Now, the author didn't tell her that the same woman had a second child using his sperm. He's conflicted about whether to come clean because his wife's reactions are making him uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether it was wrong not to tell his wife about the second child. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, when the author first told his wife about the first child, she was understanding but later became critical. This creates a problem because her reactions are negative and teasing. The author then withheld the second child's information to avoid further conflict. But is that justified?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, being honest in a marriage is usually valued. However, the author is in a difficult position because his wife's responses are hurtful and make him uncomfortable. There's a balance between honesty and protecting oneself from emotional harm. But in a relationship, transparency is important. If the author withheld information that could affect their family dynamics or future decisions (like if the second child's existence might come into play), that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author used his sperm a second time without his wife's knowledge might have implications. For example, if there's a chance the second child could be involved with their daughter in the future, as the wife joked about, it's a potential issue. The author's decision to keep it secret could lead to more significant problems down the line if the truth comes out another way.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is also problematic. Teasing and using the situation as a weapon during fights is not healthy. The author might feel justified in protecting himself from her negativity. But even so, withholding such information can erode trust in the marriage. If the author is being honest about the first child but not the second, that's a discrepancy in transparency.\n\nAnother angle is that the author had a prior agreement with the woman, and the second donation was done under the pretense of a college friend visit. This secrecy from the start might contribute to the current situation. The author's actions in the first place could be seen as reckless, but that's separate from the current issue of withholding the second child.\n\nIn relationships, full disclosure is usually the best approach, even if the other person's reaction is negative. The author might be in the wrong for not being truthful about the second child. While the wife's behavior is hurtful, the author's responsibility is to be honest with her. Keeping secrets about such a significant matter can lead to bigger issues later, especially if the second child's existence becomes known in another way.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child. The right course of action, even if difficult, would be to have an open and honest conversation, perhaps with the help of a counselor to address both the wife's reactions and the author's need for honesty.\n"
