She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The original situation is that he had already told her about the first child, but she started teasing him about it. Now there's a second child from the same donor, and he's not telling her because of her reaction.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are honesty in a marriage and the impact of the wife's behavior. The author might feel that since his wife was already upset and teasing about the first child, revealing the second could cause more conflict. But on the other hand, not telling her could be seen as a lack of transparency.\n\nWait, in a marriage, trust and communication are important. Even if the wife's reactions are hurtful, the author is withholding information about a significant matter\u2014another child. That might be a breach of trust. The wife has a right to know about her partner's past actions, especially if there are implications for their family. \n\nBut then again, the author's wife is using the first child as a point of contention, making jokes and bringing it up during fights. The author might be trying to protect himself from further emotional distress. However, keeping a secret about another child could create bigger issues down the line. If the wife finds out by accident, it might lead to more problems than if he had told her upfront.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author used the sperm donation to help a friend and that there's a second child might have implications if the wife wants to know about their biological children or if there are any potential family connections. The author's decision not to disclose could affect their marriage dynamics in the future.\n\nI think the main ethical issue here is about honesty and the potential consequences of secrecy. While the wife's teasing is problematic, the author's silence on the second child is an omission of important information. The answer might depend on whether the author's decision is to protect himself from his wife's reactions or to avoid conflict, but in terms of right and wrong, withholding such information could be seen as wrong because it's a matter of significant personal history that affects their relationship.\n"
