She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. So, the situation is that the author had donated sperm when he was 20, and the recipient had a son. He told his wife about this, and she was initially okay but started teasing him over time. Then, later, the same woman asked him to donate again, resulting in a second child, and he didn't tell his wife about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is whether the author has an obligation to disclose the second child to his wife. The wife was already upset about the first one, and now there's a second. Marital trust and honesty are key factors here. Even if the wife was making jokes, the author hasn't been entirely open about his past actions, which could affect their relationship.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the second child was born a few months after their own daughter. The wife's teasing about potential incest scenarios (like their daughter meeting the donor sons) suggests that she's sensitive about this. Not disclosing the second child could lead to further issues if she finds out later. The author's decision to hide this might be to avoid conflict, but it could backfire.\n\nAnother angle is the commitment to the wife. Even if the first situation was handled poorly, the author's decision to keep the second child a secret might be seen as a lack of transparency. Marriage often requires full disclosure of past actions that could affect the relationship. The author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned at the time, now present a problem because they're keeping important information hidden.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for not telling his wife\u2014because she was mean about the first child\u2014is a common but problematic justification. It's understandable to want to avoid conflict, but hiding such a significant matter (a second biological child) without explanation can erode trust. The author might be wrong because he's prioritizing his own comfort over his wife's right to know.\n\nHowever, there's a counter-argument that the wife's teasing and jokes have made the author feel uncomfortable, and maybe she's not taking it seriously. But even if the wife's reactions are inappropriate, the author's responsibility to be truthful remains. The decision to not disclose the second child could be seen as a way to protect himself but at the cost of honesty in the marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's withholding information that affects their family and relationship. Even if the wife's reaction is problematic, transparency is crucial in a marriage, and keeping such a secret could lead to more significant issues down the line. The author's choice to not tell his wife about the second child is ethically questionable, regardless of his reasons.\n"
