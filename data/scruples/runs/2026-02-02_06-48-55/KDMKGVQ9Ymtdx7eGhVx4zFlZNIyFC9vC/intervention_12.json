She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from the same sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm as a young adult, told his wife about the first child, but when she started teasing him about it, he didn't mention the second child. The wife's reaction included jokes about incest and bringing up the topic during fights. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author made a mistake by not being honest about the second donation. Marriage typically requires mutual trust and communication. The wife was already upset about the first child and continued to make it a source of teasing and conflict. In that case, the author might feel it's better not to share more to avoid further issues. \n\nBut from another angle, not informing the wife about another child from the same donation could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the wife's reactions are problematic, the author might still have a responsibility to share all relevant information, especially if there's a possibility of future complications, like the children meeting or legal/health implications.\n\nHowever, the wife's behavior here is also a factor. If she's using the information to tease and provoke, the author might feel justified in withholding more details to protect their relationship. But withholding such significant information could lead to bigger problems if discovered later, potentially causing more harm than good.\n\nThe key points are honesty in marriage vs. protecting the relationship from a partner's immature or hurtful behavior. The author's decision not to disclose might stem from self-preservation, but in a healthy relationship, transparency is usually expected. The wife's behavior is definitely problematic, but that doesn't absolve the author of responsibility to communicate fully. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because keeping a secret about a second child, especially after having already disclosed the first one, is a significant omission. The potential consequences of not knowing might outweigh the immediate discomfort caused by the wife's reactions. So the answer is A.\n"
