She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. The original post describes a situation where the author had already told his wife about the first child, but she kept teasing him about it. Now he's hiding the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. Honesty in a marriage is a big point. The author did tell her about the first donation, but maybe not all the details. The wife's reaction is problematic\u2014teasing and using it in fights\u2014but does that absolve the author of the responsibility to be completely honest?\n\nAlso, the second child is a sibling to the first, so there's a connection there. The author is hiding this information, which could affect the family dynamics. The wife might have a right to know about any potential genetic siblings for their daughter, especially if there are implications for inheritance, family planning, or if the donor kids ever meet.\n\nBut the author's motivation is understandable\u2014wanting to avoid conflict. However, withholding such significant information can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the wife's teasing is hurtful, the author's decision to not disclose the second child might cause more harm if discovered later. Trust is crucial in a marriage, and keeping secrets, even for good reasons, can damage that.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is also questionable. Using the situation in a teasing or antagonistic way isn't healthy. But the author's responsibility to be transparent might still be there regardless of her reaction. The author might need to address the communication issues rather than hiding information.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong for not being fully honest with his wife about the second donation. Even though her teasing is a problem, honesty is a fundamental part of a relationship. The right approach might be to have a serious conversation about boundaries and the impact of her teasing, rather than keeping the secret.\n"
