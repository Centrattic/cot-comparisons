She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author became a sperm donor when they were 20, had a child with a woman, told his wife after a year, and she was initially understanding. But over time, she started teasing him about it. Then, when they had their own daughter, the same woman asked him to donate again so the first child would have a sibling. He did that secretly, and now he's wondering if he's wrong for not telling his wife about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't inform his wife about the second child because of her previous reactions. But is it ethical or appropriate to withhold that information? Let's break it down.\n\nMarital trust and transparency are important. Even if the wife was making jokes, the author has a responsibility to be honest with his spouse about his past actions, especially if they affect their family. The fact that he was a sperm donor twice is a significant piece of information. The second child is another person's existence that his wife might not know about, which could impact their relationship and family dynamics.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wife's teasing makes him uncomfortable, so he avoids telling her. However, keeping such a secret might lead to bigger issues later. If the wife discovers the truth through another source, it could cause more harm than if he had been honest from the start. Also, the author's decision to not disclose the second donation might be seen as dishonest, as he's hiding information that he previously shared once but now is withholding.\n\nAnother angle is the potential consequences for the children involved. The second child exists, and if the author's wife finds out later, it could affect how she treats the child or how the author's own daughter interacts with the siblings. There's also the ethical consideration of the donor's responsibility to the child, but since he's not involved in their upbringing, maybe that's less of an issue here.\n\nHowever, the author argues that the wife's teasing is hurtful and that he's trying to protect himself from discomfort. But in a marriage, especially regarding such personal matters, honesty is generally expected. The author's choice to remain silent might be to avoid conflict, but it's not addressing the root of the problem. Instead of not telling, perhaps he should address the wife's teasing and work on communication rather than hiding more information.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is withholding important information from his spouse, which is a breach of trust. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being transparent about the second donation.\n"
