She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from the same sperm donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman in his 20s when he was a student. He told his wife about the first child, and she was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the same woman asked him to donate again, resulting in a second child. Now he's keeping this secret because he's uncomfortable with his wife's reactions.\n\nSo, the key points here are honesty in marriage, the wife's reaction, and the author's reasons for not disclosing. The author argues that he's not in the wrong because the first disclosure caused issues, and he's trying to avoid conflict. But is that a valid reason?\n\nHonesty is a cornerstone of trust in relationships. Even if the first conversation was difficult, the author didn't mention the second child, which could be seen as a deliberate omission. The wife has the right to know about all children from his sperm donations, especially since it could impact their family dynamics, potential legal issues, or emotional aspects. The author's secrecy might be causing more harm in the long run, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nHowever, the wife's teasing and inappropriate jokes (like the Game of Thrones reference) could make it hard for the author to approach the topic. But avoiding the issue by not telling her might lead to betrayal if she finds out later. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable given his wife's behavior, might breach trust because he's hiding a significant fact.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He's choosing to withhold information that his wife has a right to know. Even if the first disclosure was problematic, the second instance is another child, which is a new piece of information that affects their marriage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's hiding a significant detail about their family from his wife.\n"
