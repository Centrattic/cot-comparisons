She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm when he was 20 to a woman he met online. He told his wife about the first child after a year, and she was initially understanding. But over time, she started teasing him about it, making uncomfortable jokes, and referencing the first child during arguments. When the sperm recipient asked for another donation so the children could be siblings, he did it secretly, not telling his wife. Now he's conflicted about coming clean.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Let's consider the key points. The author had a second child through donation without his wife's knowledge. Even though the first child was disclosed, the second was not. Trust in a marriage is crucial. By keeping the second child a secret, especially after the first incident caused marital tension, the author might be breaching trust. His wife already has issues with the first situation, so hiding the second could be seen as dishonesty.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reactions (teasing, jokes, using it in fights) are problematic. The author might be protecting himself from further conflict and emotional stress. However, secrecy in a marriage can lead to bigger issues. The author's decision to not disclose might be influenced by his wife's behavior, but that doesn't necessarily absolve him of the responsibility to be honest. \n\nThere's also the aspect of informed consent. The wife, as a partner and mother to their own child, has a right to know about any potential half-siblings their child might have. This could affect family dynamics and future decisions. The author's secrecy might prevent the wife from making informed choices about their family's situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's teasing is unfair, the author's decision to withhold information about the second child is a breach of trust and transparency in the marriage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
