She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and he told his wife about the first child. But his wife started teasing him about it over time. Then, after they had their own daughter, the same woman asked for a second donation, which he did without telling his wife. Now, he's keeping this secret because of her reactions.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether not disclosing the second child is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nMarital relationships usually require honesty and transparency. Even if the wife's reactions are hurtful or teasing, withholding a significant fact like having a second child from another woman could be seen as dishonest. The author didn't mention the second child, which might affect their relationship and family dynamics. For example, if their daughter ever meets the other children or if there are medical reasons that need to be known, withholding this information could cause problems later.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior of making jokes and using the first child as a weapon in arguments isn't healthy either. The author might feel that the wife isn't respecting his past choices, which could explain his hesitation to share more. However, even if the wife is reacting poorly, the author has a responsibility to be truthful in the marriage. Secrets, especially about having other biological children, can erode trust and lead to bigger issues.\n\nAnother angle: the author had a second child, which means his wife isn't aware that he's a father to two other children. This could impact their family's future in ways they aren't prepared for. The author might be avoiding conflict, but keeping such a secret could backfire if it ever comes out unexpectedly.\n\nAlso, considering that the author used his sperm to create siblings, there's a potential future where these children might interact, and the author's wife might need to know about them for various reasons. Not being honest could complicate those situations.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's reactions are problematic, the author's decision to not disclose the second child is a breach of trust. The right thing would be to be honest, even if it's uncomfortable. So, the answer is A.\n"
