She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he donated sperm twice to a single mother when he was a student. He told his wife about the first child, but not the second. His wife has been making jokes and teasing him about it, which is why he didn't disclose the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. When he was 20, he was a student and decided to help a woman who wanted to be a single mom. He donated sperm naturally, and he told his wife about the first child. Now, the wife is giving him a hard time, making jokes about it, especially referencing Game of Thrones and the idea of their daughter meeting the donor's son. That's pretty harsh and might be why he's hesitant to tell her about the second child.\n\nIs he in the wrong for not telling her about the second donation? Well, the key points here are honesty in the relationship and the potential impact of not disclosing. He already told her about the first child, but the second one happened after their daughter was born. The wife's reactions might be part of the reason he's not telling her now. But is that a valid excuse?\n\nOn one hand, keeping a secret like having a second child from a sperm donation could be seen as dishonesty. The wife has a right to know about all aspects of her partner's past, especially if it affects their family dynamics. Not telling her might lead to more issues down the line if the second child is discovered somehow. It could also be seen as a betrayal if she values transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior\u2014teasing and using it in arguments\u2014might be contributing to his decision. If he feels that telling her would only cause more conflict and that she's not taking it seriously, maybe he's trying to protect their relationship. But is that a valid reason to withhold information? It's a tricky situation where both parties might have some responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: when he agreed to the second donation, was there any consideration of telling his wife? If he was already married and had a child with her, then the second donation would be a significant decision that affects the family. Not informing her could be a breach of trust, even if the first child was disclosed. The wife's initial reaction might be part of what's causing the problem, but the author's choice to keep the second child a secret could still be problematic.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is usually valued. Even if the initial disclosure led to a negative reaction, keeping a second secret might compound the issue. The author might be avoiding conflict, but not addressing it could lead to bigger problems. However, if the wife's teasing is malicious or hurtful, maybe the author is trying to protect himself from further emotional harm.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't tell her about the second child, which is a big omission. Even if he didn't want to face her teasing again, the fact remains that he made a significant decision without her knowledge. That could be seen as dishonest. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because withholding such information, especially after already disclosing the first child, is a breach of trust. However, his reasons for not telling her (the wife's behavior) complicate things. But ultimately, the decision to not disclose the second child might be the crux here, making him at least partially at fault.\n"
