She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The situation is that the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and his wife found out about the first child. She was initially understanding but started teasing him. Then he donated again, resulting in a second child, and he hasn't told his wife about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't disclose the second donation because his wife was making him uncomfortable. But is that a valid reason to withhold information? In relationships, honesty is usually valued. The wife's behavior might be inappropriate, teasing and making jokes about it, but that doesn't justify the husband hiding another child. \n\nThe author's actions involve creating a second child without his wife's knowledge. Even if the wife was reacting poorly to the first, the second child is a big deal. The author might be avoiding conflict by not telling, but that could lead to more significant issues later. Maybe the wife has a right to know about another child, especially if there's potential for legal or emotional complications.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author used the guise of visiting a friend to donate again suggests he was being deceptive. That deception is a problem. Even if the wife's reaction was unkind, the husband's secrecy about a second child is a breach of trust. The wife might have different expectations about family planning, and not knowing about the second child could affect their relationship and their own daughter's well-being.\n\nSo, even though the wife's teasing is not right, the author's decision to hide the second donation is a significant issue. The author is in the wrong for not being honest about the second child. The answer should be A.\n"
