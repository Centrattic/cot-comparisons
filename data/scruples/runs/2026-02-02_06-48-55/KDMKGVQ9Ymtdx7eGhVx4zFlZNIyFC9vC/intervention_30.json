She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author was a sperm donor twice, first told his wife about the first child, but not the second. The wife is teasing him about it, making jokes that bother him. He's considering whether to tell her about the second child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author didn't tell his wife about the second child because she made him uncomfortable with her reactions to the first. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a marriage regarding honesty. Generally, a marriage is built on trust and communication. If there's a significant fact that affects the family\u2014like having another child from a past relationship\u2014it's usually considered important to disclose. The author's wife is already aware of the first child, so the second one is an extension of that. Not telling her might be seen as hiding information, which could harm the trust.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he's avoiding bringing up the issue because of her teasing and the discomfort it causes. However, avoiding communication doesn't solve the problem. If the wife is unkind, the author might feel justified in not wanting to share more, but from a relationship standpoint, transparency is key. The second child is another child of his, which could have implications for the family dynamics, especially if the wife ever finds out through other means.\n\nAlso, the author's actions of visiting the woman without telling the wife could be seen as deceptive. Even if there's no physical relationship, the act of not being open about such a significant life event (having a second child) might be considered a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is problematic. Teasing and using the situation in fights isn't healthy, and the author might feel justified in protecting himself from that. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not disclosing. Even if the wife is acting poorly, withholding such information can be seen as a failure in communication.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is hiding a significant fact that affects his family. While the wife's reaction is unkind, the author's decision to withhold the second child's existence could be seen as a way to avoid conflict but at the expense of honesty in the marriage. Therefore, the answer might be that he is in the wrong for not being honest, even if the wife is also not handling it well.\n"
