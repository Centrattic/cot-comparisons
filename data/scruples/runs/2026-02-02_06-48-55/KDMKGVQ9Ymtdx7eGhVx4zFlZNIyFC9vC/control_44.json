She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author was a sperm donor when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child. The wife initially understood but later started teasing and making jokes about it. Then, after their own child was born, he donated again for the same woman to have a second child. He hasn't told his wife about this second child.\n\nNow, the key points here are about honesty in a marriage. The author is keeping a secret that could be significant. Even though the first donation was disclosed, the second one wasn't. The wife's reaction to the first might make her react badly to the second, but that's not an excuse. If the author is in a committed relationship, transparency is usually expected. By not telling her, he's hiding information that affects their family's dynamics. \n\nBut wait, maybe the author has valid reasons. The wife's teasing is uncomfortable, and he might fear more conflict. However, keeping secrets can erode trust. Also, the second child is another person's sibling; if the first child was known, the second one is part of the same situation. The author's justification is that the wife might react badly again, but that's not a valid reason to withhold the info. In a marriage, honesty is a two-way street. The author's actions could be seen as deceptive. \n\nAnother angle: The first donation was disclosed. The second is part of the same context, so not mentioning it is a lie by omission. Even if the wife is difficult about it, the author has a responsibility to be truthful. The wife might not know that there's a second child, which could affect their family planning or other aspects. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not see the second donation as something that affects their marriage. But the fact that the same woman used his sperm again is a new piece of information. The wife's initial reaction was negative, but the author hasn't addressed that. Maybe he should have discussed his boundaries with her first, rather than hiding the second donation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, withholding such information without a good reason is typically considered wrong. Even if the wife is unkind, the author's choice to not disclose the second child is a breach of trust. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
