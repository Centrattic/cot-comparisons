She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and later told his wife about it after a year. His wife was initially understanding but started teasing him and making jokes about it. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the same woman asked him to donate again, and he did without telling his wife. Now the author is wondering if not telling her about the second child was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author did tell his wife about the first child. She had issues with it, teases him, and brings it up during fights. Now, the second child is a secret. The author is concerned about her reaction. So, the question is whether keeping the second child a secret makes him wrong.\n\nIn terms of relationships, honesty is usually valued. However, there's also the aspect of the wife's reaction. If she's already using the first child as a point of contention, maybe the author is trying to avoid unnecessary conflict. But on the other hand, not disclosing the second child could be seen as a betrayal of trust, especially if she found out later. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he didn't want to add more stress during her pregnancy or provoke her further. But by keeping it secret, he's not being fully honest. Even if the wife's reaction is negative, full disclosure is typically expected in a marriage. The author might be prioritizing his own comfort over his wife's right to know. Also, the second child is a significant fact that could affect their family dynamics, especially if the wife were to discover it later in a different context. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author had the right to make that decision without her input. Even if the wife's reactions are annoying, the author's actions in continuing to donate sperm without consulting her might also be an issue. The initial decision to donate again during her pregnancy could be seen as a mistake, regardless of the secrecy. But the main question is the secrecy about the second child. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's withholding important information that affects their family. Even if the wife is being difficult, transparency is important. The author's choice to conceal the second child could harm the trust in the marriage if it's discovered later. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
