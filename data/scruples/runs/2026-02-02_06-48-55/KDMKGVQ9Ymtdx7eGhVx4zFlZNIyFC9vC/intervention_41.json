She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author donated sperm twice to a woman, told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife was initially understanding but then started teasing him about it, making him uncomfortable. Now he's keeping the second child a secret because he's worried about her reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't tell his wife about the second donation. The wife was already upset with the first one, so he's hiding the second. The question is whether this makes him in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, transparency is usually important. Even if the wife is reacting negatively, there's an argument that the author should be honest about all his actions that affect their family. The fact that he had a second child without her knowledge might be a big deal. She might have different feelings about it, even if she was annoyed about the first. Keeping secrets, especially about having another child, could be seen as dishonest.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is using the first child as a way to tease or fight with him, maybe the author feels justified in withholding the second. But even so, not disclosing something significant like another child could be a breach of trust. The author might be avoiding conflict, but the issue is whether he's being transparent. If the wife found out later, would she see it as a betrayal? The author might not have touched the woman, but the fact that he continued the donations without her knowledge is a key point.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the second donation was to give the first child a sibling. That adds another layer. The wife might have ethical or personal issues with that if she found out. The author's decision not to tell her could prevent potential conflict, but it also creates a lack of honesty in their relationship.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author is keeping a significant secret (another child) from his wife, which could be considered dishonest. Even if the wife is acting in a hurtful way, the author's choice to not disclose the second child might be seen as hiding something important. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not being transparent with his wife about the second donation.\n"
