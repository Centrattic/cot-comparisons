She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child they had through sperm donation. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and his wife found out about the first child. Initially, she was understanding, but later started teasing him about it. Now, the woman asked him to donate again, resulting in a second child. He hasn't told his wife about this second child because she's been making jokes and using it to tease him, even bringing up Game of Thrones references. He's conflicted about whether to disclose it.\n\nSo, the main question here is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. Let's consider the key points. The first thing is honesty in a marriage. If spouses aren't truthful about significant matters, it can lead to trust issues. The author didn't tell his wife about the second donation, which is a big deal. Even though she was unkind about the first one, withholding information about a second child could be seen as a betrayal of trust.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the wife's behavior. She's been using the first child as a joke and in arguments. That's not respectful, and maybe the author felt justified in keeping the second secret to avoid further conflict. But hiding such a major fact might have its own consequences. If the wife found out later, she might feel lied to, which could damage the relationship more than the teasing.\n\nAlso, considering the children involved, the author is a biological father to two children from another woman. The wife might have feelings about that, especially if they have their own child. The fact that the author used the guise of visiting a college friend to donate again shows he was trying to keep it hidden. That secrecy could be problematic, even if the wife wasn't the ideal support system.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on their own daughter. If there's a chance the daughter might meet the donor children, the author's decision not to disclose could affect how the family handles such situations. The wife's jokes about incest scenarios, while inconsiderate, highlight the potential for real-life complications if the children ever interact.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's constant teasing and bringing it up in fights is definitely not healthy. The author might have felt that not telling her was a way to protect himself from ongoing mockery. But withholding such information could prevent the wife from addressing her issues constructively. If the author had been honest, maybe they could have worked through the teasing together, leading to better communication.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author's actions involve deception by omission. While the wife's behavior is unacceptable, the author's choice to hide a significant part of his life from his spouse could be seen as wrong. Honesty is usually the foundation of a healthy marriage, and keeping a secret like this, especially about having another child, might cross a line. The second donation adds another layer that the wife isn't aware of, which could lead to more hurt if discovered later.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the wife's teasing is problematic, the author's decision to not disclose the second child is a breach of trust. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
