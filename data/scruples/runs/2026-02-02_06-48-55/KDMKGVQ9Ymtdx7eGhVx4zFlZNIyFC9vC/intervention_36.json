She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the backstory: The author met a woman online when he was 20, and she wanted to have a child without a partner. He donated sperm, and they had a son. He told his wife when they first met after a year, and initially, she was understanding. But over time, especially after they had their own daughter, she started teasing him about it. Now, the woman he donated to asked for another donation, resulting in a second son. The author kept this second donation a secret because his wife was so uncomfortable with the first one. He's now wondering if he's in the wrong for not telling her.\n\nSo, why might he be in the wrong? Well, in a marriage, transparency is usually expected. Hiding something like a second child could be seen as a betrayal or a lack of trust. Even if the first child caused tension, the second one is another significant fact that might affect their family dynamics. The wife might have a right to know because if their daughter ever meets these half-brothers, she should be aware. Also, the author might be avoiding conflict by not telling her, but it could lead to bigger issues if revealed later.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction seems unhealthy. Making jokes, especially about sensitive topics like incest, is inappropriate and could be considered emotionally abusive. If she's using this as a weapon in arguments, the author might feel justified in keeping the secret to protect himself from her teasing. However, withholding such information can also erode trust in the marriage. The author might be trying to avoid further conflict, but it's a risky strategy.\n\nAnother angle: The author's actions in donating sperm a second time might not be illegal, but the secrecy around it is problematic. The wife has a right to know about any children he has from other relationships, especially if there's a possibility of future contact. The author's decision to keep it hidden could be seen as selfish, not considering his wife's feelings in the long run, even if her initial reaction was harsh.\n\nBut then again, if the wife's behavior is toxic and he's dealing with it by not disclosing, maybe it's a form of self-preservation. However, marriage typically requires mutual honesty. The author's silence might prevent the wife from dealing with the reality now, leading to potential resentment or a bigger blowout later.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong because he's choosing to hide significant information about his actions that affect their family. Even if his wife's teasing is unkind, the right approach would be to address the issue openly, perhaps with counseling, rather than keeping a secret that could harm the marriage long-term. Secrecy in such matters usually isn't sustainable and can lead to more harm than the initial conflict.\n"
