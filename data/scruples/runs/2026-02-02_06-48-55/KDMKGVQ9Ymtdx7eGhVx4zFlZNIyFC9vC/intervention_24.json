She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the man donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, had a son, told his wife about it, and then the woman asked him to donate again, leading to a second child. He didn't tell his wife about the second child because she teased him about the first one. The question is, is he wrong for keeping this secret?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author initially told his wife about the first child, but later kept the second one a secret. His wife's reaction was teasing and bringing it up in a negative way, which made him uncomfortable. So he decided not to disclose the second child. \n\nNow, in terms of marital honesty, there's a general expectation that partners are truthful with each other. But this situation is a bit complex. The first time, he was honest. The second time, he might have done it under a different context. But by not telling his wife about the second child, is he being deceptive? It could be seen as a continuation of the same action, so maybe he should have been transparent even if it was awkward. \n\nAlso, the wife's behavior is problematic. Her teasing and using it in fights is not healthy, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the husband of responsibility. The fact that he didn't inform her about the second donation could be considered a breach of trust, especially if they have a daughter together, which complicates things further. \n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the children. If the wife finds out later, it might cause more harm. Also, the author might be justifying his secrecy by the wife's initial reaction, but that's not a valid excuse for full disclosure in a marriage. Trust and honesty are foundational. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because withholding such significant information can erode trust. Even if the wife's reaction is unkind, the right course is to communicate openly and address the issues together rather than hiding. The fact that he had a second child through the same arrangement is a major event that affects their family dynamics. Not telling her could lead to bigger problems down the line. So, the answer is A.\n"
