She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship where he donated sperm when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after they started dating. His wife was initially understanding but later became teasing and made jokes about it. Now, he kept the second child a secret because he didn't want to deal with her reactions again. \n\nSo, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second donation. Let's think about the key points here. \n\nMarriage usually requires trust and honesty. If he didn't tell her about the first donation initially, there's already a problem. But he did tell her after a year. However, her reactions were problematic. But the second donation happened after they were married and had their own child. The wife was pregnant when the second donation occurred. So, he kept this a secret from her, which she might consider a betrayal, especially since she was already upset about the first one. \n\nHe might argue that he didn't want to cause more discomfort, but withholding such significant information can be harmful. The wife could feel deceived or not trusted. On the other hand, if her reactions are hurtful and teasing, maybe he had reasons to avoid conflict. But marriage partners usually expect honesty in such matters. \n\nAlso, the fact that he used the guise of seeing an old friend to donate again suggests he was trying to hide it. That's a red flag. Even if the first time he was honest, the second time he didn't share, which is a different issue. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It seems like he's hiding a second child, which is a major life event from his spouse. Even if the first reaction was bad, not telling her the second time is likely a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
