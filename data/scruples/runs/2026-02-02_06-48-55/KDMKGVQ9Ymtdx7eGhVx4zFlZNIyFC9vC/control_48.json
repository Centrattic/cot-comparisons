She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from the same sperm donation. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after a year, and she was initially okay but later started teasing him. Now, she's making jokes about it, especially during their daughter's Game of Thrones time, with incest references. The woman had a second child using his sperm, and he didn't tell his wife. He's worried about her reaction and whether he should come clean.\n\nSo, the main question is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. The wife's reaction to the first child seems to be a key point. She's been making jokes and using it in arguments. The author's motivation is avoiding discomfort because of her past behavior. But does that justify not being honest? \n\nMarriage requires trust and transparency. Even if the wife's reaction is negative, withholding information about a second child could be seen as dishonest. The author might be avoiding conflict, but secrecy can lead to bigger issues. However, the wife's behavior is also problematic\u2014using the information in a hurtful way. \n\nOn one hand, the author didn't intend any harm with the donation and was honest about the first child. But the second child is another matter. The wife has a right to know about another child from her partner's past. The fact that the author used a fake reason to visit the woman (posing as visiting a friend) might also be an issue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's keeping a significant secret that could affect their marriage. Even if the wife's teasing is unkind, not disclosing the second child is a breach of trust. The author should consider the long-term consequences of secrecy versus the potential fallout from disclosure. But maybe the wife's behavior is also to blame for his decision to hide the second child. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. Even if the truth is uncomfortable, withholding it can lead to lying. The author might not be in the wrong entirely if the wife's reactions are extreme, but the secrecy is still a problem. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions (keeping the second child a secret) are harmful. Since the wife already knows about the first child, the second is a related secret. Not telling her could be seen as deceitful, regardless of her past behavior. So, I think the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's being dishonest, even if his reasons are understandable.\n"
