She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, had a son, told his wife about it after they started dating a year later. His wife was initially okay, but over time, especially after they had their own daughter, she started teasing him about it. Then, the same woman asked him to donate again for a second child, which he did, and he hasn't told his wife about this second child because she was already making fun of the first one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made a decision to not disclose the second child. The question is whether that's wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Marital Trust and Honesty**: In a marriage, trust and honesty are crucial. The author didn't tell his wife about the second donation. Even if the first situation was handled, keeping a secret about a second child could be seen as a breach of trust. But why did he do it? Because his wife was teasing him about the first one. That's a reason, but does that justify the secrecy?\n\n2. **Impact on Wife**: The wife's reaction was teasing and jokes, which the author found uncomfortable. However, if he's in a committed relationship, he should consider her feelings and the implications of not telling her. The second child is another person involved, potentially with their own life, family, and relationships. If the wife finds out later in a different way, it might cause more harm.\n\n3. **Intentions and Context**: The author's reasons for donating sperm initially were altruistic\u2014helping a friend. The second donation was to provide siblings for the first child. However, he kept it hidden, which could be seen as lying by omission. Even if the wife's reaction was unkind, the author has a responsibility to be honest about significant family matters.\n\n4. **Potential Consequences**: Not telling his wife means she might not know about half-siblings to their daughter, which could complicate family dynamics. If the daughter ever meets these siblings, the wife might have a right to know. The author's decision to hide it could lead to future problems when the truth comes out unexpectedly.\n\n5. **Communication Issues**: The author mentions his wife uses the first child as a way to joke or fight. Instead of keeping secrets, dealing with the communication issues might have been better. He could have addressed her teasing directly instead of hiding the second child.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is withholding significant information from his wife that affects their family. While the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's choice to hide the second donation is a breach of trust. Even if he had good intentions for donating, keeping it secret is a lie, which can harm the marriage. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he chose not to be honest about a major aspect of his life that impacts their family.\n"
