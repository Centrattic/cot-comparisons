She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation, especially after she was already upset about the first one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and after marrying his wife, he told her about the first child. The wife was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes about it. Then, he donated again without telling her, resulting in a second child. Now he's keeping this secret because he's uncomfortable with her reactions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) He was honest about the first donation but 2) Withheld the second. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second time.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is usually important. Even if the first time was discussed, the second time is a new piece of information. The wife's reaction might be part of why he's hesitant, but not disclosing a second child could be seen as a breach of trust. Especially since they have a daughter together, and the wife might expect full honesty about any children from past donations.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is also problematic. Making jokes and using the first child as a point of contention in fights might make the author reluctant to share more. However, even if her reaction was negative, the author's duty of disclosure might still be in play. The second child is another person's existence that could affect their lives, including the wife's if the children ever come into contact with their daughter.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The wife might have agreed to the marriage with knowledge of the first donation, but not the second. If the second child's existence could impact their future (like potential relationships with their daughter), not informing her could be seen as withholding important information.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: The author didn't hide the first donation but withheld the second. The wife's reaction is part of the equation, but the author's decision to not share new information could be considered a breach of trust. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not disclosing the second donation, even if the wife's behavior is part of the problem. The right approach might have been to address his concerns about her reactions and discuss the second donation openly, even if it was uncomfortable.\n"
