She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling their wife about a second child they donated sperm to. The key points here are trust, transparency in a marriage, and the wife's reaction.\n\nFirst, when they first told their wife about the first child, she was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes. Now, the author didn't tell her about the second child, which raises questions. In a marriage, honesty is usually a cornerstone. Even if the wife's reaction is frustrating, keeping a secret about a child from a sperm donation might be considered a significant omission. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wife's previous reaction made them uncomfortable, so they decided to hide the second child. But by doing so, they're not being fully transparent. The wife has a right to know about all children born from their biological material, especially if it could affect their family dynamics. Also, the author's actions could be seen as deceptive, especially since they were trying to cover it up by pretending to visit a college friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior might be part of the issue. Her teasing and bringing it up during fights could be creating a toxic environment. However, the author's decision to withhold such important information could damage trust further if discovered later. \n\nSo, while the wife's reaction is problematic, the author's secrecy about the second child likely makes them at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
