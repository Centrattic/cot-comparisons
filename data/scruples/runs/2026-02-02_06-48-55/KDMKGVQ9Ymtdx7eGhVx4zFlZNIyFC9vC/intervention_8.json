She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who became a sperm donor twice when he was younger and only told his wife about the first child. The second child was born after the email from the single mother, and he kept it a secret because his wife was making jokes and teasing him about the first one. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the man donated sperm twice, told his wife about the first child, but not the second. His wife reacts with teasing and jokes, which he finds uncomfortable. He's hiding the second child because of her reaction. \n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. Marital trust is important. Even if the wife is being unkind, withholding information about a second child might be problematic. The author had a responsibility to be honest, especially if the wife later finds out and it could cause more harm. Hiding the second child could lead to betrayal and damage their relationship more. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is clearly inappropriate. Teasing and making jokes about a sensitive topic like this is unkind and could contribute to the author's decision to hide the truth. But does that justify the author's deception? Maybe not. The author's responsibility to be truthful is crucial, regardless of the wife's reaction. \n\nAlso, there might be implications for the children. If the wife later discovers there was a second child, she might feel even more betrayed. The author's decision to not disclose could lead to bigger issues down the line. \n\nSo, even though the wife is at fault in her treatment, the author is also at fault for not being transparent. Honesty in a marriage is a key component, and withholding such information, especially regarding offspring, is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
