She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. The author already told her about the first one, but she's been making jokes and teasing him. Now he's hiding the second one.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about honesty and transparency in a marriage. The author didn't mention the second child, which he did after the first one. The wife's reaction to the first child was negative, leading him to keep the second one secret. But is that the right move?\n\nWell, in a marriage, trust is important. If one partner is hiding significant information, even if it's to avoid discomfort, it can erode trust. The wife's teasing and jokes are definitely unkind, but the author's response is to withhold another secret. That might be a problem.\n\nThe author might be trying to protect himself from more teasing, but by not telling her about the second child, he's not being honest. Even if she's acting out, withholding the truth could lead to bigger issues in the future. Maybe the author should find a way to communicate this to her, perhaps seeking couples' counseling if the teasing is a recurring issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior could be the root problem. She's using the first child as a way to tease and provoke, which isn't healthy. But that doesn't excuse the author's dishonesty. The question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer is yes because he's not being truthful with his spouse, which is a foundational aspect of a marriage. Even if the wife is acting poorly, the author's decision to hide the second child is a breach of trust. So the answer is A.\n"
