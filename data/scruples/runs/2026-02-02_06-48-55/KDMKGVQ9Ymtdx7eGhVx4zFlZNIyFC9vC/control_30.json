She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child after a year, and she was initially understanding but later started teasing and making jokes. Then, he donated again secretly after their own child was born.\n\nSo, the key points here are: was the author honest with his wife? He told her about the first child but not the second. The wife's reaction to the first one made him hesitant. But by not disclosing the second, he's hiding information that could affect their family dynamics. \n\nMarriage often requires transparency. Even if the wife was being difficult before, the author has a responsibility to be honest about his past actions that directly impact their family. The second child is another person's life, and the wife might have different feelings now, especially since they have their own child. Also, if the wife found out some other way, it could cause more trust issues. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's avoiding conflict, but withholding information is a form of deceit. The fact that he used the sperm donation twice without the wife's knowledge after their marriage suggests a lack of communication. Even if the wife was making jokes, the author should address the issue instead of hiding it. There might be legal or emotional implications if the second child ever comes into their lives. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he didn't maintain full honesty in his marriage, even if the wife's reaction was problematic. The right approach would have been to communicate openly and work through the issues rather than keeping it a secret.\n"
