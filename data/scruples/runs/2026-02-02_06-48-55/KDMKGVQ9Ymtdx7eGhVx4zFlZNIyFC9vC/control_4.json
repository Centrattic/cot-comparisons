She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and he told his wife after they met. She was initially understanding but later started teasing him about it. Then, he donated again without telling her. \n\nSo, the key points are: he kept the second donation secret because of her reaction. The question is whether that makes him wrong. \n\nMarital honesty is a big factor here. In most relationships, transparency is important, especially about children you've had or contributed to. Even if the first disclosure was met with teasing, the second secret could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, there's a context: the wife's behavior was problematic. She made jokes and used it in fights, which made the author uncomfortable. Maybe he felt he couldn't trust her with the truth. But hiding a second child is a significant omission. \n\nAlso, the second donation happened while his wife was pregnant. That's a critical time, and keeping such a secret might affect their relationship dynamics. The author might be worried about her reaction, but not disclosing could be seen as dishonesty.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have a sexual relationship, so the donation was strictly for the woman's purpose. The children aren't his biologically in a traditional sense. Still, the fact remains that he contributed to two children without his spouse knowing. \n\nIn many marriages, such a secret could be a deal-breaker. Even if the wife's teasing is unkind, the author's decision to withhold information after the first incident might be seen as his fault because he didn't address the issue properly. Instead of lying, he could have tried to have a serious conversation to set boundaries.\n\nBut the wife's behavior might have made it difficult to communicate openly. It's a complex situation where both parties have roles. However, the author's secrecy about the second child is a key issue here. So, is he in the wrong? Probably yes, because withholding such significant information can harm the trust in a marriage, regardless of the initial teasing. The right approach would have been to be honest and work through the issues together, even if it was uncomfortable.\n"
