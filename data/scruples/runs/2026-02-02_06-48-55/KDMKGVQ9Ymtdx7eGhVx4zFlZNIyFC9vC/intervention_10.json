She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation, after she was already upset about the first one.\n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman as a student. He told his wife when they were dating, and she was initially understanding. But over time, especially as their own daughter was born, she started teasing and making jokes about it. The author found this uncomfortable. Then, the woman asked him to donate again, which he did, but didn't tell his wife. Now, he's considering whether he should have told her.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. The author's reasoning is that his wife's reactions were hurtful and he wanted to avoid more conflict. But from a relationship ethics standpoint, honesty and transparency are usually key. Even if the wife's reactions are problematic, withholding information about a child could be seen as a significant betrayal. The author might be justifying his actions because he's uncomfortable with her behavior, but that doesn't necessarily absolve him of the responsibility to be honest.\n\nAlso, the author had a daughter with his wife, and now there's another child from the same sperm donation. If the wife found out later, it could cause even more issues. The fact that the author used the same donor means there's a possibility of a half-sibling relationship, which is a big deal. So, lying by omission could be harmful in the long run. Even if the wife's teasing is an issue, the author's solution was to hide a major aspect of his life, which complicates the trust in the relationship.\n\nHowever, the wife's behavior is also questionable. Her teasing and using the topic during fights is not healthy. But that doesn't mean the author is justified in not being honest. Both parties might have issues, but the author's decision to conceal the second child is a breach of trust. In any relationship, major life decisions like having a child should be mutual, even if the context is a sperm donation to someone else. The author's choice to keep this secret undermines the trust and transparency needed for a healthy marriage.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child. The answer should be A.\n"
