She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, and his wife found out about the first child. Now, the woman asked him to donate again, leading to a second child, but he hasn't told his wife about that second donation. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not telling her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. He told his wife about the first child, but not the second. His wife has been teasing him about the first one, making him uncomfortable. He's worried that telling her about the second child would make things worse. But is keeping this secret unethical or wrong?\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, honesty is usually valued. Even if the wife is being difficult, hiding information about another child might be a problem. The author is a parent to two children from the sperm donation, which could have implications for his current family. For example, if the other children are part of his life now, or if there are future considerations like medical history or legal aspects, not informing his wife could cause bigger issues later.\n\nHowever, the wife's reaction is also a factor. If she's using the first child as a way to tease or provoke him, that's not healthy. But the author's responsibility isn't just to his wife's feelings; he has a duty to be transparent with his spouse about significant life decisions, especially those involving another child. Not telling her about the second child could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the wife is being difficult.\n\nAnother angle: The author is a parent to these children. The fact that the second child was born after their own daughter might mean that his wife could be involved in their lives, perhaps even in some capacity. If the author is maintaining contact or providing support to the second child, that's a major life event that the spouse should know about. Withholding that information could be considered dishonest, regardless of the wife's behavior.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the wife makes jokes about their daughter potentially marrying the first donor child, which is inappropriate. But the author's decision to withhold the second child's existence might be a way to avoid conflict. However, this is not a valid reason to be dishonest. The right approach would be to address the wife's teasing and work on communication, rather than hiding more information.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's actions involve creating another child without his spouse's knowledge or consent. That's a significant decision that affects the family unit. Even if the wife is critical, the author should have a conversation about it, perhaps seeking couples' counseling to address the underlying issues rather than keeping secrets.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child. The secrecy is harmful to the relationship and undermines trust, even if the wife's reactions are problematic. The right course of action would be to be honest, even if it's uncomfortable, to maintain integrity in the marriage.\n"
