She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he became a sperm donor when he was 20 and had a son. He told his wife, who was his then-fianc\u00e9e, about this. She was initially understanding but later started teasing him and making jokes about it. Then, after their daughter was born, the single mother asked him to donate again for a second child. He did this secretly, without telling his wife. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong for not telling her about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made a decision to donate sperm again, which was a significant action. Since he and his wife have their own child, having another child from a sperm donation might affect their family dynamics. The wife's reaction to the first donation was problematic\u2014teasing, making jokes, bringing it up during fights. The author is hiding the second donation because he finds her reactions uncomfortable.\n\nBut is it his wrong? Well, in a marriage, transparency is usually important. Even if the wife's reactions are annoying, the author is keeping a secret about having another child from a previous relationship. That child is someone's sibling, and if the wife found out later, it could cause more issues. Also, the author might be in a position where the second child exists, so the wife might eventually find out, which could lead to more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior towards the first donation was inappropriate, and the author might be trying to protect himself from further emotional harm. But intentionally withholding such information could be considered a breach of trust in a marriage. Even if the wife is making jokes, the author has a responsibility to be honest about major life events that affect their family.\n\nAnother angle is the author's actions after the first donation. He agreed to donate again under false pretenses (visiting an old friend), which might indicate a lack of consideration for his future wife's feelings. If he knew she was going to react badly, maybe he shouldn't have continued the donations. However, the timeline is that the second donation happened after they were engaged, so maybe he thought she would be okay with it if he told her.\n\nIn terms of ethics, withholding information about having another child when you're married can be seen as dishonest. The wife's teasing is a problem, but that doesn't justify keeping the second child a secret. The author could address her behavior instead of hiding the truth. So, the author is in the wrong because he's not being transparent about a significant aspect of his past that affects their family.\n"
