She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author donated sperm as a young man, had a child with a woman, told his wife about the first child, but when his wife started teasing and making jokes about it, he decided not to tell her there was a second child. Now, he's wondering if he's in the wrong for keeping that secret.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about honesty in a marriage. The author didn't tell his wife about the second donation, which is a significant piece of information. Even though the first child was disclosed, the second one wasn't. The wife's reactions might be part of the reason he's hiding it, but does that make it okay?\n\nMarriage usually requires transparency and trust. Withholding something like having another child, even if it's through donation and not a romantic relationship, could be seen as a breach of that trust. The fact that the author went ahead with the second donation without his wife's knowledge might be problematic. Even if the first time was agreed upon, the second time might have been a separate decision that should have involved her. \n\nAlso, the wife's teasing and jokes might make the author uncomfortable, but that doesn't justify withholding information. If the wife is using it as a way to tease or fight, maybe the author should address her behavior instead of hiding the second child. The existence of another child is a big deal, especially if there are potential implications for their own daughter in terms of family dynamics or genetic relations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the second donation was a private matter, especially since the first was already disclosed. But the fact that the wife had a hard time with the first might mean that she wasn't fully on board with the idea, and the second one doubles down on that. The author's decision not to disclose could be based on protecting himself from further teasing, but it's a matter of whether he's being honest.\n\nIn terms of ethics, keeping such a significant detail hidden could be considered dishonest. Even if the first time was shared, the second time is an additional fact that affects the family. The author might be avoiding conflict, but that doesn't make it right. So, the answer might lean towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of the lack of transparency about the second child. But I need to make sure there aren't other factors. The author isn't in a relationship with the woman, just donating sperm, so it's not an affair. But the secrecy about the second donation is still a matter of full disclosure in a marriage. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
