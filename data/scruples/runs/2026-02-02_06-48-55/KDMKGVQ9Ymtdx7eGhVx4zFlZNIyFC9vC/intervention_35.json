She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation. The situation is that he had two children via sperm donation before being with his wife. He told her about the first one, which led to ongoing teasing and uncomfortable situations. Now he's hiding the second one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had a prior relationship where he donated sperm, which resulted in a child. He disclosed this to his wife initially, but her reaction became problematic. Now, a second donation led to another child, and he's keeping it secret. \n\nMarital trust and honesty are important factors. Even if the first disclosure caused issues, withholding the second instance could be seen as dishonesty. The wife has a right to know about all such children, especially if there are implications for their family. For example, if the children ever meet the author's spouse, or if there are future medical or legal considerations, transparency might be necessary.\n\nHowever, the wife's reaction is also a factor. If she's using the information to tease or provoke, the author might feel justified in not disclosing to avoid conflict. But this is a balancing act. Hiding information can erode trust in a marriage. The author might be prioritizing his comfort over his wife's right to know. \n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the children. If the author wants to maintain a relationship with both sets of children, his wife's knowledge might be important for their well-being. However, the author's story suggests that the donations were strictly non-romantic and he wasn't involved in raising the children. Still, the ethical obligation to his current spouse remains.\n\nThe decision to withhold the second child's existence could be seen as a breach of honesty, even if the first disclosure was poorly handled. In a marriage, significant omissions can lead to long-term issues. The author might be protecting himself from discomfort, but at the cost of his wife's trust. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife's teasing is insincere or malicious, the author might feel that the risk of further conflict isn't worth the disclosure. But this doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to be truthful about major life events that affect their family's dynamics.\n\nIn summary, while the wife's reaction is problematic, the author's choice to hide the second child is a breach of honesty in the marriage. Trust is a cornerstone, and withholding such information can be considered in the wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
