She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, had a kid with her, told his wife, and then later donated again, resulting in a second child. He didn't tell his wife about the second kid because she was making him uncomfortable with her teasing and jokes about the first one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Being honest in a marriage is usually considered important. The author kept a secret from his wife about having a second child via sperm donation. Even though the first child was disclosed, the second one wasn't. The wife was already upset about the first one, so maybe he was trying to avoid conflict. But withholding such a significant piece of information could be seen as dishonesty.\n\nAlso, the wife's reactions might be part of the problem. If she's using the first child as a way to tease or provoke him, that's not healthy. But does that justify the husband not telling her about the second child? Maybe not. The wife has a right to know about her partner's genetic children, especially since they have their own daughter. If the wife were to find out later, it could be more damaging. \n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the children. The author's daughter might have half-brothers from his sperm donations. If the wife finds out later, it could affect their family dynamics. The author might be putting his own comfort over his wife's right to know and the children's right to know their biological family.\n\nBut there's also the context of the wife's behavior. If she's using the first child to belittle him, maybe he's in a bad situation where honesty could lead to more conflict. Still, in a marriage, transparency is usually key. The author could be wrong for not being truthful, even if the wife's reactions are problematic. Maybe he should have addressed her issues instead of hiding the second child. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is intentionally provoking, maybe she's at fault too. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Keeping a secret about having a second child through sperm donation, especially after the wife was already informed about the first one, seems like a breach of trust. Even if the wife is being difficult, the author should have found a way to be honest and set boundaries with her teasing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong for not disclosing the second child. The right choice would be to maintain transparency in the marriage despite the wife's reactions.\n"
