She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being a sperm donor twice, once when he was 20 and then a second time after his wife got pregnant. He told his wife about the first child but not the second. His wife is making jokes and teasing him about it, which makes him uncomfortable. The question is if he's in the wrong for not telling her about the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a relationship with a woman who wanted to be a single mother. He donated sperm, and later donated again when she asked. He told his wife about the first child but not the second. The wife's reaction was problematic, using the situation to tease and make jokes, even referencing Game of Thrones. The author is now keeping the second child secret because of her reaction.\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, marriage usually involves mutual trust and honesty. The author withheld information about a second child, which could affect their family dynamics and future decisions. Even though the wife's response was unkind, the author's decision to not disclose the second child might be seen as a breach of trust. However, the wife's behavior complicates things. If she's using the first child to tease and provoke, maybe the author is justified in not wanting to cause more conflict. But withholding such significant information could lead to bigger issues down the line, especially if the second child becomes relevant in their lives. Also, the author had a responsibility to his wife once they were married to be transparent about such matters, regardless of how she reacted. Even if her reaction was negative, the author's silence could prevent her from knowing about a part of his life that might impact their family. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't maintain honesty in the marriage, even if the wife's behavior was unkind. The right approach might have been to confront the issue directly, perhaps seeking counseling together. But by keeping the second child a secret, he's not fulfilling his duty of full disclosure.\n"
