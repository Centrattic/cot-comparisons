She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author had two children through sperm donation when he was a student, and told his wife about the first one. His wife was initially understanding but started teasing him. When the donor woman asked for a second donation, he did it without telling his wife. Now he's wondering if he's wrong for not revealing the second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects here. The key points are: the author didn't inform his wife about the second donation, even though she was upset about the first. The wife's reactions included teasing and using it in arguments, which made the author uncomfortable. The author's reasoning is that he didn't want to cause more conflict.\n\nBut in a marriage, transparency is usually important. Even if the wife was being difficult, withholding such significant information could be problematic. The second child is a big deal because it's another person in the world related to him. The author might be avoiding conflict, but not sharing this could lead to bigger issues if discovered later. Also, the wife has a right to know about potential half-siblings for their daughter, especially if there are future implications like family relationships or medical history.\n\nHowever, the author did tell her about the first child. The second one happened after their daughter was born, so maybe he wanted to prevent further tension. But the act of hiding the second child could be seen as deceitful. Even if the wife was being unkind, the author might still have an obligation to be honest. There's also the aspect of the children's well-being\u2014both the donor children and their own. The author's own mental health is a factor, as he's distressed by his wife's teasing.\n\nSo, balancing transparency against the wife's behavior. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because the wife's reaction was problematic. But withholding information about a second child is generally considered wrong in a marriage. The ethical thing would be to communicate openly, even if it's uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being honest about the second child, despite the wife's initial reaction. But maybe there's a middle ground where he could approach the topic differently. Still, the act of not telling is a breach of trust, so answer A.\n"
