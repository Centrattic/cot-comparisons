She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author donated sperm as a student to a woman when he was 20, and she had a son. He told his wife about the first child after they met, but his wife started teasing him and making jokes about it, especially after they had their own daughter. Then, when the woman asked for another donation, he did it again, leading to a second son. He didn't tell his wife about the second child because he found her reactions uncomfortable and feared more teasing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, not disclosing this information to his wife could be a breach of trust. Marriage typically requires transparency, especially regarding biological children from past relationships. The wife might feel deceived if she finds out later, especially since the first donation was already a sensitive topic. The author's decision to withhold the second child's existence could be seen as hiding a significant fact that affects their family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasons for not telling are understandable. His wife's teasing and bringing up the first child in fights caused him distress. He might have thought keeping the second child a secret would prevent further conflict. However, withholding such information can lead to bigger issues if discovered later. The author's actions, while perhaps motivated by a desire to avoid conflict, could harm the trust in his marriage.\n\nAnother angle: the author's responsibility as a parent. The second child is biologically his, so his wife might have a right to know, especially if there are any future implications, like medical history or potential relationships. Also, if the author ever considers getting involved with the second child, the wife's knowledge would be important.\n\nBut the key here is the author's intent. He didn't hide the first donation initially, then lied about the second. The act of not disclosing the second child after the wife's negative reaction to the first could be seen as deceitful, even if he had good reasons. The wife deserves honesty, even if the topics are uncomfortable. The author might be prioritizing his comfort over his wife's right to know.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's decision to withhold information about the second child is a matter of trust and transparency in a marriage. The act of keeping such a significant secret, especially after a prior issue with the first, likely makes the author at fault.\n"
