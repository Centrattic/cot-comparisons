She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from a sperm donation.\n\nFirst, the context: He donated sperm when he was 20, told his wife after a year, and she was initially understanding. But over time, she started teasing him about it, making jokes, and even bringing it up during fights. Then, he donated a second time when his wife was pregnant, and he hasn't told her about the second child.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. Let's consider the factors. \n\nThe wife's reaction was negative and continued to be a source of tension. He's uncomfortable and doesn't want her to keep teasing him. On the other hand, not informing her about a significant life event (another child) could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the context shows that he's protecting himself from possible further conflict and harassment.\n\nLegally, sperm donation typically involves anonymity, and if he's not involved in the child's life, maybe it's his right to keep it private. But ethically, when it comes to a spouse, transparency is usually expected. However, the wife's behavior complicates this. If he's worried that telling her would lead to more harm (like ongoing mockery or fights), maybe withholding is a protective measure. \n\nBut there's also an argument that marriage requires full disclosure of such matters. The fact that he had a second child might have implications, especially if she discovers it later. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the wife's reaction was abusive or unreasonable, the responsibility isn't entirely on him. \n\nAnother angle: Did he have any obligation to inform her? If the wife's initial reaction was negative but manageable, maybe there's a social expectation to share important life events. But if she's been using it as a tool to provoke him, it's a different scenario. The key is the impact of his decision on their relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a case for transparency, the wife's reaction and the potential for further conflict might mitigate his wrongdoing. However, not telling her could lead to bigger issues if she finds out another way. But based on the information given, the author's actions are more about self-preservation in a context where the wife's behavior is problematic. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong.\n"
