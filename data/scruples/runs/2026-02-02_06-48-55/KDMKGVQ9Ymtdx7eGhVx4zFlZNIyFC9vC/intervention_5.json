She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about the second child from sperm donation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author donated sperm as a young student, had a child, and told his wife. Later, the same woman asked him to donate again, which he did secretly. His wife found out about the first child but not the second. She's been teasing him about it, leading him to withhold the second child's existence.\n\nThe main issue here is honesty in the marriage. The author argues that his wife's reaction was unkind and mocking, so he didn't want to add more stress by revealing the second child. But withholding such significant information could be problematic. Marital trust is crucial, and secrets can lead to bigger issues down the line. Even if the wife was teasing initially, the author's decision to hide the second child might be seen as dishonesty. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior\u2014teasing and using the situation in fights\u2014might justify the author's hesitation. However, keeping a secret about a child is a major decision. It could affect their daughter if there's a need for half-siblings or medical history. The author might be prioritizing his comfort over transparency, which could be seen as wrong. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents usually have a right to know about related children for medical and emotional reasons. The author's secrecy could impact his daughter's future. Even if the wife's reactions are difficult, the author's failure to communicate openly might harm the relationship more in the long run. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't disclose the second child, which is a significant omission affecting the marriage and family dynamics.\n"
