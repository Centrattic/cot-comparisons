She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he became a sperm donor when he was 20, and his wife found out about the first child a year after they met. She was initially understanding but started teasing him about it over time, especially after they had their own daughter. Then, when his wife was pregnant, the single mom asked him to donate again for a second child, which he did secretly. Now he's debating whether to tell his wife about the second donation because she's been making jokes and bringing it up in fights.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child. The main issue here is the decision to withhold that information. The wife already knew about the first child, but her reaction was problematic. The author is worried that telling her might make things worse, leading to more teasing or arguments.\n\nOn one hand, the author could be seen as being dishonest by not sharing all the details. Marital partners usually have an expectation of full disclosure, especially regarding children from previous relationships or donations. The second child is another factor that affects the family dynamics, even if the author didn't participate in raising them. Not telling could be a breach of trust, especially if the wife were to find out another way.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's response to the first child was hurtful and teasing. The author might feel that telling her would lead to more conflict and emotional pain. He might be trying to avoid exacerbating an already difficult situation. He could believe that the second child is not relevant because he's not involved in their lives, so he sees no need to bring it up unless the wife asks.\n\nBut then again, even if the wife's reaction was negative, the author has a responsibility in a marriage to be honest about significant matters. The existence of another child, even if it's through donation, is a major life event. By not disclosing the second child, he's hiding a part of his past that could impact their relationship. The wife might have a right to know, especially if there are any future implications, like potential family connections or medical history.\n\nAlso, the fact that he used a ruse to visit the woman (posing as a college friend) suggests he was trying to conceal the second donation, which adds to the secrecy. This could imply that he didn't consider her wife's right to know at the time, which might be a point against him.\n\nHowever, if the wife's behavior is intentionally using it as a weapon during fights, the author might feel justified in keeping it a secret to protect himself. But withholding such information can lead to bigger issues down the line if discovered.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, honesty is often valued in relationships, but so is empathy. The author is trying to avoid conflict by not sharing, which is understandable. But if the wife found out later, it might cause more harm. It's a balance between honesty and protecting the relationship from potential damage.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's decision to withhold the second donation was a breach of trust. Since he already told her about the first, but not the second, it might be seen as inconsistent. People might argue that if something is discussed once, follow-ups should be addressed. Alternatively, if the first was a sensitive topic, he might have a point in not adding more stress.\n\nBut overall, the consensus might lean towards the author being in the wrong because withholding such a significant piece of information, especially regarding another child, can be seen as dishonest. Even if the wife's reaction was difficult, transparency is generally expected in a marriage. The author's actions could be seen as prioritizing his comfort over his wife's right to know, which is a key factor in determining whether he's at fault.\n"
