She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, had a child, told his wife about the first child. The wife was initially understanding but later started teasing him about it. Then, he donated again to the same woman, resulting in a second child, and he hasn't told his wife about the second child. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not disclosing this second child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. When he told his wife about the first child, she reacted negatively over time. The author is hiding the second donation because of her reactions. But is there a duty to disclose this? Well, in a marriage, transparency is usually important. The wife's teasing and jokes are problematic, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of responsibility to be honest.\n\nThe second donation happened after their daughter was born. So the author had a child using his sperm while his wife was pregnant with their own child. That's a lot to process. The author didn't tell his wife about the second child, which means there are two other children he's biologically related to, and his wife doesn't know. That could affect their family dynamics, especially if the wife wanted to know about any children he might have from other relationships. Even though the donations were done before marriage, once married, keeping such significant information hidden could be seen as deceitful.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with the wife's teasing anymore. But by not telling the truth, he's allowing the jokes and teasing to continue based on incomplete information. If he told her about the second child, maybe the teasing would stop, or at least shift. However, he's afraid of her reaction. But isn't honesty the better choice here, even if it's uncomfortable? Hiding the second donation could be seen as a betrayal of trust, which is a serious issue in a marriage.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using sperm donation as a one-time thing, but doing it twice without his spouse's knowledge. Even if the first time was disclosed, the second time wasn't. In many relationships, any major decision involving reproduction would require mutual consent, especially after being married. The fact that he used his sperm again without informing his wife could be considered a breach of that trust.\n\nAdditionally, there's the aspect of potential legal and emotional implications. If the wife knew about the second child, she might have different feelings about her own family situation, or about the author's actions. Not telling her could lead to more hurt later if she finds out another way. The author is avoiding conflict by not disclosing, but that's not a valid reason to withhold such important information.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is withholding a significant part of his past that directly affects their relationship. Even if his wife's reactions are problematic, the right thing to do would be to be honest. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
