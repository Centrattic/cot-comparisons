She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author became a sperm donor twice when he was younger. He told his wife about the first child, but when she started teasing and making jokes about it, he didn't tell her about the second child. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong for not disclosing the second one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects. In a marriage, transparency and honesty are usually important. The author's wife was already upset about the first child, and now there's a second one. The author is hiding this information, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the wife's reactions are inappropriate, the author's decision to withhold the second child's existence might be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior is clearly causing discomfort. She's using the first child as a teasing tool, bringing up jokes about incest, and using it in arguments. In such a case, the author might feel that not disclosing the second child is a way to protect himself from further emotional harm. But is that a valid excuse for lying or withholding information?\n\nMarital trust is a big factor here. Even if the wife is being unreasonable, keeping a significant secret like a second child could lead to more issues down the line. The author might be prioritizing his own comfort over the wife's right to know, which could be seen as selfish. However, if the wife's reactions are so harmful, maybe the author is trying to avoid escalating the problem. But lying about such a major aspect of their relationship is likely to cause more damage in the long run.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions when he was younger might be seen as a past mistake, but he did disclose the first child. The second donation, however, was a decision made after the wife was pregnant. That adds another layer because he was already in a committed relationship when he decided to donate again. Even if it was under the guise of visiting a friend, the author knew the implications and chose to keep it hidden. That could be seen as a betrayal of the marital vows, regardless of the wife's behavior.\n\nSo, while the wife's teasing is not justified, the author's decision to withhold the second child's existence is likely the wrong choice. He's not being honest with his wife about a significant part of his life, which is a key component of a healthy marriage. The fact that he didn't disclose the second donation after the first one already caused issues suggests that he's aware of how problematic it is, yet he's still choosing to hide it. That points towards him being in the wrong. Even if the wife's reactions are hurtful, the lack of transparency is a mistake.\n"
