She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation after she reacted badly to the first one.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author donated sperm as a student, had a child, told his wife, but she started teasing him about it. Then, when his wife was pregnant with their daughter, the same woman asked for another donation, and he did it again. He didn't tell his wife about the second child because of her reaction. Now he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key issues here are honesty in a marriage, the wife's reaction, and the potential consequences of not disclosing. The author's reasoning is that he didn't want to cause more discomfort, but withholding such information might affect the marriage. The wife's teasing and jokes about incest could be signs of deeper issues, but the author is choosing not to share the second child to avoid conflict.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, transparency is usually valued. Even if the wife's reaction is harsh, keeping such a significant detail secret could be harmful. The second child is part of the author's life and might have implications for their family dynamics. The author might be protecting himself from embarrassment, but the wife has a right to know about all the children he has, especially if the other mother reaches out again or if the children ever meet.\n\nHowever, the wife's behavior is problematic. If she's using the first child as a weapon in arguments, that's an issue. But that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of the responsibility to be honest. There's a balance between protecting oneself from a negative reaction and maintaining trust in the marriage.\n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the author's secrecy is justified. If the wife's reaction is a result of insecurity or other issues, the author might need to address the communication problem rather than hide. But by keeping the second child a secret, the author is creating a potential for future betrayal if the truth comes out in another way.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong because withholding such significant information can harm the relationship and erode trust, regardless of the wife's initial reaction. The appropriate step would be to have an honest conversation, even if it's difficult, to address the underlying issues rather than let them fester.\n"
