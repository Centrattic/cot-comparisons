She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from the same sperm donation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author became a sperm donor in his 20s when a woman he met online needed a donor. He told his wife about the first child after they had been together for a year. His wife was initially understanding but later started teasing him about it, even making jokes about the kids meeting and having a child like Joffrey. Then, the woman asked him to donate again so the first child would have a sibling. He did this secretly, without his wife knowing, and now he's considering whether to tell her or not.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether keeping the second child a secret is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author did have a responsibility to be honest with his wife after the first donation. He mentioned that she was giving him a hard time, which might have made him avoid the topic. However, by not disclosing the second donation, he's hiding a significant part of his past and potentially affecting their relationship. The wife's reactions are inappropriate and cruel, using the situation as a weapon in arguments. But the author's secrecy could also be seen as dishonesty, especially since there's a second child involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was donating sperm for a noble reason\u2014helping someone have a family. The first time was disclosed, but the second time was done in secret because the wife's reactions were hurtful. The author might feel that the wife's behavior is not his fault; she's the one making it a joke. However, by not informing her about the second child, he's adding another layer of deception, which can erode trust in a marriage.\n\nI should consider the impact of both the wife's behavior and the author's secrecy. The wife's teasing is definitely crossing boundaries, but the author's decision to conceal the second child could be seen as a way to protect himself from her mockery, which isn't right. In a marriage, honesty is crucial, and keeping such a secret might lead to bigger issues if discovered later. The author might be in the wrong because he's not being fully transparent, even if the wife is acting poorly. However, the wife's behavior is also problematic because she's using the situation to mock him. But the question is specifically about the author's actions.\n\nSo, the author knew he had a second child but didn't inform his wife. Even though the first time was a mistake in terms of her reaction, the second time is a continuation without her knowledge. That's a significant secret. Even if the wife is acting inappropriately, the author's decision to hide the second child could be considered wrong because it's a matter of trust and honesty in the relationship. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
