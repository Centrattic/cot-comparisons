She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not telling his wife about a second child from sperm donation after she reacted negatively to the first one. \n\nFirst, the author donated sperm to a woman when he was 20, leading to a son. He told his wife about this when they met, and initially, she was understanding. However, over time, especially as they had their own daughter, she started teasing him about it, making jokes, and even referencing Game of Thrones to imply potential incest scenarios. This discomfort made him decide not to disclose the second child, which he had anonymously after his wife's pregnancy.\n\nNow, the key points here are honesty in a marriage versus the wife's behavior. The author is withholding information because his wife's reactions are hurtful and make him uncomfortable. On one hand, marriage requires transparency, so not disclosing a second child might be seen as deceitful. On the other hand, if the wife is using this as a weapon in arguments or just being cruel, maybe the author is justified in protecting himself from further emotional harm.\n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the wife is acting unkindly, the author might not be at fault for not sharing more. However, withholding such significant information could also be harmful in the long run, damaging trust. The author might be avoiding conflict, but is that a valid reason? It's a tough balance between self-preservation and marital honesty.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because even if the wife's behavior is hurtful, hiding a second child is a major omission. The wife has a right to know about potential half-siblings for their children, and the author's decision to keep it secret could have long-term consequences. However, the wife's teasing might have contributed to the author's decision, but that doesn't make it right. The right choice would be to communicate openly, even if it's uncomfortable, to maintain trust. So, answer A.\n"
