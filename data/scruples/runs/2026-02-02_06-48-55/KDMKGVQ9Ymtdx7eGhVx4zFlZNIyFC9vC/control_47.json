She wanted to become a mother, but wanted to do so without a partner and raise the kid(s) alone. I agreed to donate my sperm to her to help her. She had a son, and I have told my wife about this when she and I first met a year after the fact. My wife was understanding at first but as time went by and we had a daughter of our own, my wife began giving me a hard time for it. She teases me with it. Asks too many questions. Like whether or not I donated \"naturally\" or just in a cup. I swear that's how it went about... I never touched the woman other then to shake her hand. Maybe she was asexual or something, hence the whole single mother thing. I don't know, and it's up to her. It was strictly professional.\n\nMy wife and I have a daughter of our own. During the time my wife, then-fianc\u00e9e, was pregnant, the woman I donated sperm to contacted me on my e-mail and asked me to donate again, so that her son would have a full sibling. I agreed, visited her under the guise of seeing an old college buddy and deposited my sperm once more. A second son was born, a few months after my wife and I had our first child.\n\nI've decided never to tell my wife about the second donor kid because she reacted so weirdly with the first one, and kept joking about it and teasing me with it. It makes me uncomfortable. Ever since Game of Thrones brought back the whole incest hype (my wife and I watch together) she's made a ton of jokes about \"what if our daughter somehow met your donor son and they married and had a Joffrey-esque kid?)...\n\nThe whole way my wife responds to the fact that I was once a sperm donor weirds me out to the point where I do not want to disclose the fact that I was a sperm donor a second (and last) time after. Sometimes I think I should still tell her, but I'm not sure... if I would, how would I even bring it up and how would I make her stop teasing me with it or bringing it up in fights when she's upset and trying to get a reaction out of me? Don't know what to do with all this, so some advice would be welcome.\n\n**TL;DR:** I was a sperm donor in my early twenties and told it to my wife but she was so weird about the whole thing that I never told her the woman I donated once to has a second child born to my sperm.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a man who donated sperm twice to a woman he met online when he was 20. He told his wife about the first child, but the second one he kept secret. His wife has been teasing him and making jokes about the first donation, which is making him uncomfortable. He's deciding whether to tell her about the second child or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author donated sperm without being involved in a romantic relationship with the woman. He told his wife about the first child, but she reacted negatively over time, using it as teasing and bringing it up during arguments. The second donation happened after his wife was pregnant, and he hid it because of her reactions.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's look at the facts. When he first found out he was a sperm donor, he did disclose it to his wife. That's important because he was honest initially. However, after the first child, when the wife's reaction became problematic, he decided to hide the second donation. The question is whether he has a moral obligation to disclose the second child, especially since he already had a child with his wife.\n\nMarriage usually requires transparency and trust. By not telling his wife about the second child, he's withholding information that could affect their family dynamics. The wife's teasing and jokes might indicate that she's not over the first situation, so adding another layer of secrecy could strain their relationship further. However, the author's reasons are based on his discomfort and the wife's previous reactions. Is he justified in keeping it a secret?\n\nAlso, the fact that he used a sperm donation for a second time after his wife was pregnant could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the first donation was consensual and disclosed, the second one happened after they were married and had their own child. The wife has a right to know about all children that he's responsible for, especially if there's a possibility of future contact or if it affects their family's genetic background.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior in teasing and making jokes is unkind and might have contributed to the author's decision to keep the second child a secret. But that doesn't necessarily make the author right. Secrecy in marriage can lead to bigger issues down the line. The author might be protecting himself from further conflict, but withholding such significant information could be considered dishonest.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the second child. If the child ever learns about the father's identity, it could affect their relationship with their mother and possibly their genetic family. The author might have a responsibility to ensure that the child can access their family history, which could involve informing the wife if she has a role in the child's life, though the scenario doesn't mention her involvement with the second child.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, sperm donation typically requires consent and understanding from all parties. The author's actions, especially visiting the woman under the guise of meeting a friend, could be seen as deceptive. However, the legal aspect here isn't addressed, but the question is about being in the wrong morally.\n\nOverall, while the wife's behavior is problematic, the author's decision to hide the second child is a form of dishonesty that could harm their relationship. The key issue is that he is keeping a significant secret related to his role as a parent, which affects both his wife and the children. Even if the wife's reactions are unkind, the author has an obligation to his wife to be honest, especially about matters that could affect their family. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not disclosing the second child.\n"
