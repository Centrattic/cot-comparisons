A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about continuing to be friends with Liz. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with his wife where he told her he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her. However, he continued to text Liz at work. When his wife found out through checking his phone, he's now asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the lie. The author made a promise to his wife not to be friends with Liz but continued the friendship. The question is whether this makes him wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, honesty is crucial. Even if his wife's behavior was moody or unreasonable, lying to her would generally be considered a breach of trust. The fact that he lied about a specific promise he made to her seems to be the core of the problem. \n\nBut there's also the part where his wife went through his phone. That's a privacy violation, which is definitely wrong. However, the user is focused on the author's actions. Even if the wife did something wrong, the author still chose to lie, which is his own issue.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider if there's any nuance. For example, maybe the author felt he had no choice to lie to maintain his job relationships. But in a healthy relationship, communication is key. Instead of lying, he should have discussed his concerns with his wife again or found another solution. \n\nSo, the lie itself is the main problem here. The author chose deception over honesty, which typically leads to more issues. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
