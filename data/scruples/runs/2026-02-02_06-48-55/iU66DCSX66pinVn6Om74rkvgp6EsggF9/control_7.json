  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for lying to my wife?\nHopefully this is not as cut and dry as it may seem. A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about lying to his wife about ending contact with a female coworker, Liz. The user wants to know if he's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, the author initially lied to his wife about not being friends with Liz to appease her. But they stayed in contact at work. Then his wife found out by checking his phone and is upset. \n\nThe key points here are honesty in a relationship and the act of lying. The author admitted he told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz, but continued texting her. That's a lie. Even if the wife was being unreasonable or \"that time of the month,\" the husband's dishonesty is a problem. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and lying, even to avoid conflict, can damage that trust.\n\nAlso, the wife's action of checking his phone is questionable. Privacy is important, but her reaction is in response to his lie. However, the primary issue here is the husband's deception. He had a choice to be honest or lie. Even if he was trying to avoid conflict, lying isn't the solution. The wife's anger stems from discovering the lie, which validates her initial concern about his friendship with Liz. \n\nSo, the husband is in the wrong for not being truthful. The wife's action is not excused, but the main fault lies with the husband's dishonesty. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
