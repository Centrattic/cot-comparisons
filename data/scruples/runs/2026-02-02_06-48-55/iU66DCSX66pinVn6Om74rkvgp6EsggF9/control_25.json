A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with his wife where he told her he wasn't friends with Liz anymore to appease her after a misunderstanding. However, he kept texting Liz at work. The wife later found out by checking his phone and is upset about the lie.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author lied to his wife, which is a big issue in a relationship. Trust is crucial, and lying can erode that. Even if the reason was to avoid conflict or to comply with his wife's request, the act of lying is still a breach of trust. The wife's reaction is understandable because she felt deceived when she found out the truth. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife went through his phone without permission. That's an invasion of privacy, which isn't right either. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Both parties have faults here, but the core issue is the lie. The author had a choice to either be honest or to lie. Since he chose to lie, even if it was to avoid conflict, that's on him. The wife's action of checking the phone is a separate issue, but it doesn't justify the lie. \n\nAlso, the context about the wife being moody during that time might explain her behavior, but it doesn't absolve the author of his responsibility to be truthful. In a healthy relationship, honesty is key. The author should have addressed the situation by being transparent instead of lying. \n\nSo, the answer is that the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about the friendship with Liz.\n"
