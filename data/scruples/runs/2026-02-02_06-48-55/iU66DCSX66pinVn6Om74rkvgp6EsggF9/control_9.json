A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a conversation with his wife where he said he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her. But in reality, he continued to communicate with Liz at work. The key point here is the lie. He told his wife he wasn't in contact, but he was. \n\nNow, the wife found out by checking his phone. The author is upset about her going through his phone, but the question is whether he's in the wrong for lying. Trust is a big part of relationships. If he made a promise to not be friends and then broke it without telling her, that's a breach of trust. Even if his reason was to keep the peace, lying isn't usually a good solution. \n\nOn the flip side, the wife's method of checking his phone is also problematic. However, the main issue here is the author's dishonesty. He promised something and then didn't follow through, which is a clear instance of lying. The wife's action is wrong, but the author's lie is what initiated the conflict.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is in the wrong because he lied about not being friends with Liz. His actions broke the trust he had with his wife. Even though the wife's response was also inappropriate, the initial wrongdoing comes from the author.\n"
