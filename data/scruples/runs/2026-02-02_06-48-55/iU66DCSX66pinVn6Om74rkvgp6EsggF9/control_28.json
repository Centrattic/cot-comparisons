A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author lied to his wife about not being friends with Liz after their initial conflict. The wife found out he was still texting Liz and got angry. The author is now questioning if he was wrong for not telling the truth, or if the wife is the problem for checking his phone.\n\nFirst, the lie. The author promised his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to make her feel better. But he continued texting her. That's a lie by omission or active deception. Trust is important in a relationship, and lying about friendships can be a big deal. Even if it was to appease her, keeping the lie going without her knowing is problematic.\n\nThen there's the wife checking his phone. While that's a privacy issue, the author's lie might have given her a reason to do that. She might have felt betrayed, prompting her to check his phone. But that doesn't justify her action. However, the author's initial lie is the root cause here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The lie about continuing the friendship is a breach of trust. Even if the wife's method of finding out was intrusive, the author's action started the conflict. So, the author is at fault here for not being honest. The answer should be A.\n"
