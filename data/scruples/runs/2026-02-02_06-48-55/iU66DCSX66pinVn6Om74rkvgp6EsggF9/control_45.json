A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the initial problem started when the author was texting with Liz, a female coworker, and his wife misunderstood the conversation. The wife now thinks Liz is trying to seduce the author and that he's badmouthing her. Because of this, the wife wanted the author to stop being friends with Liz. The author agreed but kept the friendship secret.\n\nNow, the wife found out he's still texting Liz, which he lied about. The author is wondering if he did wrong by not telling the truth or if the wife is overstepping by checking his phone.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author lied about ending the friendship, and the wife went through his phone. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the lie.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Even if the wife's actions (checking the phone) were questionable, the author's lie could be seen as a breach of trust. Lying to a spouse, especially about not following through on a promise (to stop being friends), is generally considered wrong. The author's intent was to appease the wife but then chose deceit over honesty, which can harm the relationship more in the long run. \n\nThe wife's actions might be problematic too, but the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. The lie, regardless of the reason, is a moral issue here. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
