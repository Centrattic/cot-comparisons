A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about him lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, he told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz because she was upset about Liz and him talking. But he kept texting her, thinking he was just being friends at work. Then, when his wife found out and got angry, he's asking if he's the asshole for lying, or if his wife is in the wrong for checking his phone.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is the lie. He promised his wife he wouldn't be in contact with Liz, but he continued to text her. That's a lie. Even if he thought it was just work-related, the fact that he didn't tell his wife the truth is problematic. Honesty in a relationship is usually expected, especially when there's a history of jealousy or trust issues. \n\nThen there's the wife's part about checking his phone. She went through his phone without permission. That's a breach of privacy. But the author's lie might have justified her actions, depending on the context. However, even if someone does something wrong, the other person's response isn't always the best. \n\nSo, the author lied, which is a problem. The wife invaded his privacy, which is also wrong. The question is who's more at fault. Since the author broke his promise first, his lie is the initial wrongdoing. The wife's action is a reaction, but it's still wrong. However, in relationship advice, usually, the person who lies is considered more in the wrong because they broke trust first. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because he lied about not being friends with Liz anymore, even though the wife's action was also wrong. The lie is the primary issue here.\n"
