A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with his wife about Liz, a coworker, and her relationship issues. The wife misunderstood the conversation, thinking the author was implying Liz was interested in him. The wife then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, he said he wouldn't, but in reality, he continued the friendship. Fast forward, the wife finds out and is upset because he lied.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author lie? Yes, he told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz, but continued to text her. The wife found out through snooping, which complicates things. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, and I need to agree or disagree. Let's break it down. Lying about ending a friendship is a breach of trust. Marital trust is crucial, and lying, even to please a partner, can damage that. The wife's action of checking his phone is questionable, but the author's lie is a direct issue. The wife might have had a valid concern if she felt threatened by Liz, but the author's response was to lie instead of addressing her fears honestly.\n\nHowever, there's context. The wife's initial reaction might have been based on a misunderstanding, and the author tried to comply by saying he'd stop. But continued contact shows he didn't take her feelings seriously. The author's lie perpetuated the problem. Even if the wife's method of checking the phone is wrong, the author's dishonesty is a separate issue.\n\nSo, the author's actions (lying) contributed to the conflict. The wife's actions (snooping) are also problematic, but that doesn't absolve the author. In most relationships, honesty is key, and lying to \"appease\" a partner can backfire. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for the lie, even if the wife's actions were also inappropriate.\n"
