A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with his wife where he said he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her. But actually, he and Liz stayed friends at work. Later, his wife found out through his phone that he was still in contact with Liz and is upset about the lie. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for not telling the truth, or if his wife is the problem for going through his phone.\n\nI need to evaluate the ethical aspects here. The key points are:\n\n1. **The Lie**: The author told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore, but continued to be friends. That's a direct lie. Even if it was to appease her, lying is generally wrong in a relationship because it erodes trust.\n\n2. **Marital Trust**: Trust is crucial. The wife's anger is justified because she found out through her own means, which might be a red flag, but the husband's lie is the root issue here. If the husband had been honest from the start, maybe the situation could have been resolved differently.\n\n3. **Wife's Actions**: The wife went through his phone, which is a privacy violation. However, her actions might be a reaction to feeling betrayed by the lie. The author's dishonesty led her to take that step, which complicates things.\n\n4. **Context of the Lie**: The author mentions that he tried to convince her otherwise when she misunderstood the conversation with Liz. But he still lied about cutting off the friendship. Even if the initial misunderstanding was her fault, the lie was his choice.\n\n5. **Current Conflict**: The wife's anger is tied to the lie. The author's decision to lie, even to maintain peace, is a breach of trust. The wife's method of finding out (checking the phone) is wrong, but the husband's lie is the main issue.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in the wrong because he chose to lie to his wife despite knowing she was upset. Even if the wife's reaction was extreme, the lie is the primary problem here. The wife's privacy violation is also wrong, but the husband's dishonesty is the catalyst for the conflict. So the answer is A.\n"
