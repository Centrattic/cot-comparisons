A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by lying to his wife about maintaining a friendship with Liz after telling her he wouldn't. The key points here are the initial lie and the wife checking his phone.\n\nFirst, the author lied to his wife. He promised not to be friends with Liz anymore, but he continued to text her at work. That's a breach of trust. Even if the wife's method of checking the phone was invasive, the author's dishonesty is a problem. Relationships often require honesty, and lying about communication with a coworker that the wife is concerned about can lead to more issues.\n\nThe wife's actions might not be right either\u2014going through someone's phone without permission is a privacy violation. But the question is about who is at fault here. The author's lie is a significant issue. People generally expect their partners to be truthful, especially after a conflict that required a promise. The author's decision to keep the friendship despite promising otherwise shows a lack of respect for his wife's feelings and boundaries.\n\nSo even though the wife's actions were wrong, the author's dishonesty is the root of the problem. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
