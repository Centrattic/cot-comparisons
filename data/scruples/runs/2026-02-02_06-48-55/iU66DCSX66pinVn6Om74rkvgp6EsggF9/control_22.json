A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about lying to his wife about not talking to a female coworker named Liz. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author was texting Liz when she was going through a breakup. He mentioned loving his wife and how Liz might need to end her relationship if she didn't feel the same. The wife misunderstood this, thinking Liz wanted the author and thought he was talking badly about her. The wife then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore, which he agreed to, but continued the friendship secretly. Later, the wife found out by checking his phone and is upset about the lie.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. From what I know about relationships, honesty is crucial. Even if the wife was being unreasonable or had her own issues (like being moody), the author chose to lie about his friendship with Liz. Lying, regardless of the reason, is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust. The wife had the right to expect honesty, even if she was being difficult. The fact that he kept the friendship despite promising not to shows a lack of respect for her feelings and the trust they should have. The wife checking the phone might be a privacy issue, but the author's lie was the initial problem. So, the main issue here is the deception. Even if the wife acted out, the author should have maintained honesty. So the answer is likely A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
