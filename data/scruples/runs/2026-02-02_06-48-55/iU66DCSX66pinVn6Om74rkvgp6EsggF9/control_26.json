A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a conversation with his wife where he told her he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her. However, he continued to be friends with her at work. Then, when his wife found out by checking his phone, he's asking if he's the one in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is honesty in the relationship. The wife asked him not to be friends with Liz, and he promised not to. But he kept the friendship going. That's a lie by omission or active deception, depending on how he handled it. Even if he thought it was to appease her, he didn't follow through with the promise he made. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife went through his phone without permission, which is a violation of privacy. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even though the wife's action is questionable, the fact remains that he lied to her. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and breaking a promise, even if done to avoid conflict, can be damaging. \n\nSome might argue that the wife shouldn't have checked his phone, but the core issue here is the author's dishonesty. He made a commitment and didn't keep it. So, he's the one who initiated the deceit. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he lied about ending the friendship with Liz. The wife's action is also problematic, but the question focuses on the author's responsibility.\n"
