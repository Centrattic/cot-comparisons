A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about lying to his wife about not being friends with a coworker, Liz, after an argument. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author was telling his wife about Liz's messages. There was a misunderstanding where the wife thought the author was suggesting Liz wanted to have sex with him and talk badly about her. The wife then wanted the author to stop being friends with Liz. He agreed not to, but continued to be friends at work. Then the wife found out through his phone that he was still texting Liz. She went through his phone, which he didn't like.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the deception. The author made a promise to his wife that he would no longer be friends with Liz, but he broke that promise. Even if it was to appease her, lying about maintaining contact is a problem. Honesty in relationships is crucial. The wife's actions of checking the phone are also questionable, but the author's dishonesty is the key point here. His actions led to a breach of trust, which is a significant issue in any relationship. Even if there was a misunderstanding initially, the author should have addressed it honestly instead of lying about cutting ties. So, I think the author is in the wrong here.\n"
