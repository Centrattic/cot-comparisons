A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a female coworker, Liz, who was going through a relationship issue. He texted his wife about it, and during that conversation, he made a comment that made his wife think he was insinuating he wanted to have sex with Liz. The wife got upset and told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, the author said he wouldn't, but in reality, he continued to be friends at work. Now, the wife found out he was still texting Liz, and she's angry. The author is asking if he's at fault for lying about not being friends with Liz, or if the wife is the problem for going through his phone and for her jealousy.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author lied about his friendship with Liz to his wife. Even though his wife was being emotional and jealous, the author chose to deceive her instead of being honest. The wife, on the other hand, took a privacy invasion by checking his phone. \n\nBut the question is, is the author in the wrong? Well, lying in a relationship is generally considered a breach of trust. Even if the wife was at fault for her initial accusations, the author's decision to continue the friendship and lie about it could have been handled better. He might have thought he was protecting the relationship by appeasing her, but deception can lead to more problems. \n\nHowever, the wife's actions of checking his phone are also problematic because invading someone's privacy is not acceptable. But the author's lie was the initial issue. So even though the wife's method of finding out was wrong, the author's deception is still a problem. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. The author should have addressed the situation by having an open conversation instead of lying. Maybe there's a middle ground where he could have explained that they are only colleagues and that he respects his wife's feelings. But instead, he chose to lie, which is why he's in the wrong here. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
