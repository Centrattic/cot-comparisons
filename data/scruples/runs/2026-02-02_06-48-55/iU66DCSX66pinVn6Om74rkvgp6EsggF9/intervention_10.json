A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with his wife about a colleague's relationship issues. During that conversation, his wife misunderstood the texts and assumed the author was saying Liz was interested in him. The wife then demanded he stop being friends with Liz. He agreed not to, but continued the friendship secretly. Now, the wife found out through checking his phone and is angry.\n\nThe key points here are the initial misunderstanding and the subsequent deception. The author didn't actually break any explicit rule about being friends with Liz, but he made a promise to his wife to stop being friends. Even if the wife's demand was based on a misunderstanding, the author chose to lie about maintaining the friendship. \n\nTrust is a big factor in relationships. By lying, the author breached that trust. It doesn't matter if the wife was acting out of jealousy or misunderstanding; keeping a secret promise is still a lie. Additionally, the wife's method of checking his phone is invasive, but that doesn't justify the lie. The author had the opportunity to be honest and probably could have explained the situation better. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for lying seems to be to appease the wife but then not following through, which is a form of manipulation. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, the right approach would be to address the issue with her rather than lie. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong.\n"
