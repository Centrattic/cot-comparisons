A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The situation involves a coworker, Liz, who was dating someone who lied to her. The author was texting Liz and shared that conversation with his wife, but the wife misunderstood, thinking the author was flirting with Liz. She then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author agreed but secretly continued the friendship. The wife later found out and is upset. Now the author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for not telling the truth about still being friends with Liz, or if his wife is the problem for checking his phone.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author lied to his wife about ending the friendship with Liz. He made a promise not to be friends with her to appease his wife but continued the friendship. That's a breach of trust. Even if the wife's actions (checking his phone) were wrong, the author's dishonesty is a major issue. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and lying about such a thing can be a big deal. The wife might feel betrayed, regardless of her being overreactive or checking his phone. The author could have handled it better by being honest from the start instead of lying. The wife's actions are bad, but the author's lie is a significant problem. So, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
