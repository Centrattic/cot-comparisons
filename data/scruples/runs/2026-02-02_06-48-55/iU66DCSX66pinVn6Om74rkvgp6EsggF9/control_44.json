A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with Liz where he advised her about her relationship. His wife misunderstood the texts, thinking Liz was interested in the author and that he was badmouthing her. The wife then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author agreed not to, but kept in touch secretly. Later, the wife found out and is angry, and the author is now considering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are deception and trust. The author lied about cutting off contact with Liz. Even though the wife's initial reaction was based on a misunderstanding, the author chose to lie instead of addressing the issue honestly. Lying in a relationship can erode trust, and even if the wife was acting out of insecurity or mood swings, the author's decision to continue the friendship behind her back is a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the wife checking his phone is a separate issue, but the author's lie is the main point here. By not being truthful, he's hiding something he agreed to change. Even if the wife's actions were overstepping, the author's dishonesty is a problem. Relationships require honesty, and lying to avoid conflict or to appease someone isn't a good solution. So the author is in the wrong for not being truthful and maintaining the friendship despite his agreement to stop. \n\nAnswer: A\n"
