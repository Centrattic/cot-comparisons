A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the wrong thing here. So the situation is about a guy who lied to his wife about keeping in touch with a female coworker named Liz. The wife found out he was still texting her, and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the guy told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her. But he kept texting her. That's a lie. The wife went through his phone and found out. Now he's split between whether he's wrong for lying or if the wife is wrong for checking his phone.\n\nSo, the main issue here is honesty in a relationship. When someone asks you to stop doing something, and you don't, that's a breach of trust. Even if the wife checked the phone, which might not be great, the guy's action of lying is a significant factor. Relationships require trust, and lying to a partner is a common way that trust breaks down. \n\nThe guy's reasoning might be that he just wanted to keep the peace, but lying isn't a good solution. Also, the wife's anger could be partly due to her mood, but that doesn't excuse the guy's dishonesty. The wife's action of checking the phone is invasive, but the guy should have been honest in the first place. \n\nSo, in terms of who is at fault, the author is the one who lied about maintaining a friendship. The wife's action of checking the phone is a problem, but the root issue is his dishonesty. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
