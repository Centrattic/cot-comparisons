A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz after promising to stop. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was confiding in Liz, a female coworker, about his wife. During that conversation, Liz mentioned her doubts about her girlfriend, and the author advised her to end the relationship if she didn't feel that strong about her. The wife misinterpreted this as the author being interested in Liz, leading her to demand he stop being friends with her. The author agreed but didn't actually cut off the friendship, leading to the wife discovering the continued texts.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author gave a promise to not be friends with Liz to appease his wife but didn't follow through. Then, when confronted, he lied about it. The wife checked his phone and found out the truth. \n\nNow, considering the ethics of this. Honesty in a relationship is usually expected. The author made a commitment to stop being friends with Liz, but he broke that promise and lied about it. Even if the wife's behavior (like checking the phone) might be seen as overstepping, the author's actions involved deceit. \n\nBut wait, there's context. The wife might have acted out of jealousy due to a past misunderstanding. The author's initial advice to Liz could have been misinterpreted, leading to the wife's mistrust. However, once the author promised to stop, he should have followed through. If he couldn't, he should have been honest from the start. \n\nAlso, the wife checking the phone is a privacy issue, but that doesn't justify the author's lying. Both actions are problematic, but the question is about who is in the wrong. The author lied and broke a promise, which is a significant breach of trust. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he lied about ceasing the friendship and continued to keep it despite his promise. Even if the wife's actions are also questionable, the author's dishonesty is the primary issue here.\n"
