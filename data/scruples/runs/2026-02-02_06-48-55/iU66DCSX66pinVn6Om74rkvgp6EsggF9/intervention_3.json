A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author lied to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The wife had a problem with the author talking to Liz, especially after some texts that made her upset. The author promised to stop being friends with Liz to appease her, but in reality, they stayed in touch. Now, the wife found out through her period of moodiness and checking his phone.\n\nThe user, the author, is asking if they're in the wrong for not telling his wife the truth about still being friends with Liz. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the key points here. The author made a promise to the wife and then broke it. Even if the wife's behavior was questionable (like checking his phone), the author's lie is a problem. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and lying about friendship status, especially after conflict, can be seen as a breach of trust. The author's decision to keep the friendship under wraps without transparency could have been avoided if they had honest communication. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's method of checking the phone isn't great either. However, the author's deception is the main issue here. Even if the wife had a valid reason to be upset, the author's lie still stands. The fact that the author continued the friendship despite promising to stop is a key factor. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the author thought they were protecting the friendship, but deception isn't justified. The wife's anger might be overblown, but the author's actions contributed to the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they lied about a promise they made to their spouse. The act of lying is the primary issue here, regardless of the wife's actions. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
