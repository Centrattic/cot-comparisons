A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about continuing to be friends with Liz after promising not to. \n\nFirst, the situation started when the author shared a conversation with his wife where Liz was considering her relationship. The wife misunderstood the conversation, thinking the author was suggesting Liz should leave her girlfriend. The wife then demanded that the author stop being friends with Liz. He agreed to stop, but in reality, they stayed friends at work.\n\nNow, the wife found out he was still texting Liz and is upset. The author is asking if he's wrong for lying about cutting ties. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, honesty is crucial. Even if the wife was acting out of jealousy or misunderstanding, the author made a promise to her. Keeping that promise, even if he believes the wife was wrong, is important. By lying, he broke trust, which is a big deal in a marriage. The wife's method of checking his phone is not ideal, but the author's dishonesty is also a problem. \n\nEven though the wife might be acting out of anger or mood swings, the author's choice to continue the friendship and lie about it undermines the trust and respect needed in a relationship. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for the lie, regardless of the circumstances.\n"
