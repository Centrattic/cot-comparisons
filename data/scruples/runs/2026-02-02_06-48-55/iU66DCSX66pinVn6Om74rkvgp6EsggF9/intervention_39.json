A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a female coworker Liz who started dating someone, then broke up. The author was talking to his wife about Liz's texts, and Liz made a comment that the wife misinterpreted. The wife then told the author not to be friends with Liz anymore, but the author continued the friendship. When the wife found out, she went through his phone, and now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the lie about still being friends with Liz after promising not to. The author told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her, but he kept in touch. That's a direct lie. Even if the reason was to avoid conflict or because they were still working together, the lie itself is the issue.\n\nAlso, the wife's method of checking his phone is problematic. Using a time of the month excuse (which is a common stereotype) to act irrationally might not be fair, but the author's dishonesty is a separate issue. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, so the question is whether the answer should be A or B.\n\nIn relationships, trust is key. If you promise someone you'll stop doing something, and you don't, that's a breach of trust. The author's lie is intentional to avoid confrontation but still harmful. The wife's actions (checking the phone) are also wrong, but the focus here is on the author's actions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for lying.\n"
