A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who lied to his wife about not being friends with a female coworker, Liz. The wife found out he was still texting her and is upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements. The author had a conversation with Liz where he advised her to end the relationship if she didn't feel a certain way. Then, he told his wife that he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to appease her, even though they actually stayed in contact at work. Later, the wife discovered this and confronted him, leading to the question of who is at fault.\n\nLooking at the actions: The author promised his wife that he would stop being friends with Liz but continued to communicate with her. That's a straightforward lie. The wife's anger is justified because he broke a promise. Even if she went through his phone, which is generally considered an invasion of privacy, the initial lie is still a problem. \n\nBut why did he lie? He mentions that his wife was upset and he wanted to appease her. Maybe he thought it was necessary to keep the peace, but lying in a relationship can erode trust. The wife's action of checking the phone might be her way of seeking security, but that doesn't make it right. However, the core issue here is the deception. Relationships require honesty and trust, and the author's decision to lie about ending the friendship, even if it was to avoid conflict, is a breach of that trust. \n\nAdditionally, the wife's reaction could be influenced by her own emotions, as mentioned it's \"that time of the month\" and she's moody. But the author's choice to withhold the truth and maintain contact despite the promise is the main issue. The fact that they are coworkers complicates things a bit, but if the wife's concern was about the nature of their relationship, then maintaining contact even as friends could be problematic. However, the lie itself is still the primary wrong here. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't keep the promise he made to his wife. The wife's phone checking is also a problem, but the central issue is the dishonesty. The author should have been honest from the start rather than lying to prevent conflict, especially when it comes to a relationship where trust is crucial.\n"
