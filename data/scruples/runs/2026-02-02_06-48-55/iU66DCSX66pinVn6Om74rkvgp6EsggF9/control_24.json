A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about lying to his wife about maintaining a friendship with a female coworker named Liz after his wife had become upset.\n\nFirst, the author's wife was angry because she thought the author was implying that Liz might want to have sex with him and that he was badmouthing his wife. The author tried to explain, but she didn't believe him and told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author agreed not to, but in reality, they stayed friends at work. Now, the wife found out through going through his phone that he was still in contact with Liz, leading to the question of who is at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author lied about cutting ties with Liz, and the wife went through his phone to discover this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for the lie, or if the wife is the problem for invading his privacy.\n\nFrom a trust perspective, lying in a relationship is generally considered wrong. Even if there's a reason, like trying to appease the wife, the act of lying is a breach of trust. The author didn't actually follow through on the promise to cut ties, which is dishonest. However, the wife's actions of going through his phone without permission are also a privacy violation. \n\nBut in most cases, maintaining trust is crucial. The author chose to lie instead of being honest, which could have led to a discussion. Even if the wife was overreacting, the author should have been truthful. The wife's anger might be justified if the author didn't address the underlying issue (like why she misinterpreted the conversation with Liz) and instead covered up the friendship. \n\nThe author's lie, while perhaps intended to avoid conflict, is a significant issue. The wife's privacy violation is also wrong, but the primary question is about the author's actions. Since he broke his promise and lied, he is likely in the wrong, even if the wife's actions were also inappropriate. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
