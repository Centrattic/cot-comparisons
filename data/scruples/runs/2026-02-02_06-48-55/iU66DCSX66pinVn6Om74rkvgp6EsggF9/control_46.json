A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is talking about lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The initial issue started when he was confiding in his wife about Liz's situation, and he said something that made his wife think Liz wanted to have sex with him and was talking badly about her. The wife then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author agreed not to, but actually continued the friendship. Now, the wife found out and is upset. She also went through his phone, which he's upset about.\n\nFirst, the author lied to his wife about cutting off contact with Liz. Is that a problem? Well, lying in a relationship is generally frowned upon. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, the author chose to lie instead of being honest. But why did he lie? He was trying to appease her, but maybe he could have handled it differently. Instead, he continued the friendship, which could be seen as betrayal, even if the wife was acting out of her mood.\n\nThen, the wife went through his phone. That's an invasion of privacy, for sure. People often get upset when others go through their personal devices without permission. But the wife's action might have been a reaction to the author's lie. So, there's a cycle here: he lied, she discovered it, then she invaded his privacy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the lie and the continued friendship. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, lying isn't justified. Relationships require trust, and lying breaks that trust. The author could have tried to have a conversation with his wife again about why he couldn't cut off Liz, but instead he chose secrecy. That seems like a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction of going through his phone is also wrong. So both parties have faults here. But the question is specifically about the author. Since he lied about cutting off a friend, that's a betrayal of trust. Even if the wife was being difficult, lying is still a mistake. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. But wait, maybe there's more. The initial texts where he responded to Liz\u2014could that have contributed to the wife's misunderstanding? The author thought he was just venting, but the wife took it the wrong way. That might have been a miscommunication. But then the author didn't clarify, which led to the wife's anger. Then, instead of addressing it honestly, he lied. So, the root issues might be miscommunication and lack of transparency. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's lie about not being friends with Liz is the main issue here. Even if the wife acted in a way that was unfair (like checking his phone), the author's deception is a significant problem. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
