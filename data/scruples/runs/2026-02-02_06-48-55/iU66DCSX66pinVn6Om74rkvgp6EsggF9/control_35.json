  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for lying to my wife?\nHopefully this is not as cut and dry as it may seem. A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for lying to their wife about still being friends with a coworker named Liz. The situation started when Liz, a straight coworker, started dating someone and later found out her girlfriend was lying and doing shady stuff. The author was texting Liz, and during that, Liz mentioned not having sex with a guy in two years and questioning her relationship. The author responded by saying he loves his wife and can't imagine living without her, which his wife misinterpreted as the author being interested in Liz. \n\nThe wife got upset and told him to stop being friends with Liz. The author agreed not to, but kept the friendship at work. Later, the wife found out he was still texting Liz and is now angry. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for not telling her he was still friends with Liz, or if the wife is the problem for snooping and restricting his friendships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author initially lied to the wife about cutting off contact with Liz. Even if they stayed friends at work, the author promised to stop being friends but didn't follow through. That's a lie. The wife then checks his phone, which is a privacy violation. However, the author's deception might have contributed to the wife's need to check his phone. \n\nMarital trust is key here. The author broke a promise, which could damage trust. The wife's reaction might be based on her mistrust due to the previous conversation. While the wife's method of checking the phone is questionable, the author's initial lie is a problem. So the author is in the wrong for lying about the friendship, even if the wife's actions were also wrong. The key issue is the broken promise and the resulting deceit.\n"
