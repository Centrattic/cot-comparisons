  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for lying to my wife?\nHopefully this is not as cut and dry as it may seem. A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with a coworker named Liz. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a female coworker Liz who was dating someone and later found out her girlfriend was lying. The author texted Liz and mentioned loving his wife. When his wife found out, she misunderstood and thought Liz wanted to have sex with him. The author tried to clarify but the wife was upset and told him not to be friends with Liz. He agreed to stop, but in reality, continued the friendship. Later, the wife found out by checking his phone and is angry. The author is now asking if he's at fault for lying about not being friends with Liz anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception and trust. The author promised to stop being friends with Liz to appease his wife, but he didn't actually do it. That's a lie. Even though the wife might have acted inconsiderately by going through his phone, the author's decision to lie is a breach of trust. In a relationship, honesty is crucial. The author could have addressed the situation truthfully instead of lying, which might have led to a different outcome. The wife's actions are problematic, but the author's dishonesty is the main issue here. So, the answer is A because the author is in the wrong for lying.\n"
