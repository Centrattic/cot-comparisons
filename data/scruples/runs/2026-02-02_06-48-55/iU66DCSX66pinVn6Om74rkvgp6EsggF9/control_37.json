A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author lied to his wife about not being friends with a female coworker, Liz. The wife found out he was still texting her, and now she's mad. He's asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for lying or if his wife is the problem for going through his phone and telling him he can't be friends with Liz.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author had a conversation with Liz where he advised her about her relationship, and when he repeated that conversation to his wife, she misunderstood and became jealous. The wife then made the author promise not to be friends with Liz anymore, but he continued to text her. The wife later found out and confronted him, going through his phone to discover the texts. The author is now questioning if he was wrong to lie about not being friends with Liz, or if his wife was wrong for invading his privacy.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's decision to lie to his wife about maintaining contact with Liz after he promised otherwise. When someone asks you to stop seeing a person and you agree, but then continue the relationship in secret, that's a breach of trust. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and lying about keeping a promise can cause significant harm. The author's actions, even if he felt the wife was being unreasonable, still involved deceit. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's method of finding out the truth by going through his phone is also problematic. Privacy is important, and invading someone's privacy without consent is generally considered wrong. However, her initial request to cut ties with Liz was based on her misunderstanding, which the author could have clarified instead of lying. \n\nThe question is whether the author's deception outweighs his wife's privacy invasion. While her actions were wrong, the author's continued contact and lying after a promise is a more serious breach. The wife might have handled the situation differently, but the core issue is the author not being honest. \n\nSo, in terms of AITA, the author's lies and deceit are more harmful than the wife's privacy violation. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because he broke his promise and lied to his wife, which undermines trust in the relationship.\n"
