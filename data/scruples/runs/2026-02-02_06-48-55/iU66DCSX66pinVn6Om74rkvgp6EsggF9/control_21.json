A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a colleague, Liz, who started a relationship with a woman. Liz then discovered her girlfriend was lying and doing illegal stuff. The author was texting Liz and shared their conversation with his wife. At some point, Liz mentioned not having sex with a guy in two years and uncertainty about staying in the relationship. The author advised Liz to end it if she didn't feel she couldn't live without her. The wife took this as the author trying to seduce Liz, leading to her anger and a ban on the author being friends with Liz. The author agreed but didn't actually stop being friends, leading to the wife finding out he was still texting her. Now, the wife is angry about the lie and invading his privacy by checking his phone.\n\nSo, the key points here are the lies the author told. He promised his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore but continued to do so. When confronted, he lied about it. Then, the wife went through his phone to find out the truth. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom a relational standpoint, trust is crucial. When someone lies about their actions, especially regarding friendships that have caused marital tension before, it can be seen as a betrayal of trust. The author chose to deceive his wife, which is a clear act of dishonesty. Even if the wife overreacted initially, the author's response was to lie instead of addressing the issue honestly. Lying to avoid conflict or to protect privacy can backfire, as seen here.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions of checking his phone are also problematic. However, the user is specifically asking if the author is in the wrong. The act of lying is a direct violation of trust and honesty in a relationship. The wife's anger might stem from feeling deceived, which is a valid reaction. The author's decision to maintain the friendship despite the promise undermines the wife's feelings and shows a lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nEven if the wife's initial reaction was harsh (like not allowing the friendship), the author's response should have been to communicate and perhaps find a compromise rather than to lie. Lying perpetuates the problem and leads to further conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being truthful about the friendship. The wife's phone-checking is another issue, but it doesn't absolve the author of his dishonesty.\n"
