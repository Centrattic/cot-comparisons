A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves lying to his wife about still being friends with a female coworker, Liz, after their wife had a big issue with it.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author initially told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz, but he continued texting her. Then, when his wife found out by checking his phone, he's asking if he's at fault. \n\nFirst, when someone asks their partner to stop doing something (like being friends with someone), and the partner agrees but lies about continuing it, that's a breach of trust. Even if the wife's initial anger might be influenced by her mood (like PMS), the author made a promise he didn't keep. Lying to a partner about maintaining a friendship after agreeing to end it is a common issue in relationships where trust is a big component. \n\nAlso, the wife going through his phone is a questionable action, but the author's deception might have been the catalyst for her doing that. She might have felt the need to check because of his previous lie. \n\nHowever, the author did try to appease her by saying he wouldn't be friends with Liz, which he didn't follow through on. That's a clear lie. So, even if the wife's method of checking phone was wrong, the author's dishonesty is a problem. \n\nIn terms of ethics, honesty is usually valued in relationships. So, the author is in the wrong for lying about his continued friendship with Liz. The wife's action is also wrong, but the question is about the author. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he lied to his wife despite promising otherwise.\n"
