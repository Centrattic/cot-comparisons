A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about lying to his wife about still being friends with a coworker named Liz after his wife told him not to be. \n\nFirst, the author had a situation where his wife misunderstood some texts from Liz. The wife became upset and told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. He agreed but continued the friendship secretly. Now, the wife found out by going through his phone.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's lie is wrong. The wife's actions (checking the phone) are also questionable, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually a key factor. The author made a promise to his wife to stop being friends with Liz, and he broke that promise. Even if he had reasons, lying about it is a breach of trust. The wife might feel betrayed, which can harm the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's method of checking his phone is invasive and not okay. However, the question is about the author's actions. Lying to a spouse is generally considered wrong. The fact that he kept the friendship despite promising not to is a significant issue. \n\nThe wife's moodiness might be a factor, but that doesn't justify the lie. The author's deception is the main problem here. Even if the wife overstepped by checking the phone, the author's lie is still his fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A). Both parties have issues, but the lie is on him.\n"
