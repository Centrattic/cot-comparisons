A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz. The situation involves some texts where the author discussed a coworker's personal issues, which his wife misinterpreted. The wife then made him promise not to be friends with Liz anymore, but he didn't follow through and lied about it. Now she found out and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author lied to his wife about ending the friendship with Liz. Even though Liz was a coworker, the wife specifically asked him not to be friends anymore, and he broke that promise. Then, when confronted, he didn't come clean and instead kept the friendship secret. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is crucial. When someone asks you to stop something and you agree, then secretly continue it, that's a breach of trust. The wife's actions of checking the phone might be questionable, but the author's lying is also a problem. Even if the initial misunderstanding with Liz's texts was the catalyst, the author's decision to lie and keep the friendship going despite a promise is a significant issue. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was texting Liz after promising not to shows a lack of respect for his wife's feelings. The wife's anger is understandable given the betrayal. While the wife's method of checking his phone might be harsh, it doesn't excuse the author's deception. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for lying about the friendship. The answer should be A.\n"
