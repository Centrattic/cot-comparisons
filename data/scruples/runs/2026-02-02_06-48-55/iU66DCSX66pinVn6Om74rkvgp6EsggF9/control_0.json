A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about continuing to be friends with Liz after promising not to. \n\nFirst, the initial conflict started because the author texted his wife about their coworker Liz's relationship issues. The wife misinterpreted the conversation, thinking the author was flirting with Liz. The wife then demanded he stop being friends with Liz. The author agreed but secretly continued the friendship to appease her.\n\nNow, the wife found out through his phone that he was still in contact with Liz. The author didn't tell her he was lying, which is the crux of the issue here. The wife's justification for checking his phone is that he lied to her. \n\nFrom a trust perspective, lying to a spouse is a significant issue. Even if the wife was being unreasonable (like during \"that time of the month\"), the author's decision to continue the friendship behind her back could be seen as deceitful. The wife had a legitimate reason to want to cut off the friendship, and the author's dishonesty undermines the trust in their relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the wife's actions of checking his phone without consent are also problematic. But the primary question is about the author's accountability. Since the author made a promise he couldn't keep and then lied about it, he's the one who broke the trust first. The wife's reaction, while harsh, is a consequence of his dishonesty. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
