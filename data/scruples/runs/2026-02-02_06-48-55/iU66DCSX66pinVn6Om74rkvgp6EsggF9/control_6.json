A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. So the situation is that the author had a conversation with his wife where he said he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore after his wife was upset about something he said. But he actually continued to be friends with her at work.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author didn't tell his wife about continuing the friendship, which he agreed to end. That's a lie. But then the wife went through his phone, which is also an issue. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe main thing here is the act of lying. When someone asks you not to do something, like be friends with a person, and you agree, then you continue doing it, that's a breach of trust. Even if the wife's method of finding out (checking his phone) was invasive, the author's lie is still a problem. Trust in a relationship is important, and lying about something the partner specifically asked about can be seen as a betrayal. \n\nThe wife's anger might be justified because she felt lied to. The author tried to manage the situation by agreeing to end the friendship but didn't follow through. The wife's actions (checking the phone) are also not great, but that doesn't excuse the author's lie. \n\nSo, even though the wife's actions are wrong, the author is in the wrong for not being truthful. The key point is that he made a promise to stop the friendship and didn't keep it, which is a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
