A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about maintaining a friendship with a coworker named Liz. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore after a conflict, but he continued to text her. Then his wife found out by checking his phone and is upset. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception (lying about maintaining contact) and the wife's actions of checking the phone. The user is asking if the author is wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, trust is crucial. If the husband made a promise to his wife (to stop being friends with Liz) but kept in contact behind her back, that's a breach of trust. Even if he had good intentions, the act of lying undermines the relationship. \n\nHowever, the wife also invaded his privacy by checking his phone. That's a separate issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the focus is on him lying, even though the wife's action is problematic, the husband's deception is the primary issue here. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he lied to his wife, which is a significant issue in a relationship. The wife's privacy violation is a different matter, but it doesn't justify the husband's dishonesty.\n"
