A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dig into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. The key points here are the initial lie he told to his wife to appease her, followed by the fact that he continued the friendship, and then his wife discovered this by checking his phone. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author initially overheard Liz, a female coworker, confiding in him about her relationship. He then relayed the conversation to his wife, which led to a misunderstanding where his wife thought Liz was interested in him and that he was badmouthing her. The wife's reaction was to cut off the friendship, and the author agreed not to be friends with Liz to calm things down. However, he didn't actually end the friendship and continued texting her, which his wife found out by going through his phone.\n\nSo, the main issue is the ongoing friendship and the lie about it. Even if the author's intention was to appease his wife, lying is generally a problem in relationships. Trust is crucial, and breaking a promise made to the spouse, even with good intentions, can be hurtful. The fact that he continued the friendship despite promising to stop suggests a lack of commitment to resolving the issue in good faith. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's method of checking his phone is also questionable. Privacy is important, and doing so without consent can be seen as a violation. However, the wife's action might have been driven by her feelings of betrayal due to the initial lie. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The lie about maintaining the friendship is a clear breach of trust. Even if the wife's behavior (checking the phone) was also wrong, the author's action in keeping the friendship after promising to end it is a significant issue. In relationships, honesty is typically expected, and the author's decision to lie to avoid conflict might not be a valid excuse. \n\nThe wife's anger could be partly due to her own actions (checking the phone), but the root cause is the author's dishonesty. So, while both parties have some faults, the primary responsibility for the lie lies with the author. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
