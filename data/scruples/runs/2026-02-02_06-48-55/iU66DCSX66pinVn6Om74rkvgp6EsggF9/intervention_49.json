A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz after their initial conflict.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's wife got upset when he shared a text from Liz where Liz questioned her relationship. The wife misinterpreted the conversation, thinking the author was insinuating something about her. The author tried to explain but couldn't convince her. To calm things down, he promised to cut off contact with Liz but actually continued being friends at work. Later, the wife found out he was still in touch and is now angry.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author made a promise to his wife to stop being friends with Liz, but he lied about keeping that promise. Even though he continued the friendship out of necessity at work, the lie itself is a problem. Honesty in relationships is crucial. By not being truthful, he breached trust. \n\nThe wife going through his phone is also an issue, but that's a separate problem. While her actions are wrong, the author's lie still stands. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, the author should have been honest. Maybe he could have had a conversation with her about the ongoing relationship if the initial promise was hard to keep. But instead, he chose to lie, which is a mistake. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he lied to his wife despite the circumstances. Both sides have faults, but the question is about the author's actions. The lie is the main issue here.\n"
