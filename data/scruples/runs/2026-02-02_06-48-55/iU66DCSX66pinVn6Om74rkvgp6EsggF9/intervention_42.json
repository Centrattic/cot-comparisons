A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author lied to his wife about not being friends with a female coworker named Liz after a conflict. The wife found out he was still texting Liz and confronted him. The author is wondering if he's the one at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author initially told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz to appease her, but continued the friendship secretly. Then the wife found out by checking his phone. The author feels his wife is overstepping by going through his phone, but he also admits to lying.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author made a promise to his wife that he didn't keep. Even if the reason was to maintain his friendship, lying about it is a breach of trust. The wife's action of checking his phone is a privacy issue, but the author's deception might be the root cause. When someone lies, it can lead to others taking actions to uncover the truth. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction might be influenced by her own moods, but that's not an excuse for the author's dishonesty. The key issue here is the author's decision to lie and maintain a friendship without being honest, which could have been handled differently. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and lying about such a thing, even if it's to avoid conflict, can be damaging.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's method of checking the phone is invasive, but the author's actions first created the situation where she felt the need to do that. So, while both parties have issues, the author's initial deception is the main problem here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for lying.\n"
