A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife. The situation involves a coworker named Liz who started dating a girl, and there was some drama. The author texted Liz, and then shared the conversation with his wife, which led to a misunderstanding. The wife took the author's words the wrong way, leading her to tell him not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author agreed not to, but continued the friendship secretly. Now the wife found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are deception and trust. The author lied about not being friends with Liz anymore. Even if the wife's initial reaction was overzealous, the author still chose to continue the friendship without being honest. Honesty is a cornerstone of trust in a relationship. By not telling his wife the truth, the author violated that trust. \n\nThen there's the issue of the wife going through his phone. That's understandable in some ways, especially since she felt betrayed. But that doesn't excuse the author's actions. The wife's actions might be inconsiderate, but the author's deceptiveness is the root problem here. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. Considering that the author made a promise not to be friends with Liz anymore and broke it by lying, the answer should be A. The wife's actions (checking the phone) are a consequence of the author's dishonesty. So, the author is in the wrong for lying, even if the wife's response was harsh.\n"
