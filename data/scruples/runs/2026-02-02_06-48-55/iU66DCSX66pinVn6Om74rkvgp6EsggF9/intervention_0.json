  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for lying to my wife?\nHopefully this is not as cut and dry as it may seem. A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author had a conversation with his wife where he mentioned Liz's texts about her relationship. He told his wife that Liz was confused about her feelings and that she needed to end the relationship if she didn't feel connected to her girlfriend. His wife took this the wrong way, interpreting it as Liz being interested in him. The wife then told the author not to be friends with Liz anymore, and he agreed not to. But in reality, they remained friends at work. Now, the wife found out he was still texting Liz and is upset. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for lying about continuing the friendship or if the wife is the one at fault for snooping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial lie about the friendship and the wife's response. The author didn't actually end the friendship as he promised. That's a lie, right? He told his wife one thing but did another. Even if the friendship was just work-related, he misrepresented his actions. Lies, whether big or small, can erode trust in a relationship. The wife's reaction might be extreme, but she did have a good reason to be upset if she felt betrayed. Also, the wife going through his phone is a privacy issue, which is a problem on her part. But the author's actions led to the situation where she felt the need to check his phone. \n\nThe author's reasoning might be that he didn't want to cause conflict, so he lied to keep the peace. However, lying to avoid conflict often leads to bigger problems. The wife's anger is justified because he broke his promise. Even if the friendship was innocent, the lie is still a breach of trust. The author should have been honest from the start and discussed with his wife why he felt the need to stay friends with Liz. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction could be influenced by her own moods and jealousy. She might have overreacted, but her discovery of the lie led to her anger. The fact that she went through his phone is also a privacy violation, but that doesn't absolve the author of his responsibility for lying. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author made a choice to lie about his friendship with Liz, which is a significant issue. The wife's actions are also problematic, but the author's lie is a primary cause here. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
