A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who lied to his wife about still being friends with his coworker Liz is in the wrong. He mentioned that he told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore after she was upset about the texts where Liz was talking about the relationship. But actually, he stayed in touch with Liz at work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is the lie. He promised his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz but continued to text her. Even if it's just work-related, he misrepresented their relationship. The wife didn't check the phone immediately, but now she found out he lied. Lying to a spouse, especially about something that affects their trust, is a big deal. \n\nThen there's the wife going through his phone. While that's a privacy violation, it's often seen as a response to the husband's deceit. If he had been honest from the start, maybe the wife wouldn't have felt the need to check his phone. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the husband is in the wrong because he lied, even if it's for appeasement. The wife's actions, although not justified, might be a reaction to the husband's dishonesty. So the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
