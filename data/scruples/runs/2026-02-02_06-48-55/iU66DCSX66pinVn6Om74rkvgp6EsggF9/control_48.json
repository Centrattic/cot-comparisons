A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore.\n\nFirst, the author initially lied to his wife about cutting off contact with Liz to appease her. Even though he tried to explain that Liz was just venting and that he still loves his wife, the wife didn't believe him. He then told her he'd stop being friends with Liz, but they continued their work friendship.\n\nNow, the wife found out he was still texting Liz. The author didn't correct her when she accused him of lying, so he's maintaining the original lie. The key point here is whether lying to a spouse is wrong. In many relationships, honesty is crucial. The author made a promise to stop being friends with Liz but broke it. Even if it was to avoid conflict, the act of lying undermines trust. \n\nAlso, the wife went through his phone, which is generally considered a privacy violation. However, her actions might be a reaction to the author's initial dishonesty. The question is whether the author's lie is worse than her privacy violation. \n\nMost people would argue that keeping a lie going to avoid conflict isn't the right approach. Honesty, even when uncomfortable, is usually the better choice in relationships. So the author is in the wrong for lying again and not being truthful about his continued friendship. The answer is A.\n"
