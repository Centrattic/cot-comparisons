A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man who lied to his wife about no longer being friends with a female coworker, Liz. The wife found out he was still texting her, and she went through his phone.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The man had a conversation with Liz about her relationship, which the wife overheard or was told about, leading to jealousy and a ban on the friendship. He then lied to his wife, saying they weren't friends anymore to appease her, but continued the friendship secretly. The wife later discovers the lie by checking his phone.\n\nThe question is about whether the man is at fault for lying about the friendship. Let's consider the factors involved. Lies in relationships often cause trust issues. Even if the intention was to avoid conflict, lying is generally considered a breach of trust. The wife's action of checking his phone is also questionable, but the user is focusing on the man's responsibility here.\n\nThe man chose to lie, which is a conscious decision. Even if he thought it was to protect the relationship, the lie can be seen as dishonest. The wife's anger stems from feeling deceived. The man didn't address the underlying issue (maybe Liz being a friend) but instead tried to placate her with a lie. That might have been a short-term fix but led to more problems.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the wife overreacted or invaded his privacy by looking through his phone. However, the core issue here is the man's choice to lie. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, so I should consider why. The lie is the main point. Even if the wife's method was wrong, the man's action of lying is a significant factor.\n\nAlso, the man's initial problem was venting about his wife to Liz. That could have contributed to the wife's insecurity. But the question is specifically about the lie regarding the friendship. So the lie to the wife is the key here.\n\nIn most relationship advice, honesty is emphasized. So lying about a friendship after a promise to stop it would likely be seen as wrong. The man's actions led to a breakdown in trust, which is a big issue. Therefore, Answer A (the author is in the wrong) seems appropriate. The wife's phone-checking is not excused, but the man's lie is the primary problem.\n"
