A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz after promising not to. \n\nFirst, the situation started when the author texted his wife about Liz's texts, which led to the wife misunderstanding and forbidding the friendship. The author agreed not to be friends with Liz to appease her, but then continued texting her secretly. Now the wife found out and is angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a promise to his wife not to be friends with Liz and broke that promise. Lying about it is a big deal. Even if the wife might have overreacted before, breaking a promise by lying isn't justified. The author's actions could erode trust, and trust is crucial in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the wife checking his phone is invasive, but the author's lie is still on him. Even if the wife's actions are questionable, the author shouldn't have lied. He had the choice to be honest from the start or set boundaries himself instead of making a false promise. \n\nThe author's excuse about \"appeasing her\" might be a way to avoid conflict, but it's not a valid reason to lie. The wife's anger is a result of the broken trust. While the wife's phone-checking is wrong, the author's dishonesty is the root issue here. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for lying about maintaining the friendship despite promising otherwise. The answer should be A.\n"
