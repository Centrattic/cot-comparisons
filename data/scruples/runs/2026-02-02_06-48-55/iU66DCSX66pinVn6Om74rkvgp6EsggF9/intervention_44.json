A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about lying to their wife about still being friends with a coworker, Liz.\n\nFirst, the author initially told their wife they wouldn't be friends with Liz after the wife was upset about the texts. But the author continued texting Liz at work. Then the wife found out through her phone and confronted them. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong by not telling the truth about the friendship, or if the wife is the problem for snooping.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made a promise to the wife to cut ties with Liz but broke that promise. Even though they stayed in touch at work, they lied about it. The wife then checked the phone, which is an invasion of privacy, but the author's lie is also a breach of trust.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The wife's action of going through the phone is not great, but the author's lie is also an issue. In relationships, honesty is usually important. Even if the author had their reasons, lying after making a promise to the wife is a problem. The author might have thought they were protecting the friendship, but the main issue is the dishonesty towards their spouse.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, which makes sense. The author chose to lie even though they knew the wife was sensitive about this. The wife's actions are wrong too, but the question is about the author's fault. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
