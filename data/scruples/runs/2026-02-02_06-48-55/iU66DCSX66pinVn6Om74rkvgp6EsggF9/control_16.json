A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about staying in touch with Liz. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a conversation with Liz where he gave advice about her relationship. Then, when his wife misinterpreted the conversation and became upset, he promised to stop being friends with Liz to appease her. However, he continued texting her at work. The wife later found out through her phone that he was still in contact, leading to a confrontation. She also went through his phone, which he seems to disapprove of.\n\nThe key points here are the lie about continuing the friendship and his wife's actions of checking his phone. The author didn't think he had to be completely honest about maintaining a professional relationship, but the wife felt betrayed. On the other hand, the wife's method of checking his phone without permission might be seen as overstepping, but that doesn't make the author's lie right.\n\nTrust is crucial in a relationship. By lying, the author broke that trust, even if it was to avoid conflict. The fact that they were still friends at work might be a work necessity, but he promised otherwise. His wife's anger is justified because he misrepresented his actions. The wife's phone-checking is also a problem, but the author's deception is the primary issue here. So, the author is in the wrong because he lied about his actions despite promising otherwise.\n"
