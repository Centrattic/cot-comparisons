A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong for lying to his wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a conversation with his wife, who misunderstood a message he sent to Liz. The wife thought he was implying that Liz wanted to have sex with him and that he was badmouthing her. The wife then made him promise not to be friends with Liz. However, he continued to be friends with her at work. Now, the wife found out and is upset. The author didn't tell her he was still friends with Liz, and she went through his phone to find out.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author lied to his wife about cutting off contact with Liz. He said he would stop being friends, but he didn't. Then, when confronted, he claims he was just giving her space during her time of the month. The wife went through his phone, which is a privacy issue, but the author's deception is the main point here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to analyze. The author made a promise to his wife that he didn't keep. Even if the wife was being unreasonable, he chose to lie rather than address her concerns. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and lying about maintaining contact with someone the wife is distrustful of can be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, the wife's actions of going through his phone without permission are also a problem. She violated his privacy. But the original issue is the author's deception. Even if the wife was acting unreasonably, the author's choice to lie instead of being honest is problematic. Relationships require honesty, especially when there's existing tension. By lying, he escalated the conflict instead of resolving it.\n\nAnother angle: The wife's reason for wanting him to stop being friends with Liz was based on a misunderstanding. The author didn't clarify that he was being supportive, not suggesting anything romantic. Maybe the author should have addressed the misunderstanding rather than just agreeing to cut off contact. But he didn't, and then lied about it. So he's at fault for both the initial miscommunication and the subsequent lie.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the author's actions (lying) are a significant issue. The wife's actions (checking phone) are also wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he made a promise and broke it through deception, I think he's in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
