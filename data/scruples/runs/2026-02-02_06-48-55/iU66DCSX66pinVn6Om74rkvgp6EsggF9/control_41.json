A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author lied to his wife about still being friends with a female coworker named Liz. The wife found out through her phone, which she went through, and now there's a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author initially had a conversation with Liz where things got a bit personal. The author then relayed this to his wife, but his wife misunderstood, thinking the author was suggesting Liz wanted to have sex with him. The wife then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. The author agreed not to, but continued being friends at work. Later, the wife found out he was still texting Liz, hence the lie.\n\nSo, the main issue is about honesty in the marriage. The author didn't follow through on the promise to cut ties with Liz, which he told his wife he would do. Even though he might have had a reason to stay friendly at work, keeping that secret and not being truthful about it could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nBut wait, the author might say he was just trying to keep the peace, since his wife was already upset. However, lying about it led to a bigger problem. Also, the wife's method of checking his phone is not ideal, but that doesn't justify the husband's lie. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for lying. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. Even if the wife's actions (checking the phone) were wrong, lying to her about a promise he made can't be right. The author didn't have a valid reason to continue texting Liz if he had promised not to. So, the lie is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
