A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband lying to his wife about no longer being friends with a coworker named Liz after their argument.\n\nSo, the key points here: The husband initially lied to his wife by saying he wasn't friends with Liz anymore to appease her, but they continued to be friends at work. Then, the wife found out and confronted him. The husband didn't tell the truth when asked, leading to the wife checking his phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of lying in a relationship. Trust is a big component in marriage. If the wife asked him not to be friends with Liz, and he agreed but continued, that's a breach of trust. Even if the wife might have acted inconsiderately by checking his phone (which is generally wrong), the husband's lie is a problem. \n\nThe husband's intention was to avoid conflict initially, but lying about maintaining a friendship is a serious issue. The wife's anger stems from feeling deceived. While the wife's method of checking his phone is inappropriate, the husband's dishonesty is the root cause. \n\nSo, even though both parties might have flaws, the central issue here is the husband's lie. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
