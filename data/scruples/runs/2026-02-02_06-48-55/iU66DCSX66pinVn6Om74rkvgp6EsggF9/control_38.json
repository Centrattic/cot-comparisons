  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for lying to my wife?\nHopefully this is not as cut and dry as it may seem. A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the husband had a female coworker, Liz, who was dating someone else. Liz started talking to him about her relationship issues. The husband shared these texts with his wife, but during that, Liz mentioned not having sex with guys in two years and maybe ending the relationship. The husband responded by comparing his love for his wife, which his wife took the wrong way, thinking he wanted to have sex with Liz. The wife then told him not to be friends with Liz anymore. He agreed not to, but continued being friends at work. Later, the wife found out he was still texting Liz and got angry. He's asking if he was wrong to lie or if she was wrong for checking his phone.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the husband was wrong to lie about not being friends with Liz. The key points here are trust and communication. When the wife asked him not to be friends with Liz, he promised not to, but continued the friendship. That's a lie. Even if the wife did go through his phone, which is also a breach of privacy, the fact remains that he didn't honor his promise. Lying to his wife, regardless of the other's actions, is a breach of trust. So, while the wife's actions aren't right either, the husband's dishonesty is a problem. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
