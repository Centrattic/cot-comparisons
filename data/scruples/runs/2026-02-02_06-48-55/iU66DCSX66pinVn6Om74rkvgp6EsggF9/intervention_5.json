A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to his wife about still being friends with Liz after promising not to. \n\nFirst, the situation started when the author relayed Liz's private confessions to his wife. That might have caused the initial conflict, but the main issue here is the ongoing friendship. The author told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz anymore to avoid further conflict, but he continued the friendship anyway. Then, when confronted, he lied about it. \n\nThe wife discovered the deception by checking his phone, which might be a privacy issue. However, the author's decision to lie about cutting ties is a key point here. Even if the wife's actions (checking the phone) are questionable, the author broke his promise and was dishonest. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and maintaining contact despite a clear agreement to stop could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe author might argue that the friendship was necessary at work, but he had already agreed to stop, so continuing without transparency is problematic. Also, the wife's reason for checking the phone might be valid if she felt betrayed. \n\nSo, while both sides have valid points, the author's dishonesty is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
