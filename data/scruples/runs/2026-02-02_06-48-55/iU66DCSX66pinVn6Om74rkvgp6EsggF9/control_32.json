A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author lying to his wife about not being friends with a coworker, Liz, after a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a conversation with Liz where Liz was considering ending her relationship because of her girlfriend's deceit. The author shared this with his wife, but she misinterpreted it, leading to a rift. The author then agreed not to be friends with Liz to appease his wife but secretly continued the friendship. Now, the wife found out and is upset, leading to the question of who's at fault.\n\nThe user wants a judgment on whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The analysis needs to consider deception, trust, and the wife's actions as well.\n\nThe author lied about maintaining a friendship, which is a breach of trust. Even if the wife's initial reaction was overzealous (like reading the phone), the author's decision to lie and continue the relationship behind her back is problematic. Trust is foundational in a relationship, and lying, regardless of the reason, can be damaging. The wife's actions (checking phone) are also questionable, but the author's deception is a clear issue. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
