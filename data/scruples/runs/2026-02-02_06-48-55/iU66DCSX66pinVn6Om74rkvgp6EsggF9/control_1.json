  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for lying to my wife?\nHopefully this is not as cut and dry as it may seem. A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their wife about not being friends with Liz anymore. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was texting Liz, a female coworker who was dating someone else. The author shared some private texts with his wife, which led to her misunderstanding and cutting off Liz. Then, he told his wife he wouldn't be friends with Liz, but they stayed in touch at work. Now, the wife found out he was still texting Liz and is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial conversation where the author shared Liz's texts with his wife. The wife misinterpreted the conversation, thinking Liz was into the author. The author tried to clarify but couldn't convince her. He then lied about not being friends with Liz to appease her, but continued the friendship secretly. \n\nThe wife later checks his phone and finds the messages, leading to conflict. The question is whether the author was wrong for lying about the friendship.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust is crucial. Even if the author's intentions were good to avoid conflict, lying to his wife about a friendship, especially after she expressed concern, could damage trust. The wife's actions of checking his phone are also problematic, but that doesn't excuse the author's dishonesty. The author chose to deceive instead of being transparent, which is a breach of trust. Even if the wife overreacted initially, the author's decision to continue the friendship and lie about it is a clear wrongdoing. \n\nAdditionally, maintaining a friendship with someone the spouse is uncomfortable with, despite knowing it's a sensitive issue, shows a lack of consideration for the wife's feelings. The author should have addressed the situation with honesty, perhaps discussing boundaries with Liz instead of hiding the friendship. So, the author is in the wrong for lying and not being transparent.\n"
