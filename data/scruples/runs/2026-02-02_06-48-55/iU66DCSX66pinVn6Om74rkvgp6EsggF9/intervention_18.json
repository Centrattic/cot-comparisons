A couple years ago a female coworker (we\u2019ll call her Liz) started dating another girl. Up until this point, Liz was straight. Apparently Liz eventually found out that her girlfriend had been lying to her and had been doing some pretty shady (and illegal) stuff. Liz was obviously upset by this and was confiding in me via text. I was reading the text to my wife to fill her in on the situation and in a long stream of texts, Liz said something like \u201cI haven\u2019t had sex with a guy in two years. I don\u2019t know if I want to continue in this relationship.\u201d I responded with \u201cI know I vent to you about my wife a lot, but I love her more than anything and can\u2019t imagine my life without her. If you don\u2019t feel like you can\u2019t live without her, then you need to end it.\u201d My wife took that as \u201cshe wants to have sex with you and all you do is talk shit about me to her.\u201d As much as I tried to convince her otherwise, she wasn\u2019t having it. She basically told me she didn\u2019t want me to be friends with Liz anymore. To appease her, I told her I wouldn\u2019t. However, Liz and I stayed friends at work. Fast forward to this week, and my wife has been acting unreasonably angry towards me. (Not to be a dick, but it is that time of the month, and she does get very moody). So I just gave her some space. Today, she confronts me that she went through my phone and saw that I had been texting with Liz and that I lied to her about not being friends with her anymore. AITA for not telling her I\u2019m still friends with Liz, or is my wife that asshole for telling me I can\u2019t be and then going through my phone?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for lying to their wife about still being friends with a coworker, Liz. The situation started when the coworker was dating someone who lied to her, and the author was confiding in his wife about Liz's texts. In the process, he said something that made his wife think Liz was interested in him, leading to her cutting off Liz as a friend. The author then agreed not to be friends with Liz but continued to be so at work. Now, the wife found out and is angry, and the author is wondering if he did wrong by lying about still being friends.\n\nFirst, the author kept a secret about still being friends with Liz despite promising his wife he wouldn't. Even if the wife was in a bad mood and might have acted irrationally, the author broke a trust by not following through on his promise. Trust is a big part of relationships, so keeping that secret could be seen as wrong. Also, the initial situation where he might have led his wife to believe Liz had feelings for him could have caused the initial conflict. Even if the wife overreacted, the author's actions contributed to the problem. The wife's method of checking the phone is also questionable, but the author's dishonesty is a key point here. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
